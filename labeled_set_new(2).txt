10.1016/j.jep.2011.08.069  |  Treatment, Drug Discovery  |  Treatment  |  Neural Network  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Ethnopharmacological relevance:  Danshensu is an active water-soluble component from Salvia Miltiorrhiza, which has been demonstrated holding multiple mechanisms for the regulation of cardiovascular system. However, the relative contribution of danshensu to its multiple cardiovascular activities remains largely unknown. 
  Aim of the study:  To develop an artificial neural network (NN) model simultaneously characterizing danshensu pharmacokinetics and multiple cardiovascular activities in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) rats. The relationship between danshensu pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) were evaluated using contribution values. 
  Materials and methods:  Danshensu was intraperitoneally injected at a single dose of 20mg/kg to AMI rats induced by coronary artery ligation. Plasma levels of danshensu, cardiac troponin T (cTnT), total homocysteine (Hcy) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were quantified. A back-propagation NN model was developed to characterize the PK and PD profiles of danshensu, in which the input variables contained time, area under plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of danshensu and rat weights (covariate). Relative contribution of input variable to the output neurons was evaluated using neuron connection weights according to Garson's algorithm. The kinetics of contribution values was also compared and was validated using bootstrap resampling method. 
  Results:  Danshensu exerted significant cTnT-lowering, Hcy- and GSH-elevating effect, and these marker profiles were well captured by the trained NN model. The calculation of relative contributions revealed that the effect of danshensu on the PD marker could be ranked as cTnT&gt;GSH&gt;Hcy, while the effect of AMI disease on the PD marker could be ranked in the following order: cTnT&gt;Hcy&gt;GSH. The activity of transsulfuration pathway was quite obvious under the AMI state. 
  Conclusion:  NN is a powerful tool linking PK and PD profiles of danshensu with multiple cardioprotective mechanisms, it provides a simple method for identifying and ranking relative contribution to the multiple therapeutic effects of the drug.

10.1117/1.3646916  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Treatment  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Treatment  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Biomarkers are indicators of biological processes and hold promise for the diagnosis and treatment of disease. Gliomas represent a heterogeneous group of brain tumors with marked intra- and inter-tumor variability. The extent of surgical resection is a significant factor influencing post-surgical recurrence and prognosis. Here, we used fluorescence and reflectance spectral signatures for in vivo quantification of multiple biomarkers during glioma surgery, with fluorescence contrast provided by exogenously-induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) following administration of 5-aminolevulinic acid. We performed light-transport modeling to quantify multiple biomarkers indicative of tumor biological processes, including the local concentration of PpIX and associated photoproducts, total hemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and optical scattering parameters. We developed a diagnostic algorithm for intra-operative tissue delineation that accounts for the combined tumor-specific predictive capabilities of these quantitative biomarkers. Tumor tissue delineation achieved accuracies of up to 94% (specificity = 94%, sensitivity = 94%) across a range of glioma histologies beyond current state-of-the-art optical approaches, including state-of-the-art fluorescence image guidance. This multiple biomarker strategy opens the door to optical methods for surgical guidance that use quantification of well-established neoplastic processes. Future work would seek to validate the predictive power of this proof-of-concept study in a separate larger cohort of patients.

10.1109/TPAMI.2010.194  |  None  |  None, Other  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Projection methods have been used in the analysis of bitonal document images for different tasks such as page segmentation and skew correction for more than two decades. However, these algorithms are sensitive to the presence of border noise in document images. Border noise can appear along the page border due to scanning or photocopying. Over the years, several page segmentation algorithms have been proposed in the literature. Some of these algorithms have come into widespread use due to their high accuracy and robustness with respect to border noise. This paper addresses two important questions in this context: 1) Can existing border noise removal algorithms clean up document images to a degree required by projection methods to achieve competitive performance? 2) Can projection methods reach the performance of other state-of-the-art page segmentation algorithms (e.g., Docstrum or Voronoi) for documents where border noise has successfully been removed? We perform extensive experiments on the University of Washington (UW-III) data set with six border noise removal methods. Our results show that although projection methods can achieve the accuracy of other state-of-the-art algorithms on the cleaned document images, existing border noise removal techniques cannot clean up documents captured under a variety of scanning conditions to the degree required to achieve that accuracy.

Participants performed a triple-task in which intermediate task information needs to be updated frequently. Previous work has shown that the associated resource - the problem state resource - acts as a bottleneck in multitasking. The model-based method was used to locate the neural correlates of 'problem state replacements'. To analyze the fMRI data, we fit the computational process model to the behavioral data and regressed the model's activity against the fMRI data. The brain region responsible for the temporary representation of problem states, the inferior parietal lobule, and the brain region responsible for long-term storage of problem states, the inferior frontal gyrus were thus identified. These results show that model-based fMRI analyses can be performed using high-level symbolic cognitive models, enabling fine-grained exploratory fMRI research.

10.1037/a0022988  |  Other  |  Prognosis  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Caching and recovery of food by corvids is well-studied, but some ambiguous results remain. To help clarify these, we built a computational cognitive model. It is inspired by similar models built for humans, and it assumes that memory strength depends on frequency and recency of use. We compared our model's behavior to that of real birds in previously published experiments. Our model successfully replicated the outcomes of two experiments on recovery behavior and two experiments on cache site choice. Our "virtual birds" reproduced declines in recovery accuracy across sessions, revisits to previously emptied cache sites, a lack of correlation between caching and recovery order, and a preference for caching in safe locations. The model also produced two new explanations. First, that Clark's nutcrackers may become less accurate as recovery progresses not because of differential memory for different cache sites, as was once assumed, but because of chance effects. And second, that Western scrub jays may choose their cache sites not on the basis of negative recovery experiences only, as was previously thought, but on the basis of positive recovery experiences instead. Alternatively, both "punishment" and "reward" may be playing a role. We conclude with a set of new insights, a testable prediction, and directions for future work.

10.3382/japr.2010-00266  |  None  |  Prognosis  |  Neural Network  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Several mathematical or statistical and artificial intelligence models were developed to compare egg production forecasts in commercial layers. Initial data for these models were collected from a comparative layer trial on commercial strains conducted at the Poultry Research Farms, Auburn University. Simulated data were produced to represent new scenarios by using means and SD of egg production of the 22 commercial strains. From the simulated data, random examples were generated for neural network training and testing for the weekly egg production prediction from wk 22 to 36. Three neural network architectures-back-propagation-3, Ward-5, and the general regression neural network-were compared for their efficiency to forecast egg production, along with other traditional models. The general regression neural network gave the best-fitting line, which almost overlapped with the commercial egg production data, with an R(2) of 0.71. The general regression neural network-predicted curve was compared with original egg production data, the average curves of white-shelled and brown-shelled strains, linear regression predictions, and the Gompertz nonlinear model. The general regression neural network was superior in all these comparisons and may be the model of choice if the initial overprediction is managed efficiently. In general, neural network models are efficient, are easy to use, require fewer data, and are practical under farm management conditions to forecast egg production.

10.1007/s00268-010-0938-x  |  Robotics  |  Robotics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Application of the robot for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass has been slow to evolve, despite its rapid acceptance in other fields. This is largely due to associated costs of technology, reports of increased operative time, and inadequate data available to correlate the benefits of robotics to a clinical outcome. The authors present a comparative study between laparoscopic and robot-assisted Roux-en-Y gastric bypass performed at a specialized institution for robotic surgery. 
  Materials and method:  A total of 135 consecutive Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedures were performed from January 2006 to December 2009 by a single surgeon. The first 45 were performed laparoscopically and the remaining 90 were robot-assisted. Patient demographics, operative time, complication rate, length of stay, long-term weight loss, and follow-up for the two groups were gathered from a prospectively maintained database and statistically analyzed. 
  Results:  The overall operative time was significantly shorter for the robot-assisted procedures than for the laparoscopic procedures (207 ± 31 vs. 227 ± 31 min) (P = 0.0006). The robotic set-up time remained constant at 13 ± 4 min. 30 robotic cases were necessary in order to perform the procedure in less time than with the laparoscopic approach (P = 0.047). Mortality was 0% in both groups, with no conversions to open surgery and no transfusions. Early morbidities and percentage of excess weight loss at 1 year were comparable for the two groups. 
  Conclusions:  The use of the robot for performing the gastrojejunostomy during laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass does not increase the operative time or the rate of specific complications. The short-term outcomes of the robot-assisted procedure are comparable to those found with the conventional laparoscopic method.

Using a two-armed bandit situation, we simulated several processes that might explain the trade-off between exploring and exploiting. They included an optimising model, dynamic backward sampling; a dynamic version of the matching law; the Rescorla-Wagner model; a neural network model; and ɛ-greedy and rule of thumb models derived from the study of reinforcement learning in artificial intelligence. Under conditions like those used in published studies of birds' performance under two-armed bandit conditions, all models usually identified the more profitable source of reward, and did so more quickly when the reward probability differential was greater. Only the dynamic programming model switched from exploring to exploiting more quickly when available time in the situation was less. With sessions of equal length presented in blocks, a session-length effect was induced in some of the models by allowing motivational, but not memory, carry-over from one session to the next. The rule of thumb model was the most successful overall, though the neural network model also performed better than the remaining models.

We aim to determine whether these pathological factors are associated with adverse pathologic features after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP). 
  Methods:  All 407 patients who underwent RALP with pelvic lymphadenectomy between July 2005 and December 2009 were analyzed, retrospectively. We investigated the association of these three pathological parameters with adverse pathological findings in RALP specimen and biochemical recurrence using Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank test and a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. 
  Results:  The PNI and LVI were significantly associated with a higher pathological stage, a higher pathological Gleason score, a higher tumor volume in RALP specimen, a higher frequency of positive surgical margins, and a higher frequency of seminal vesicle invasion. In addition, PNI correlated with preoperative PSA, clinical stage, and Gleason score on needle biopsy. However, the HGPIN was not significantly associated with the clinicopathological characteristics studied. Using log-rank test, presence of PNI (P &lt; 0.001) increases the probability of biochemical recurrence. On multivariate analysis, all three pathological parameters were not significantly correlated with biochemical recurrence. 
  Conclusion:  Although presence of PNI and LVI in RALP specimen correlated with multiple adverse clinicopathological factors, it did not predict biochemical recurrence, thus limiting its clinical usefulness. HGPIN was not significantly associated with the clinicopathological characteristics studied.

In this study, different biomarkers (i.e. Ca²⁺-ATPase activity, lysosomal membrane stability-LMS, lysosomal lipofuscin and neutral lipid content) were utilized to evaluate the alterations in the physiological status of animals, induced by exposure for 3d to different sublethal concentrations of TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) (1.5 × 10⁻³, 1.5 × 10⁻², 1.5×10⁻¹ ng mL⁻¹) utilizing the paper contact toxicity test. Lysosome/cytoplasm volume ratio and DNA damage were also evaluated as a biomarker at the tissue level and as a biomarker of genotoxicity, respectively. Moreover, the NR retention time assay conditions were optimized for the determination of in vivo LMS in earthworm coelomocytes. The results demonstrate that LMS and Ca²⁺-ATPase activity were early warning biomarkers able to detect the effects of minimal amounts of TCDD and that biomarkers evaluated at the tissue level are important for following the evolution of the stress syndrome in earthworms. To evaluate the health status of the animals, an Earthworm Expert System (EES) for biomarker data integration and interpretation was developed. The EES proved to be a suitable tool able to rank, objectively, the different levels of the stress syndrome in E. andrei induced by the different concentrations of TCDD.

  Objective:  To document complications after RARP by strict application of standardized reporting criteria. 
  Design, setting, and participants:  Between January 2005 and December 2009, 3317 consecutive patients underwent RARP at a tertiary referral center. Median follow-up was 24.2 mo (interquartile range: 12.4-36.9). 
  Intervention:  Transperitoneal RARP was performed by one of five surgeons-two experienced, three beginners. 
  Measurements:  Complications were captured by exhaustive review of multiple datasets, including our prospective prostate cancer database, claims data, and electronic medical and institutional morbidity and mortality records, and reported according to the Martin-Donat criteria. Complications were stratified by type (medical/surgical), Clavien classification, and timing of onset. Multivariable analysis of factors predictive of complications was performed. 
  Results and limitations:  The median hospitalization time was 1 d. There were 368 complications in 326 patients (9.8%), including a transfusion rate of 2.2%. We detected 79 medical complications in 78 patients (2.4%) and 289 surgical complications in 264 patients (8.0%). There were 242 minor (Clavien 1-2) and 126 major (Clavien 3-5) complications. Two hundred ninety-nine (81.3%) complications occurred within 30 d, 17 (4.6%) within 31-90 d, and 52 (14.1%) after 90 d from surgery. On multivariable analysis, preoperative prostate-specific antigen values and cardiac comorbidity were predictive for medical complications, whereas age, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and biopsy Gleason score were predictive of surgical complications. Limitations of this study include representing results from a single high-volume referral center and not including the learning curve of the two most experienced surgeons. 
  Conclusions:  RARP is a safe operation, with an overall complication rate of 9.8%. Most complications occurred within 30 d of surgery.

  Design:  Single-institution retrospective review. 
  Setting:  Tertiary care center. 
  Patients:  Patients undergoing completed robotic-assisted pancreatic resection and reconstruction at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, between October 3, 2008, and February 26, 2010. 
  Main outcome measures:  Primary pathology, operative time, operative blood loss, perioperative blood transfusions, pancreatic fistula, 90-day morbidity and mortality, and readmission rate. 
  Results:  Thirty patients with a median age of 70 years (range, 32-85 years) underwent completed robotic-assisted pancreatic resection and reconstruction. Procedures were robotic-assisted non-pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (n = 24), robotic-assisted central pancreatectomy (n = 4), and the robotic-assisted Frey procedure (n = 2). The median operative time was 512 minutes (range, 327-848 minutes). The median blood loss was 320 mL (range, 50-1000 mL), with a median length of hospital stay of 9 days (range, 4-87 days). The final diagnoses included periampullary adenocarcinoma (n = 7), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (n = 6), pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (n = 5), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (n = 4), mucinous cystic neoplasm (n = 3), serous cystic adenoma (n = 2), chronic pancreatitis (n = 2), and solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (n = 1). There was 1 postoperative death. The overall pancreatic fistula rate was 27% (n = 8). The clinically significant pancreatic fistula rate (International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula grades B and C) was 10% (n = 3). Clavien grade III and IV complications occurred in 7 patients (23%), while Clavien grade I and II complications occurred in 8 patients (27%). 
  Conclusions:  Robotic-assisted complex pancreatic surgery can be performed safely in a high-volume pancreatic tertiary care center with perioperative outcomes comparable to those of open surgery. Advances in robotic technology and increasing experience may improve long operative times.

10.1007/s00464-011-1657-6  |  Robotics  |  Robotics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Intersphincteric resection (ISR) for low rectal cancer has been described as the ultimate sphincter-saving procedure. Laparoscopic ISR has been proved safe with early postoperative benefits. Recently, some colorectal surgeons have begun to perform robot-assisted ISR to harness the advantages of the da Vinci robotic system. The authors present their short-term results for a robotic technique of ISR. 
  Methods:  Data from 29 consecutive patients at a single institution with very low rectal cancer (&lt;4 cm) from the anal verge who underwent robot-assisted ISR were prospectively collected between December 2007 and March 2010. 
  Results:  The study enrolled 23 men and 6 women with a median age of 61.5 years (range, 36-82 years). Their median body mass index (BMI) was 23.3 kg/m(2) (range, 17.9-32.5 kg/m(2)). The median distance of the tumor from the anal verge was 3 cm (range, 1-4 cm). The median operative time was 325 min (range, 235-435 min), with a console time of 130 min (range, 110-210 min). There were no conversions to open surgery. A protecting ileostomy was performed for all the patients. The median blood loss was less than 50 ml (range, &lt; 50-1,000 ml). The median size of the tumor was 3 cm (range, 0-6.9 cm), and the median number of lymph nodes harvested was 16 (range, 1-44). The median distal margin was 0.8 cm (range, 0-4 cm), and one margin was positive. The circumferential margin was negative (&gt;2 mm) for 27 patients. Therefore, complete resection (R0) was achieved for 26 (90%) of the 29 patients. The median hospital stay was 9 days (range, 5-15 days). Nine patients experienced complications, including three anastomotic leaks (10%). All the leaks were managed conservatively. No surgical mortalities occurred. 
  Conclusion:  Robot-assisted intersphincteric resection for very low rectal cancer is feasible, and its short-term outcome is acceptable.

  Study design:  Records were reviewed for the first 27 RALM procedures at our institution. Age, BMI, insurance status, race, uterine size, and operative indication were used to select comparable patients who had undergone AM. Clinical and efficiency outcomes were compared stratifying for uterine size, specimen weight, and matched propensity scores. 
  Results:  IV hydromorphone use was significantly lower for RALM (P &lt; 0.01), with no significant differences in blood loss or complications. RALM patients had significantly shorter hospital stays; however, total hospital charges were higher (P &lt; 0.0001). This likely reflects longer operating room time (P &lt; 0.0001), which was magnified as specimen size increased (P &lt; 0.0001). 
  Conclusion:  RALM patients require less IV hydromorphone, have shorter hospital stays, and have generally equivalent clinical outcomes compared with AM patients. Additionally, as specimen size increased, the operative efficiency of RALM decreased compared with AM.

10.1088/1741-2560/8/6/065010  |  Robotics  |  Robotics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Rodent spatial navigation requires the dynamic evaluation of multiple sources of information, including visual cues, self-motion signals and reward signals. The nature of the evaluation, its dynamics and the relative weighting of the multiple information streams are largely unknown and have generated many hypotheses in the field of robotics. We use the framework of the traveling salesperson problem (TSP) to study how this evaluation may be achieved. The TSP is a classical artificial intelligence NP-hard problem that requires an agent to visit a fixed set of locations once, minimizing the total distance traveled. We show that after a few trials, rats converge on a short route between rewarded food cups. We propose that this route emerges from a series of local decisions that are derived from weighing information embedded in the context of the task. We study the relative weighting of spatial and reward information and establish that, in the conditions of this experiment, when the contingencies are not in conflict, rats choose the spatial or reward optimal solution. There was a trend toward a preference for space when the contingencies were in conflict. We also show that the spatial decision about which cup to go to next is biased by the orientation of the animal. Reward contingencies are also shown to significantly and dynamically modulate the decision-making process. This paradigm will allow for further neurophysiological studies aimed at understanding the synergistic role of brain areas involved in planning, reward processing and spatial navigation. These insights will in turn suggest new neural-like architectures for the control of mobile autonomous robots.

In this pilot study, we investigated the potential of serum Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for differentiating CHC patients with extensive hepatic fibrosis from those without fibrosis. Twenty-three serum samples from CHC patients were selected according to the degree of hepatic fibrosis as evaluated by the FibroTest: 12 from patients with no hepatic fibrosis (F0) and 11 from patients with extensive fibrosis (F3-F4). The FTIR spectra (ten per sample) were acquired in the transmission mode and data homogeneity was tested by cluster analysis to exclude outliers. After selection of the most discriminant wavelengths using an ANOVA-based algorithm, the support vector machine (SVM) method was used as a supervised classification model to classify the spectra into two classes of hepatic fibrosis, F0 and F3-F4. Given the small number of samples, a leave-one-out cross-validation algorithm was used. When SVM was applied to all spectra (n = 230), the sensitivity and specificity of the classifier were 90.1% and 100%, respectively. When SVM was applied to the subset of 219 spectra, i.e., excluding the outliers, the sensitivity and specificity of the classifier were 95.2% and 100%, respectively. This pilot study strongly suggests that the serum from CHC patients exhibits infrared spectral characteristics, allowing patients with extensive fibrosis to be differentiated from those with no hepatic fibrosis.

In this work, an online monitoring and alert system for upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors is developed on the basis of a set of novel evaluating indexes. The two indexes, i.e., stability index S and auxiliary index a, which incorporate both gas- and liquid-phase parameters for UASB, enable a quantitative and comprehensive evaluation of reactor status. A series of shock tests is conducted to evaluate the response of the monitoring and alert system to organic overloading, hydraulic, temperature, and toxicant shocks. The results show that this system enables an accurate and rapid monitoring and diagnosis of the reactor status, and offers reliable early warnings on the potential risks. As the core of this system, the evaluating indexes are demonstrated to be of high accuracy and sensitivity in process evaluation and good adaptability to the artificial intelligence and automated control apparatus. This online monitoring and alert system presents a valuable effort to promote the automated monitoring and control of anaerobic digestion process, and holds a high promise for application.

So far many techniques of this kind have been proposed as a means to analyze brain dynamics, but most of them are restricted to single-sensor measurements. Analyzing the dynamics in a channel-wise fashion is an invalid approach for multisite encephalographic recordings, since it ignores any pattern of coordinated activity that might emerge from the coherent activation of distinct brain areas. We suggest, here, the use of neural-gas algorithm (Martinez et al. in IEEE Trans Neural Netw 4:558-569, 1993) for encoding brain activity spatiotemporal dynamics in the form of a symbolic timeseries. A codebook of k prototypes, best representing the instantaneous multichannel data, is first designed. Each pattern of activity is then assigned to the most similar code vector. The symbolic timeseries derived in this way is mapped to a network, the topology of which encapsulates the most important phase transitions of the underlying dynamical system. Finally, global efficiency is used to characterize the obtained topology. We demonstrate the approach by applying it to EEG-data recorded from subjects while performing mental calculations. By working in a contrastive-fashion, and focusing in the phase aspects of the signals, we show that the underlying dynamics differ significantly in their symbolic representations.

10.1371/journal.pone.0019784  |  None  |  None, Other  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Understanding the structure of complex networks is a continuing challenge, which calls for novel approaches and models to capture their structure and reveal the mechanisms that shape the networks. Although various topological measures, such as degree distributions or clustering coefficients, have been proposed to characterize network structure from many different angles, a comprehensive and intuitive representation of large networks that allows quantitative analysis is still difficult to achieve. 
  Methodology/principal findings:  Here we propose a mesoscopic description of large networks which associates networks of different structures with a set of particular curves, using breadth-first search. After deriving the expressions of the curves of the random graphs and a small-world-like network, we found that the curves possess a number of network properties together, including the size of the giant component and the local clustering. Besides, the curve can also be used to evaluate the fit of network models to real-world networks. We describe a simple evaluation method based on the curve and apply it to the Drosophila melanogaster protein interaction network. The evaluation method effectively identifies which model better reproduces the topology of the real network among the given models and help infer the underlying growth mechanisms of the Drosophila network. 
  Conclusions/significance:  This curve-shaped description of large networks offers a wealth of possibilities to develop new approaches and applications including network characterization, comparison, classification, modeling and model evaluation, differing from using a large bag of topological measures.

We demonstrate these methods to data monitored in the urban areas of Thessaloniki and Helsinki in Greece and Finland, respectively. For this purpose, we applied the principal component analysis method in order to inter-compare the patterns of air pollution in the two selected cities. Then, we proceeded with the development of air quality forecasting models for both studied areas. On this basis, we formulated and employed a novel hybrid scheme in the selection process of input variables for the forecasting models, involving a combination of linear regression and artificial neural networks (multi-layer perceptron) models. The latter ones were used for the forecasting of the daily mean concentrations of PM₁₀ and PM₂.₅ for the next day. Results demonstrated an index of agreement between measured and modelled daily averaged PM₁₀ concentrations, between 0.80 and 0.85, while the kappa index for the forecasting of the daily averaged PM₁₀ concentrations reached 60% for both cities. Compared with previous corresponding studies, these statistical parameters indicate an improved performance of air quality parameters forecasting. It was also found that the performance of the models for the forecasting of the daily mean concentrations of PM₁₀ was not substantially different for both cities, despite the major differences of the two urban environments under consideration.

A new membership function for classifying the neuron of DCFMN is defined in which the noise, the geometric center of the hyperbox, and the data core are considered. Instead of using the contraction process of the FMNN described by Simpson, a kind of overlapped neuron with new membership function based on the data core is proposed and added to neural network to represent the overlapping area of hyperboxes belonging to different classes. Furthermore, some algorithms of online learning and classification are presented according to the structure of DCFMN. DCFMN has strong robustness and high accuracy in classification taking onto account the effect of data core and noise. The performance of DCFMN is checked by some benchmark datasets and compared with some traditional fuzzy neural networks, such as the fuzzy min-max neural network (FMNN), the general FMNN, and the FMNN with compensatory neuron. Finally the pattern classification of a pipeline is evaluated using DCFMN and other classifiers. All the results indicate that the performance of DCFMN is excellent.

Using a feature selection method with the computational architecture of the cross-entropy method, including an additional preliminary step ensuring a lower bound on the number of times any feature is considered, we show when testing on a human lymph node data set that there are a significant number of genes that perform well when their complementary power is assessed, but “pass under the radar” of popular feature selection methods that only assess genes individually on a given classification tool. We also show that this phenomenon becomes more apparent as diagnostic specificity of the tissue samples analysed increases.

This prediction problem must be formulated as a structured-output learning task, as the predicted parameters are strongly correlated. We introduce a model selection framework based on cross-validation with a parametrization-independent loss function suitable to the manifold of covariance matrices. Our model is based on constraining the conditional independence structure of functional activity by the anatomical connectivity. Subsequently, we learn a linear predictor of a stationary multivariate autoregressive model. This natural parameterization of functional connectivity also enforces the positive-definiteness of the predicted covariance and thus matches the structure of the output space. Our results show that functional connectivity can be explained by anatomical connectivity on a rigorous statistical basis, and that a proper model of functional connectivity is essential to assess this link.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.08.031  |  Other  |  None, Other  |  Generative Model  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Functional MRI studies have uncovered a number of brain areas that demonstrate highly specific functional patterns. In the case of visual object recognition, small, focal regions have been characterized with selectivity for visual categories such as human faces. In this paper, we develop an algorithm that automatically learns patterns of functional specificity from fMRI data in a group of subjects. The method does not require spatial alignment of functional images from different subjects. The algorithm is based on a generative model that comprises two main layers. At the lower level, we express the functional brain response to each stimulus as a binary activation variable. At the next level, we define a prior over sets of activation variables in all subjects. We use a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process as the prior in order to learn the patterns of functional specificity shared across the group, which we call functional systems, and estimate the number of these systems. Inference based on our model enables automatic discovery and characterization of dominant and consistent functional systems. We apply the method to data from a visual fMRI study comprised of 69 distinct stimulus images. The discovered system activation profiles correspond to selectivity for a number of image categories such as faces, bodies, and scenes. Among systems found by our method, we identify new areas that are deactivated by face stimuli. In empirical comparisons with previously proposed exploratory methods, our results appear superior in capturing the structure in the space of visual categories of stimuli.

Our aim was to construct a minimalist neural network that is able to parse artificial sentences of both grammars in an efficient way without using the biologically unrealistic backpropagation algorithm. The core of this network is a neural stack-like memory where the push and pop operations are regulated by synaptic gating on the connections between the layers of the stack. The network correctly categorizes novel sentences of both grammars after training. We suggest that the introduction of the neural stack memory will turn out to be substantial for any biological 'hierarchical processor' and the minimalist design of the model suggests a quest for similar, realistic neural architectures.

Although a general dynamical mechanism involved in agent-environment integration is still largely unknown for behavioural robustness, discussions here are focussed on one of the most plausible candidate: the formation of distributed mechanisms working in transient during agent-environment coupling. This article provides discussions on this sort of coordination based on a mobile object-tracking task with situated, embodied and minimal agents, and tests for robust yet adaptive behaviour. The proposed scenario provides examples of behavioural mechanisms that counterbalance the functional organization of internal control activity and agents' situatedness to enable the evolution of a two-agent interaction task. Discussions in this article suggest that future studies of distributed cognition should take into account that there are at least two possible modes of interpreting distributed mechanisms and that these have a qualitatively different effect on behavioural robustness.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.10.015  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis  |  Multiple-Kernel Support Vector Machine  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Different imaging modalities provide essential complementary information that can be used to enhance our understanding of brain disorders. This study focuses on integrating multiple imaging modalities to identify individuals at risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI, often an early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is difficult to diagnose due to its very mild or insignificant symptoms of cognitive impairment. Recent emergence of brain network analysis has made characterization of neurological disorders at a whole-brain connectivity level possible, thus providing new avenues for brain diseases classification. Employing multiple-kernel Support Vector Machines (SVMs), we attempt to integrate information from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) for improving classification performance. Our results indicate that the multimodality classification approach yields statistically significant improvement in accuracy over using each modality independently. The classification accuracy obtained by the proposed method is 96.3%, which is an increase of at least 7.4% from the single modality-based methods and the direct data fusion method. A cross-validation estimation of the generalization performance gives an area of 0.953 under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, indicating excellent diagnostic power. The multimodality classification approach hence allows more accurate early detection of brain abnormalities with greater sensitivity.

In this study, we investigate the possibility of enhancing the curvature detection of embedded tactile sensors by proposing a ridged fingertip structure, simulating human fingerprints. In addition, a curvature detection approach based on machine learning methods is proposed to provide the embedded sensors with the ability to discriminate the surface curvature of different objects. For this purpose, a set of experiments were carried out to collect tactile signals from a 2 × 2 tactile sensor array, then the signals were processed and used for learning algorithms. To achieve the best possible performance for our machine learning approach, three different learning algorithms of Naïve Bayes (NB), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were implemented and compared for various parameters. Finally, the most accurate method was selected to evaluate the proposed skin structure in recognition of three different curvatures. The results showed an accuracy rate of 97.5% in surface curvature discrimination.

Such measures are problematic as they are: 1) subjective, and 2) give no specific timing information. Coding pain as a series of facial action units (AUs) can avoid these issues as it can be used to gain an objective measure of pain on a frame-by-frame basis. Using video data from patients with shoulder injuries, in this paper, we describe an active appearance model (AAM)-based system that can automatically detect the frames in video in which a patient is in pain. This pain data set highlights the many challenges associated with spontaneous emotion detection, particularly that of expression and head movement due to the patient's reaction to pain. In this paper, we show that the AAM can deal with these movements and can achieve significant improvements in both the AU and pain detection performance compared to the current-state-of-the-art approaches which utilize similarity-normalized appearance features only.

Using logic programming we present a comprehensive and adaptative mathematical model to study the impact of folate deficiency, including folate transport and enzymes activities. 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate (5mTHF) uptake and DNA and dUMP methylation were studied by simulating nutritional 5mTHF deficiency and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene defects. Both conditions had distinct effects on 1CM metabolite synthesis. Simulating severe 5mTHF deficiency (25% of normal levels) modulated 11 metabolites. However, simulating a severe decrease in MTHFR activity (25% of normal activity) modulated another set of metabolites. Two oscillations of varying amplitude were observed at the steady state for DNA methylation with severe 5mTHF deficiency, and the dUMP/dTMP ratio reached a steady state after 2 h, compared to 2.5 h for 100% 5mTHF. MTHFR activity with 25% of V(max) resulted in an increased methylated DNA pool after half an hour. We observed a deviation earlier in the profile compared to 50% and 100% V(max). For dUMP methylation, the highest level was observed with 25%, suggesting a low rate of dUMP methylation into dTMP with 25% of MTHFR activity. In conclusion, using logic programming we were able to construct the 1CM for analyzing the dynamic system behavior. This model may be used to refine biological interpretations of data or as a tool that can provide new hypotheses for pathogenesis.

10.1016/j.artmed.2011.09.003  |  Genetics, Prognosis  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Genetics  |  Semi-Supervised Learning  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Objective:  Predicting or prioritizing the human genes that cause disease, or "disease genes", is one of the emerging tasks in biomedicine informatics. Research on network-based approach to this problem is carried out upon the key assumption of "the network-neighbour of a disease gene is likely to cause the same or a similar disease", and mostly employs data regarding well-known disease genes, using supervised learning methods. This work aims to find an effective method to exploit the disease gene neighbourhood and the integration of several useful omics data sources, which potentially enhance disease gene predictions. 
  Methods:  We have presented a novel method to effectively predict disease genes by exploiting, in the semi-supervised learning (SSL) scheme, data regarding both disease genes and disease gene neighbours via protein-protein interaction network. Multiple proteomic and genomic data were integrated from six biological databases, including Universal Protein Resource, Interologous Interaction Database, Reactome, Gene Ontology, Pfam, and InterDom, and a gene expression dataset. 
  Results:  By employing a 10 times stratified 10-fold cross validation, the SSL method performs better than the k-nearest neighbour method and the support vector machines method in terms of sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 79%, precision of 81%, accuracy of 82%, and a balanced F-function of 83%. The other comparative experimental evaluations demonstrate advantages of the proposed method given a small amount of labeled data with accuracy of 78%. We have applied the proposed method to detect 572 putative disease genes, which are biologically validated by some indirect ways. 
  Conclusion:  Semi-supervised learning improved ability to study disease genes, especially a specific disease when the known disease genes (as labeled data) are very often limited. In addition to the computational improvement, the analysis of predicted disease proteins indicates that the findings are beneficial in deciphering the pathogenic mechanisms.

For many mixtures, most methodological approaches fall significantly short of this goal. Existing solutions to this problem typically subdivide the task into two stages: first identifying a collection of peptides with a low false discovery rate and then inferring from the peptides a corresponding set of proteins. In contrast, we formulate the protein identification problem as a single optimization problem, which we solve using machine learning methods. This approach is motivated by the observation that the peptide and protein level tasks are cooperative, and the solution to each can be improved by using information about the solution to the other. The resulting algorithm directly controls the relevant error rate, can incorporate a wide variety of evidence and, for complex samples, provides 18-34% more protein identifications than the current state of the art approaches.

10.1016/j.aap.2011.04.011  |  None  |  Prognosis  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   The UK Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA) project produced a rich database with high-resolution data on driver behaviour covering a comprehensive range of road environment. The field trials provided vital information on driver behaviour in the presence of ISA. The purpose of this paper is to exploit the information gathered in the field trials to predict the impacts of various forms of ISA and to assess whether ISA is viable in terms of benefit-to-cost ratio. ISA is predicted to save up to 33% of accidents on urban roads, and to reduce CO(2) emissions by up to 5.8% on 70 mph roads. In order to investigate the long-term impacts of ISA, two hypothetical deployment scenarios were envisaged covering a 60-year appraisal period. The results indicate that ISA could deliver a very healthy benefit-to-cost ratio, ranging from 3.4 to 7.4, depending on the deployment scenarios. Under both deployment scenarios, ISA has recovered its implementation costs in less than 15 years. It can be concluded that implementation of ISA is clearly justified from a social cost and benefit perspective. Of the two deployment scenarios, the Market Driven one is substantially outperformed by the Authority Driven one. The benefits of ISA on fuel saving and emission reduction are real but not substantial, in comparison with the benefits on accident reduction; up to 98% of benefits are attributable to accident savings. Indeed, ISA is predicted to lead to a savings of 30% in fatal crashes and 25% in serious crashes over the 60-year period modelled.

However, to make the best use of robots, the behavior of the robot needs to be tailored to the learning objectives and personal characteristics of each unique individual with ASD. Currently training practices include adaptation of the training programs to the condition of each individual client, based on the particular learning goals or the mood of the client. To include robots in such training will imply that the trainers are enabled to control a robot through an intuitive interface. For this purpose we use a visual programming environment called TiViPE as an interface between robot and trainer, where scenarios for specific learning objectives can easily be put together as if they were graphical LEGO-like building blocks. This programming platform is linked to the NAO robot from Aldebaran Robotics. A process flow for converting trainers' scenarios was developed to make sure the gist of the original scenarios was kept intact. We give an example of how a scenario is processed, and implemented into the clinical setting, and how detailed parts of a scenario can be developed.

On average, it takes around 12 - 15 years and approximately €800 billion to bring a new drug to the market. Despite introduction of combinatorial chemistry and establishment of high-throughput screening (HTS), the number of new drug entities is limited. In fact, a number of established drug entities have been withdrawn from the market because of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). 
  Areas covered:  This review covers the advancements in cytochrome P450 (CYP450) modeling using different computational/machine learning (ML) tools over the past decade. A computational model for identifying non-toxic drug molecule from the pool of small chemical molecules is always welcome in the drug industry. Any computational tool that identifies the toxic molecule at early stage reduces the economic burden by slashing the number of molecules to be screened. This review covers all issues related to CYP-mediated toxicity such as specificity, inhibition, induction and regioselectivity. 
  Expert opinion:  Several computational methods for CYP-mediated toxicity are available, which are popular in computer-aided drug designing (CADD). These models may become helpful in toxicity prediction during early stages and can reduce high failure rates in preclinical and clinical trials. There is an urgent need to improve the accuracy, interpretability and confidence of the computation models used in drug discovery pathways.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.09.074  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis  |  K-Means-Like  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   In this paper, we present a semi-supervised clustering-based framework for discovering coherent subpopulations in heterogeneous image sets. Our approach involves limited supervision in the form of labeled instances from two distributions that reflect a rough guess about subspace of features that are relevant for cluster analysis. By assuming that images are defined in a common space via registration to a common template, we propose a segmentation-based method for detecting locations that signify local regional differences in the two labeled sets. A PCA model of local image appearance is then estimated at each location of interest, and ranked with respect to its relevance for clustering. We develop an incremental k-means-like algorithm that discovers novel meaningful categories in a test image set. The application of our approach in this paper is in analysis of populations of healthy older adults. We validate our approach on a synthetic dataset, as well as on a dataset of brain images of older adults. We assess our method's performance on the problem of discovering clusters of MR images of human brain, and present a cluster-based measure of pathology that reflects the deviation of a subject's MR image from normal (i.e. cognitively stable) state. We analyze the clusters' structure, and show that clustering results obtained using our approach correlate well with clinical data.

In this work we present a retrosynthetic approach to the production of therapeutics with the goal of developing an in situ drug delivery device in host cells. Retrosynthesis, a concept originally proposed for synthetic chemistry, iteratively applies reversed chemical transformations (reversed enzyme-catalyzed reactions in the metabolic space) starting from a target product to reach precursors that are endogenous to the chassis. So far, a wider adoption of retrosynthesis into the manufacturing pipeline has been hindered by the complexity of enumerating all feasible biosynthetic pathways for a given compound. 
  Results:  In our method, we efficiently address the complexity problem by coding substrates, products and reactions into molecular signatures. Metabolic maps are represented using hypergraphs and the complexity is controlled by varying the specificity of the molecular signature. Furthermore, our method enables candidate pathways to be ranked to determine which ones are best to engineer. The proposed ranking function can integrate data from different sources such as host compatibility for inserted genes, the estimation of steady-state fluxes from the genome-wide reconstruction of the organism's metabolism, or the estimation of metabolite toxicity from experimental assays. We use several machine-learning tools in order to estimate enzyme activity and reaction efficiency at each step of the identified pathways. Examples of production in bacteria and yeast for two antibiotics and for one antitumor agent, as well as for several essential metabolites are outlined. 
  Conclusions:  We present here a unified framework that integrates diverse techniques involved in the design of heterologous biosynthetic pathways through a retrosynthetic approach in the reaction signature space. Our engineering methodology enables the flexible design of industrial microorganisms for the efficient on-demand production of chemical compounds with therapeutic applications.

10.1089/dia.2010.0104  |  Treatment, Prognosis  |  Prognosis, Treatment  |  Feed-Forward Neural Network  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technologies report measurements of interstitial glucose concentration every 5 min. CGM technologies have the potential to be utilized for prediction of prospective glucose concentrations with subsequent optimization of glycemic control. This article outlines a feed-forward neural network model (NNM) utilized for real-time prediction of glucose. 
  Methods:  A feed-forward NNM was designed for real-time prediction of glucose in patients with diabetes implementing a prediction horizon of 75 min. Inputs to the NNM included CGM values, insulin dosages, metered glucose values, nutritional intake, lifestyle, and emotional factors. Performance of the NNM was assessed in 10 patients not included in the model training set. 
  Results:  The NNM had a root mean squared error of 43.9 mg/dL and a mean absolute difference percentage of 22.1. The NNM routinely overestimates hypoglycemic extremes, which can be attributed to the limited number of hypoglycemic reactions in the model training set. The model predicts 88.6% of normal glucose concentrations (&gt; 70 and &lt; 180 mg/dL), 72.6% of hyperglycemia (≥ 180 mg/dL), and 2.1% of hypoglycemia (≤ 70 mg/dL). Clarke Error Grid Analysis of model predictions indicated that 92.3% of predictions could be regarded as clinically acceptable and not leading to adverse therapeutic direction. Of these predicted values, 62.3% and 30.0% were located within Zones A and B, respectively, of the error grid. 
  Conclusions:  Real-time prediction of glucose via the proposed NNM may provide a means of intelligent therapeutic guidance and direction.

Four human subjects undergoing presurgical brain mapping and seizure foci localization participated in this study. Electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals were recorded while the subjects performed simple language tasks involving semantic information processing, such as a picture naming task where subjects named pictures of objects belonging to different semantic categories. Robust high-gamma band (60-120 Hz) activation was observed at the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) and the posterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) with a temporal sequence corresponding to speech production and perception. Furthermore, Gaussian Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine classifiers, two commonly used machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition, were able to predict the semantic category of an object using cortical activity captured by ECoG electrodes covering the frontal, temporal and parietal cortices. These findings have implications for both basic neuroscience research and development of semantic-based brain-computer interface systems (BCI) that can help individuals with severe motor or communication disorders to express their intention and thoughts.

10.1109/TNSRE.2010.2091429  |  Other  |  None, Other  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   The task of discriminating the neural pathways responsible for the activity recorded using a multi-contact nerve cuff electrode has recently been approached as an inverse problem of source localization, similar to EEG source localization. A major drawback of this method is that it requires a model of the nerve, and that the localization performance is highly dependent on the accuracy of this model. Using recordings from a 56-contact "matrix" cuff electrode placed on a rat sciatic nerve, we investigated a method that eliminates the need for a model, and uses instead an "experimental" leadfield constructed from a training set of experimental recordings. The resulting pathway-identification task is solved using an inverse problem framework. The experimental leadfield approach was able to identify the correct branch in cases in which a single fascicle was active with a success rate of 94.2%, but was not able to reliably identify combinations of fascicles. Nevertheless, the proposed methodology provides a framework for the study of multi-pathway discrimination, within which methods to improve performance can be investigated. Specifically, the influence of nerve anatomy and electrode design should be examined, and regularization approaches better suited to this novel inverse problem should be sought.

10.1117/1.3642010  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Glaucoma is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells and subsequent loss of visual function. Early detection of glaucoma is critical for the prevention of permanent structural damage and irreversible vision loss. Raman spectroscopy is a technique that provides rapid biochemical characterization of tissues in a nondestructive and noninvasive fashion. In this study, we explored the potential of using Raman spectroscopy for detection of glaucomatous changes in vitro. Raman spectroscopic imaging was conducted on retinal tissues of dogs with hereditary glaucoma and healthy control dogs. The Raman spectra were subjected to multivariate discriminant analysis with a support vector machine algorithm, and a classification model was developed to differentiate disease tissues versus healthy tissues. Spectroscopic analysis of 105 retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from glaucomatous dogs and 267 RGCs from healthy dogs revealed spectroscopic markers that differentiated glaucomatous specimens from healthy controls. Furthermore, the multivariate discriminant model differentiated healthy samples and glaucomatous samples with good accuracy [healthy 89.5% and glaucomatous 97.6% for the same breed (Basset Hounds); and healthy 85.0% and glaucomatous 85.5% for different breeds (Beagles versus Basset Hounds)]. Raman spectroscopic screening can be used for in vitro detection of glaucomatous changes in retinal tissue with a high specificity.

The new control strategy is based on a combination of the systematic triangularization technique and the robust neuro-sliding mode control approach. This strategy effectively copes with parameter uncertainties and external disturbances in real-time in order to achieve robustness and optimal performance of a multivariable system. This novel strategy reduces coupling effects on a multivariable system, eliminates chattering phenomena, and avoids the plant Jacobian calculation problem. Furthermore, the strategy can also achieve fast and global convergence using less computation. The effectiveness of the new multivariable control strategy is verified in real-time implementation on a powered wheelchair system. The obtained results confirm that robustness and desired performance of the overall system are guaranteed, even under parameter uncertainty and external disturbance effects.

10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2091-11.2011  |  Other  |  None, Other  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Currently, there are two opposing models for how voice and face information is integrated in the human brain to recognize person identity. The conventional model assumes that voice and face information is only combined at a supramodal stage (Bruce and Young, 1986; Burton et al., 1990; Ellis et al., 1997). An alternative model posits that areas encoding voice and face information also interact directly and that this direct interaction is behaviorally relevant for optimizing person recognition (von Kriegstein et al., 2005; von Kriegstein and Giraud, 2006). To disambiguate between the two different models, we tested for evidence of direct structural connections between voice- and face-processing cortical areas by combining functional and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. We localized, at the individual subject level, three voice-sensitive areas in anterior, middle, and posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) and face-sensitive areas in the fusiform gyrus [fusiform face area (FFA)]. Using probabilistic tractography, we show evidence that the FFA is structurally connected with voice-sensitive areas in STS. In particular, our results suggest that the FFA is more strongly connected to middle and anterior than to posterior areas of the voice-sensitive STS. This specific structural connectivity pattern indicates that direct links between face- and voice-recognition areas could be used to optimize human person recognition.

The degree of this disturbance is assumed to be associated with the disease severity [S. Schiermeier, D. Schäfer, T. Schäfer, W. Greulich, and M. E. Schläfke, "Breathing and locomotion in patients with Parkinson's disease," Eur. J. Physiol., vol. 443, No. 1, pp. 67-71, Jul. 2001]. To enable a long-term and online analysis of the locomotion-respiration coordination for scientific purpose, we have developed a distributed wireless communicating network. We aim to integrate biofeedback protocols with the real-time analysis of the locomotion-respiration coordination in the system to aid rehabilitation of PD patients. The network of sensor nodes is composed of intelligent network operating devices (iNODEs). The miniaturized iNODE contains a continuous data acquisition system based on microcontroller, local data storage, capability of on-sensor digital signal processing in real time, and wireless communication based on IEEE 802.15.4. Force sensing resistors and respiratory inductive plethysmography are applied for motion and respiration sensing, respectively. A number of experiments have been undertaken in clinic and laboratory to test the system. It shall facilitate identification of therapeutic effects on PD, allowing to measure the patients' health status, and to aid in the rehabilitation of PD patients.

Thus, novel operating rooms have been designed to augment traditional surgical equipment with advanced imaging systems to guide the procedures. We propose a novel method to fuse pre-operative and intra-operative information by jointly estimating anatomical models from multiple image modalities. Thereby high-quality patient-specific models are integrated into the imaging environment of operating rooms to guide cardiac interventions. Robust and fast machine learning techniques are utilized to guide the estimation process. Our method integrates both the redundant and complementary multimodal information to achieve a comprehensive modeling and simultaneously reduce the estimation uncertainty. Experiments performed on 28 patients with pairs of multimodal volumetric data are used to demonstrate high quality intra-operative patient-specific modeling of the aortic valve with a precision of 1.09mm in TEE and 1.73mm in 3D C-arm CT. Within a processing time of 10 seconds we additionally obtain model sensitive mapping between the pre- and intraoperative images.

10.1186/1471-2105-12-424  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Supervised classifiers for digital pathology can improve the ability of physicians to detect and diagnose diseases such as cancer. Generating training data for classifiers is problematic, since only domain experts (e.g. pathologists) can correctly label ground truth data. Additionally, digital pathology datasets suffer from the "minority class problem", an issue where the number of exemplars from the non-target class outnumber target class exemplars which can bias the classifier and reduce accuracy. In this paper, we develop a training strategy combining active learning (AL) with class-balancing. AL identifies unlabeled samples that are "informative" (i.e. likely to increase classifier performance) for annotation, avoiding non-informative samples. This yields high accuracy with a smaller training set size compared with random learning (RL). Previous AL methods have not explicitly accounted for the minority class problem in biomedical images. Pre-specifying a target class ratio mitigates the problem of training bias. Finally, we develop a mathematical model to predict the number of annotations (cost) required to achieve balanced training classes. In addition to predicting training cost, the model reveals the theoretical properties of AL in the context of the minority class problem. 
  Results:  Using this class-balanced AL training strategy (CBAL), we build a classifier to distinguish cancer from non-cancer regions on digitized prostate histopathology. Our dataset consists of 12,000 image regions sampled from 100 biopsies (58 prostate cancer patients). We compare CBAL against: (1) unbalanced AL (UBAL), which uses AL but ignores class ratio; (2) class-balanced RL (CBRL), which uses RL with a specific class ratio; and (3) unbalanced RL (UBRL). The CBAL-trained classifier yields 2% greater accuracy and 3% higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) than alternatively-trained classifiers. Our cost model accurately predicts the number of annotations necessary to obtain balanced classes. The accuracy of our prediction is verified by empirically-observed costs. Finally, we find that over-sampling the minority class yields a marginal improvement in classifier accuracy but the improved performance comes at the expense of greater annotation cost. 
  Conclusions:  We have combined AL with class balancing to yield a general training strategy applicable to most supervised classification problems where the dataset is expensive to obtain and which suffers from the minority class problem. An intelligent training strategy is a critical component of supervised classification, but the integration of AL and intelligent choice of class ratios, as well as the application of a general cost model, will help researchers to plan the training process more quickly and effectively.

10.1093/rpd/ncq530  |  Prognosis, Treatment  |  None, Other  |  Support Vector Machine  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Irradiation of individual cultured mammalian cells with a pre-selected number of ions down to one ion per single cell is a useful experimental approach to investigating the low-dose ionising radiation exposure effects and thus contributing to a more realistic human cancer risk assessment. One of the crucial tasks of all the microbeam apparatuses is the visualisation, recognition and positioning of every individual cell of the cell culture to be irradiated. Before irradiations, mammalian cells (specifically, Chinese hamster V79 cells) are seeded and grown as a monolayer on a mylar surface used as the bottom of a specially designed holder. Manual recognition of unstained cells in a bright-field microscope is a time-consuming procedure; therefore, a parallel algorithm has been conceived and developed in order to speed up this irradiation protocol step. Many technical problems have been faced to overcome the complexity of the images to be analysed: cell discrimination in an inhomogeneous background, among many disturbing bodies mainly due to the mylar surface roughness and culture medium bodies; cell shapes, depending on how they attach to the surface, which phase of the cell cycle they are in and on cell density. Preliminary results of the recognition and classification based on a method of wavelet kernels for the support vector machine classifier will be presented.

10.1109/TIP.2011.2172800  |  None  |  Diagnosis, Drug Discovery, Treatment  |  Bayesian Regression  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   An approach to the problem of estimating the size of inhomogeneous crowds, which are composed of pedestrians that travel in different directions, without using explicit object segmentation or tracking is proposed. Instead, the crowd is segmented into components of homogeneous motion, using the mixture of dynamic-texture motion model. A set of holistic low-level features is extracted from each segmented region, and a function that maps features into estimates of the number of people per segment is learned with Bayesian regression. Two Bayesian regression models are examined. The first is a combination of Gaussian process regression with a compound kernel, which accounts for both the global and local trends of the count mapping but is limited by the real-valued outputs that do not match the discrete counts. We address this limitation with a second model, which is based on a Bayesian treatment of Poisson regression that introduces a prior distribution on the linear weights of the model. Since exact inference is analytically intractable, a closed-form approximation is derived that is computationally efficient and kernelizable, enabling the representation of nonlinear functions. An approximate marginal likelihood is also derived for kernel hyperparameter learning. The two regression-based crowd counting methods are evaluated on a large pedestrian data set, containing very distinct camera views, pedestrian traffic, and outliers, such as bikes or skateboarders. Experimental results show that regression-based counts are accurate regardless of the crowd size, outperforming the count estimates produced by state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors. Results on 2 h of video demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the regression-based crowd size estimation over long periods of time.

This system has two main branches. The former consists of selecting the feature set which best defines the UI type from the set of features (age, weight, etc.) characterizing a patient. This feature set is computed from several scoring measures. The patients characterized by the optimum feature set are then classified according to C4.5 and SVM classifiers. The results are evaluated according to Sensitivity and Specificity evaluation measures. The management of the final system is simple and its performance is high, getting Sensitivities over 80% and Specificities near 100% for some configurations.

10.1016/j.cmpb.2011.06.007  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis, Treatment  |  Naïve Bayes  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most important complications of diabetes mellitus, which causes serious damages in the retina, consequently visual loss and sometimes blindness if necessary medical treatment is not applied on time. One of the difficulties in this illness is that the patient with diabetes mellitus requires a continuous screening for early detection. So far, numerous methods have been proposed by researchers to automate the detection process of DR in retinal fundus images. In this paper, we developed an alternative simple approach to detect DR. This method was built on the inverse segmentation method, which we suggested before to detect Age Related Macular Degeneration (ARMDs). Background image approach along with inverse segmentation is employed to measure and follow up the degenerations in retinal fundus images. Direct segmentation techniques generate unsatisfactory results in some cases. This is because of the fact that the texture of unhealthy areas such as DR is not homogenous. The inverse method is proposed to exploit the homogeneity of healthy areas rather than dealing with varying structure of unhealthy areas for segmenting bright lesions (hard exudates and cotton wool spots). On the other hand, the background image, dividing the retinal image into high and low intensity areas, is exploited in segmentation of hard exudates and cotton wool spots, and microaneurysms (MAs) and hemorrhages (HEMs), separately. Therefore, a complete segmentation system is developed for segmenting DR, including hard exudates, cotton wool spots, MAs, and HEMs. This application is able to measure total changes across the whole retinal image. Hence, retinal images that belong to the same patients are examined in order to monitor the trend of the illness. To make a comparison with other methods, a Naïve Bayes method is applied for segmentation of DR. The performance of the system, tested on different data sets including various qualities of retinal fundus images, is over 95% in detection of the optic disc (OD), and 90% in segmentation of the DR.

10.1093/schbul/sbr145  |  Prognosis  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis  |  Multivariate Machine Learning  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Reliable prognostic biomarkers are needed for the early recognition of psychosis. Recently, multivariate machine learning methods have demonstrated the feasibility to predict illness onset in clinically defined at-risk individuals using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. However, it remains unclear whether these findings could be replicated in independent populations. 
  Methods:  We evaluated the performance of an MRI-based classification system in predicting disease conversion in at-risk individuals recruited within the prospective FePsy (Früherkennung von Psychosen) study at the University of Basel, Switzerland. Pairwise and multigroup biomarkers were constructed using the MRI data of 22 healthy volunteers, 16/21 at-risk subjects with/without a subsequent disease conversion. Diagnostic performance was measured in unseen test cases using repeated nested cross-validation. 
  Results:  The classification accuracies in the "healthy controls (HCs) vs converters," "HCs vs nonconverters," and "converters vs nonconverters" analyses were 92.3%, 66.9%, and 84.2%, respectively. A positive likelihood ratio of 6.5 in the converters vs nonconverters analysis indicated a 40% increase in diagnostic certainty by applying the biomarker to an at-risk population with a transition rate of 43%. The neuroanatomical decision functions underlying these results particularly involved the prefrontal perisylvian and subcortical brain structures. 
  Conclusions:  Our findings suggest that the early prediction of psychosis may be reliably enhanced using neuroanatomical pattern recognition operating at the single-subject level. These MRI-based biomarkers may have the potential to identify individuals at the highest risk of developing psychosis, and thus may promote informed clinical strategies aiming at preventing the full manifestation of the disease.

The conventional criterion (≥2 μmho rise/30 s) for classifying hot flashes physiologically has shown poor performance. We improved this performance in the laboratory with Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a pattern classification method. We aimed to compare conventional to SVM methods to classify hot flashes in the ambulatory setting. Thirty-one women with hot flashes underwent 24 h of ambulatory sternal skin conductance monitoring. Hot flashes were quantified with conventional (≥2 μmho/30 s) and SVM methods. Conventional methods had low sensitivity (sensitivity=.57, specificity=.98, positive predictive value (PPV)=.91, negative predictive value (NPV)=.90, F1=.60), with performance lower with higher body mass index (BMI). SVMs improved this performance (sensitivity=.87, specificity=.97, PPV=.90, NPV=.96, F1=.88) and reduced BMI variation. SVMs can improve ambulatory physiologic hot flash measures.

The nonparametric representation promotes simple modeling of nested branches and n -way furcations, i.e., structures that abound in an arterial network, e.g., a cerebrovascular circulation. Our method is capable of extracting the entire vascular tree from an angiogram in a single execution with a proper initialization. A succinct initial model from the user with arterial network inlets, outlets, and branching points is sufficient for complex vasculature. The novel method is based upon the theory of principal curves. In this paper, theoretical extension to grayscale angiography is discussed, and an algorithm to find an arterial network as principal curves is also described. Quantitative validation on a number of simulated data sets, synthetic volumes of 19 BrainWeb vascular models, and 32 Rotterdam Coronary Artery volumes was conducted. We compared the algorithm to a state-of-the-art method and further tested it on two clinical data sets. Our algorithmic outputs-lumen centers and flow channel widths-are important to various medical and clinical applications, e.g., vasculature segmentation, registration and visualization, virtual angioscopy, and vascular atlas formation and population study.

10.1162/EVCO_a_00048  |  Robotics  |  Robotics, Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Review  |   Evolutionary robotics (ER) aims at automatically designing robots or controllers of robots without having to describe their inner workings. To reach this goal, ER researchers primarily employ phenotypes that can lead to an infinite number of robot behaviors and fitness functions that only reward the achievement of the task-and not how to achieve it. These choices make ER particularly prone to premature convergence. To tackle this problem, several papers recently proposed to explicitly encourage the diversity of the robot behaviors, rather than the diversity of the genotypes as in classic evolutionary optimization. Such an approach avoids the need to compute distances between structures and the pitfalls of the noninjectivity of the phenotype/behavior relation; however, it also introduces new questions: how to compare behavior? should this comparison be task specific? and what is the best way to encourage diversity in this context? In this paper, we review the main published approaches to behavioral diversity and benchmark them in a common framework. We compare each approach on three different tasks and two different genotypes. The results show that fostering behavioral diversity substantially improves the evolutionary process in the investigated experiments, regardless of genotype or task. Among the benchmarked approaches, multi-objective methods were the most efficient and the generic, Hamming-based, behavioral distance was at least as efficient as task specific behavioral metrics.

However, diagnostic image analysis performed by automated systems is to date quite rare. 
  Objectives:  In this study, we investigated the applicability of an automated image analysis system using a machine learning algorithm on diagnostic discrimination of benign and malignant melanocytic skin tumours in RCM. 
  Methods:  Overall, 16,269 RCM tumour images were evaluated. Image analysis was based on features of the wavelet transform. A learning set of 6147 images was used to establish a classification tree algorithm and an independent test set of 10, 122 images was applied to validate the tree model (grouping method 1). Additionally, randomly generated 'new' learning and test sets, tumour images only and different skin layers were evaluated (grouping method 2, 3 and 4). 
  Results:  The classification tree analysis correctly classified 93.60% of the melanoma and 90.40% of the nevi images of the learning set. When the classification tree was applied to the independent test set 46.71 ± 19.97% (range 7.81-83.87%) of the tumour images in benign melanocytic skin lesions were classified as 'malignant', in contrast to 55.68 ± 14.58% (range 30.65-83.59%; t-test: P &lt; 0.036) in malignant melanocytic skin lesions (grouping method 1). Further investigations could not improve the results significantly (grouping method 2, 3 and 4). 
  Conclusions:  The automated RCM image analysis procedure holds promise for further investigations. However, to date our system cannot be applied to routine skin tumour screening.

The authors' goal is to improve these methods by using information about the topic of the document in which the ambiguous term appears. 
  Design:  The authors proposed and implemented several methods to extract lists of key terms associated with Medical Subject Heading terms. These key terms are used to represent the document topic in a knowledge-based WSD system. They are applied both alone and in combination with local context. 
  Measurements:  A standard measure of accuracy was calculated over the set of target words in the widely used National Library of Medicine WSD dataset. 
  Results and discussion:  The authors report a significant improvement when combining those key terms with local context, showing that domain information improves the results of a WSD system based on the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus alone. The best results were obtained using key terms obtained by relevance feedback and weighted by inverse document frequency.

10.1109/TBME.2010.2093576  |  Other  |  None, Other  |  Markov Random Field  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   In this paper, we propose a Markov random field-based method that uses saliency and gradient information for elastic registration of dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance (MR) images of the heart. DCE-MR images are characterized by rapid intensity changes over time, thus posing challenges for conventional intensity-based registration methods. Saliency information contributes to a contrast invariant metric to identify similar regions in spite of contrast enhancement. Its robustness and accuracy are attributed to a close adherence to a neurobiological model of the human visual system (HVS). The HVS has a remarkable ability to match images in the face of intensity changes and noise. This ability motivated us to explore the efficacy of such a model for registering DCE-MR images. The data penalty is a combination of saliency and gradient information. The smoothness cost depends upon the relative displacement and saliency difference of neighboring pixels. Saliency is also used in a modified narrow band graph cut framework to identify relevant pixels for registration, thus reducing the number of graph nodes and computation time. Experimental results on real patient images demonstrate superior registration accuracy for a combination of saliency and gradient information over other similarity metrics.

10.1109/TBME.2011.2119484  |  Diagnosis  |  Prognosis  |  Linear Multiregression Analysis  ,  Support Vector Regression  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Whole knee joint MR image datasets were used to compare the performance of geometric trabecular bone features and advanced machine learning techniques in predicting biomechanical strength properties measured on the corresponding ex vivo specimens. Changes of trabecular bone structure throughout the proximal tibia are indicative of several musculoskeletal disorders involving changes in the bone quality and the surrounding soft tissue. Recent studies have shown that MR imaging also allows non-invasive 3-D characterization of bone microstructure. Sophisticated features like the scaling index method (SIM) can estimate local structural and geometric properties of the trabecular bone and may improve the ability of MR imaging to determine local bone quality in vivo. A set of 67 bone cubes was extracted from knee specimens and their biomechanical strength estimated by the yield stress (YS) [in MPa] was determined through mechanical testing. The regional apparent bone volume fraction (BVF) and SIM derived features were calculated for each bone cube. A linear multiregression analysis (MultiReg) and a optimized support vector regression (SVR) algorithm were used to predict the YS from the image features. The prediction accuracy was measured by the root mean square error (RMSE) for each image feature on independent test sets. The best prediction result with the lowest prediction error of RMSE = 1.021 MPa was obtained with a combination of BVF and SIM features and by using SVR. The prediction accuracy with only SIM features and SVR (RMSE = 1.023 MPa) was still significantly better than BVF alone and MultiReg (RMSE = 1.073 MPa). The current study demonstrates that the combination of sophisticated bone structure features and supervised learning techniques can improve MR-based determination of trabecular bone quality.

10.1371/journal.pbio.1000615  |  Robotics, Genetics  |  Prognosis, Robotics, Genetics  |  Hamilton's Rule  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   The evolution of altruism is a fundamental and enduring puzzle in biology. In a seminal paper Hamilton showed that altruism can be selected for when rb - c &gt; 0, where c is the fitness cost to the altruist, b is the fitness benefit to the beneficiary, and r is their genetic relatedness. While many studies have provided qualitative support for Hamilton's rule, quantitative tests have not yet been possible due to the difficulty of quantifying the costs and benefits of helping acts. Here we use a simulated system of foraging robots to experimentally manipulate the costs and benefits of helping and determine the conditions under which altruism evolves. By conducting experimental evolution over hundreds of generations of selection in populations with different c/b ratios, we show that Hamilton's rule always accurately predicts the minimum relatedness necessary for altruism to evolve. This high accuracy is remarkable given the presence of pleiotropic and epistatic effects as well as mutations with strong effects on behavior and fitness (effects not directly taken into account in Hamilton's original 1964 rule). In addition to providing the first quantitative test of Hamilton's rule in a system with a complex mapping between genotype and phenotype, these experiments demonstrate the wide applicability of kin selection theory.

10.1016/j.ridd.2011.07.004  |  Diagnosis, Treatment  |  Treatment  |  Bayesian Network  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Three-dimensional gait analysis (3DGA) generates a wealth of highly variable data. Gait classifications help to reduce, simplify and interpret this vast amount of 3DGA data and thereby assist and facilitate clinical decision making in the treatment of CP. CP gait is often a mix of several clinically accepted distinct gait patterns. Therefore, there is a need for a classification which characterizes each CP gait by different degrees of membership for several gait patterns, which are considered by clinical experts to be highly relevant. In this respect, this paper introduces Bayesian networks (BN) as a new approach for classification of 3DGA data of the ankle and knee in children with CP. A BN is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph. Furthermore, they provide an explicit way of introducing clinical expertise as prior knowledge to guide the BN in its analysis of the data and the underlying clinically relevant relationships. BNs also enable to classify gait on a continuum of patterns, as their outcome consists of a set of probabilistic membership values for different clinically accepted patterns. A group of 139 patients with CP was recruited and divided into a training- (n=80% of all patients) and a validation-dataset (n=20% of all patients). An average classification accuracy of 88.4% was reached. The BN of this study achieved promising accuracy rates and was found to be successful for classifying ankle and knee joint motion on a continuum of different clinically relevant gait patterns.

10.1002/mrm.22584  |  Other  |  None, Other  |  Bayesian Method  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Among recent parallel MR imaging reconstruction advances, a Bayesian method called Edge-preserving Parallel Imaging reconstructions with GRAph cuts Minimization (EPIGRAM) has been demonstrated to significantly improve signal-to-noise ratio when compared with conventional regularized sensitivity encoding method. However, EPIGRAM requires a large number of iterations in proportion to the number of intensity labels in the image, making it computationally expensive for high dynamic range images. The objective of this study is to develop a Fast EPIGRAM reconstruction based on the efficient binary jump move algorithm that provides a logarithmic reduction in reconstruction time while maintaining image quality. Preliminary in vivo validation of the proposed algorithm is presented for two-dimensional cardiac cine MR imaging and three-dimensional coronary MR angiography at acceleration factors of 2-4. Fast EPIGRAM was found to provide similar image quality to EPIGRAM and maintain the previously reported signal-to-noise ratio improvement over regularized sensitivity encoding method, while reducing EPIGRAM reconstruction time by 25-50 times.

10.1109/TMI.2010.2091513  |  Other  |  None, Other  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   A general approach to the first-order analysis of error in rigid point registration is presented that accommodates fiducial localization error (FLE) that may be inhomogeneous (varying from point to point) and anisotropic (varying with direction) and also accommodates arbitrary weighting that may also be inhomogeneous and anisotropic. Covariances are derived for target registration error (TRE) and for weighted fiducial registration error (FRE) in terms of covariances of FLE, culminating in a simple implementation that encompasses all combinations of weightings and anisotropy. Furthermore, it is shown that for ideal weighting, in which the weighting matrix for each fiducial equals the inverse of the square root of the cross covariance of its two-space FLE, fluctuations of FRE and TRE are mutually independent. These results are validated by comparison with previously published expressions and by simulation. Furthermore, simulations for randomly generated fiducial positions and FLEs are presented that show that correlation is negligible (correlation coefficient &lt; 0.1) in the exact case for both ideal and uniform weighting (i.e., no weighting), the latter of which is employed in commercial surgical guidance systems. From these results we conclude that for these weighting schemes, while valid expressions exist relating the covariance of FRE to the covariance of TRE, there are no measures of the goodness of fit of the fiducials for a given registration that give to first order any information about the fluctuation of TRE from its expected value and none that give useful information in the exact case. Therefore, as estimators of registration accuracy, such measures should be approached with extreme caution both by the purveyors of guidance systems and by the practitioners who use them.

10.1007/s11548-011-0645-6  |  Robotics, Treatment  |  Prognosis, Treatment  |  Sequential Monte Carlo Simulation  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Purpose:  Accurate and robust estimates of camera position and orientation in a bronchoscope are required for navigation. Fusion of pre-interventional information (e.g., CT, MRI, or US) and intra-interventional information (e.g., bronchoscopic video) were incorporated into a navigation system to provide physicians with an augmented reality environment for bronchoscopic interventions. 
  Methods:  Two approaches were used to predict bronchoscope movements by incorporating sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) simulation including (1) image-based tracking techniques and (2) electromagnetic tracking (EMT) methods. SMC simulation was introduced to model ambiguities or uncertainties that occurred in image- and EMT-based bronchoscope tracking. Scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) features were employed to overcome the limitations of image-based motion tracking methods. Validation was performed on five phantom and ten human case datasets acquired in the supine position. 
  Results:  For dynamic phantom validation, the EMT-SMC simulation method improved the tracking performance of the successfully registered bronchoscopic video frames by 12.7% compared with a hybrid-based method. In comparisons between tracking results and ground truth, the accuracy of the EMT-SMC simulation method was 1.51 mm (positional error) and 5.44° (orientation error). During patient assessment, the SIFT-SMC simulation scheme was more stable or robust than a previous image-based approach for bronchoscope motion estimation, showing 23.6% improvement of successfully tracked frames. Comparing the estimates of our method to ground truth, the position and orientation errors are 3.72 mm and 10.2°, while those of our previous image-based method were at least 7.77 mm and 19.3°. The computational times of our EMT- and SIFT-SMC simulation methods were 0.9 and 1.2 s per frame, respectively. 
  Conclusion:  The SMC simulation method was developed to model ambiguities that occur in bronchoscope tracking. This method more stably and accurately predicts the bronchoscope camera position and orientation parameters, reducing uncertainties due to problematic bronchoscopic video frames and airway deformation during intra-bronchoscopy navigation.

10.1016/j.jbi.2011.01.004  |  Smart Healthcare  |  Treatment, Smart Healthcare  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Review  |    Objective:  Clinical questions are often long and complex and take many forms. We have built a clinical question answering system named AskHERMES to perform robust semantic analysis on complex clinical questions and output question-focused extractive summaries as answers. 
  Design:  This paper describes the system architecture and a preliminary evaluation of AskHERMES, which implements innovative approaches in question analysis, summarization, and answer presentation. Five types of resources were indexed in this system: MEDLINE abstracts, PubMed Central full-text articles, eMedicine documents, clinical guidelines and Wikipedia articles. 
  Measurement:  We compared the AskHERMES system with Google (Google and Google Scholar) and UpToDate and asked physicians to score the three systems by ease of use, quality of answer, time spent, and overall performance. 
  Results:  AskHERMES allows physicians to enter a question in a natural way with minimal query formulation and allows physicians to efficiently navigate among all the answer sentences to quickly meet their information needs. In contrast, physicians need to formulate queries to search for information in Google and UpToDate. The development of the AskHERMES system is still at an early stage, and the knowledge resource is limited compared with Google or UpToDate. Nevertheless, the evaluation results show that AskHERMES' performance is comparable to the other systems. In particular, when answering complex clinical questions, it demonstrates the potential to outperform both Google and UpToDate systems. 
  Conclusions:  AskHERMES, available at http://www.AskHERMES.org, has the potential to help physicians practice evidence-based medicine and improve the quality of patient care.

10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2011.02.008  |  Other  |  None, Other  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  As the volume of biomedical text increases exponentially, automatic indexing becomes increasingly important. However, existing approaches do not distinguish central (or core) concepts from concepts that were mentioned in passing. We focus on the problem of indexing MEDLINE records, a process that is currently performed by highly trained humans at the National Library of Medicine (NLM). NLM indexers are assisted by a system called the Medical Text Indexer (MTI) that suggests candidate indexing terms. 
  Objective:  To improve the ability of MTI to select the core terms in MEDLINE abstracts. These core concepts are deemed to be most important and are designated as "major headings" by MEDLINE indexers. We introduce and evaluate a graph-based indexing methodology called MEDRank that generates concept graphs from biomedical text and then ranks the concepts within these graphs to identify the most important ones. 
  Methods:  We insert a MEDRank step into the MTI and compare MTI's output with and without MEDRank to the MEDLINE indexers' selected terms for a sample of 11,803 PubMed Central articles. We also tested whether human raters prefer terms generated by the MEDLINE indexers, MTI without MEDRank, and MTI with MEDRank for a sample of 36 PubMed Central articles. 
  Results:  MEDRank improved recall of major headings designated by 30% over MTI without MEDRank (0.489 vs. 0.376). Overall recall was only slightly (6.5%) higher (0.490 vs. 0.460) as was F(2) (3%, 0.408 vs. 0.396). However, overall precision was 3.9% lower (0.268 vs. 0.279). Human raters preferred terms generated by MTI with MEDRank over terms generated by MTI without MEDRank (by an average of 1.00 more term per article), and preferred terms generated by MTI with MEDRank and the MEDLINE indexers at the same rate. 
  Conclusions:  The addition of MEDRank to MTI significantly improved the retrieval of core concepts in MEDLINE abstracts and more closely matched human expectations compared to MTI without MEDRank. In addition, MEDRank slightly improved overall recall and F(2).

10.1016/j.plaphy.2011.01.002  |  Genetics  |  Prognosis, Genetics  |  Support Vector Machine  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Identification of regulatory relationships between transcription factors (TFs) and their targets is a central problem in post-genomic biology. In this paper, we apply an approach based on the support vector machine (SVM) and gene-expression data to predict the regulatory interactions in Arabidopsis. A set of 125 experimentally validated TF-target interactions and 750 negative regulatory gene pairs are collected as the training data. Their expression profiles data at 79 experimental conditions are fed to the SVM to perform the prediction. Through the jackknife cross-validation test, we find that the overall prediction accuracy of our approach achieves 88.68%. Our approach could help to widen the understanding of Arabidopsis gene regulatory scheme and may offer a cost-effective alternative to construct the gene regulatory network.

10.1109/TCBB.2009.48  |  Genetics  |  Prognosis, Genetics  |  Bayesian Analysis  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Recent experimental advances facilitate the collection of time series data that indicate which genes in a cell are expressed. This information can be used to understand the genetic regulatory network that generates the data. Typically, Bayesian analysis approaches are applied which neglect the time series nature of the experimental data, have difficulty in determining the direction of causality, and do not perform well on networks with tight feedback. To address these problems, this paper presents a method to learn genetic network connectivity which exploits the time series nature of experimental data to achieve better causal predictions. This method first breaks up the data into bins. Next, it determines an initial set of potential influence vectors for each gene based upon the probability of the gene's expression increasing in the next time step. These vectors are then combined to form new vectors with better scores. Finally, these influence vectors are competed against each other to determine the final influence vector for each gene. The result is a directed graph representation of the genetic network's repression and activation connections. Results are reported for several synthetic networks with tight feedback showing significant improvements in recall and runtime over Yu's dynamic Bayesian approach. Promising preliminary results are also reported for an analysis of experimental data for genes involved in the yeast cell cycle.

10.1109/TITB.2011.2107916  |  Diagnosis  |  None, Other  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Posture analysis in quiet standing is a key component of the clinical evaluation of Parkinson's disease (PD), postural instability being one of PD's major symptoms. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of using accelerometers to characterize the postural behavior of early mild PD subjects. Twenty PD and 20 control subjects, wearing an accelerometer on the lower back, were tested in five conditions characterized by sensory and attentional perturbation. A total of 175 measures were computed from the signals to quantify tremor, acceleration, and displacement of body sway. Feature selection was implemented to identify the subsets of measures that better characterize the distinctive behavior of PD and control subjects. It was based on different classifiers and on a nested cross validation, to maximize robustness of selection with respect to changes in the training set. Several subsets of three features achieved misclassification rates as low as 5%. Many of them included a tremor-related measure, a postural measure in the frequency domain, and a postural displacement measure. Results suggest that quantitative posture analysis using a single accelerometer and a simple test protocol may provide useful information to characterize early PD subjects. This protocol is potentially usable to monitor the disease's progression.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.03.027  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis, Smart Healthcare  |  Unsupervised Multiparametric Clustering  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Characterization and quantification of magnetic resonance perfusion images is important for clinical interpretation, though this calls for a reproducible and accurate method of analysis and a robust healthy reference. The few studies which have examined the perfusion of the healthy brain using dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) imaging were largely limited to manual definition of the regions of interest (ROI) and results were dependent on the location of the ROI. The current study aimed to develop a methodology for DSC data analysis and to obtain reference values of healthy subjects. Twenty three healthy volunteers underwent DSC. An unsupervised multiparametric clustering method was applied to four perfusion parameters. Three clusters were defined and identified as: dura-blood-vessels, gray matter and white matter and their vascular characteristics were obtained. Additionally, regional perfusion differences were studied and revealed a prolonged mean transient time and a trend for higher vascularity in the posterior compared with the anterior and middle cerebral vascular territories. While additional studies are required to confirm our findings, this result may have important clinical implications. The proposed unsupervised multiparametric method enabled accurate tissue differentiation, is easy replicable and has a wide range of applications in both pathological and healthy brains.

10.1109/TIP.2010.2076820  |  None  |  None, Other  |  Gaussian Process Regression  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Human pose estimation via motion tracking systems can be considered as a regression problem within a discriminative framework. It is always a challenging task to model the mapping from observation space to state space because of the high-dimensional characteristic in the multimodal conditional distribution. In order to build the mapping, existing techniques usually involve a large set of training samples in the learning process which are limited in their capability to deal with multimodality. We propose, in this work, a novel online sparse Gaussian Process (GP) regression model to recover 3-D human motion in monocular videos. Particularly, we investigate the fact that for a given test input, its output is mainly determined by the training samples potentially residing in its local neighborhood and defined in the unified input-output space. This leads to a local mixture GP experts system composed of different local GP experts, each of which dominates a mapping behavior with the specific covariance function adapting to a local region. To handle the multimodality, we combine both temporal and spatial information therefore to obtain two categories of local experts. The temporal and spatial experts are integrated into a seamless hybrid system, which is automatically self-initialized and robust for visual tracking of nonlinear human motion. Learning and inference are extremely efficient as all the local experts are defined online within very small neighborhoods. Extensive experiments on two real-world databases, HumanEva and PEAR, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model, which significantly improve the performance of existing models.

10.1016/j.media.2011.11.008  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Respiratory motion is a challenging factor for image acquisition and image-guided procedures in the abdominal and thoracic region. In order to address the issues arising from respiratory motion, it is often necessary to detect the respiratory signal. In this article, we propose a novel, purely image-based retrospective respiratory gating method for ultrasound and MRI. Further, we apply this technique to acquire breathing-affected 4D ultrasound with a wobbler probe and, similarly, to create 4D MR with a slice stacking approach. We achieve the gating with Laplacian eigenmaps, a manifold learning technique, to determine the low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional image space. Since Laplacian eigenmaps assign to each image frame a coordinate in low-dimensional space by respecting the neighborhood relationship, they are well suited for analyzing the breathing cycle. We perform the image-based gating on several 2D and 3D ultrasound datasets over time, and quantify its very good performance by comparing it to measurements from an external gating system. For MRI, we perform the manifold learning on several datasets for various orientations and positions. We achieve very high correlations by a comparison to an alternative gating with diaphragm tracking.

These principles assume that the ISA equipment informs a driver of the speed limit, warns the driver when speeding and calculates penalty points. Each penalty point entails the reduction of a 30% discount on the driver's car insurance premium, which therefore produced the name, Pay as You Speed. The ISA equipment consists of a GPS-based On Board Unit with a mobile phone connection to a web server. The project was planned for a three-year test period with 300 young car drivers, but it never succeeded in recruiting that number of drivers. After several design changes, the project eventually went forward with 153 test drivers of all ages. This number represents approximately one thousandth of all car owners in the proving ground of North Jutland in Denmark. Furthermore the project was terminated before its scheduled closing date. This article describes the project with an emphasis on recruitment efforts and the project's progress. We include a discussion of possible explanations for the failure to recruit volunteers for the project and reflect upon the general barriers to using ISA with ordinary drivers.

10.1186/1471-2105-12-329  |  Diagnosis, Treatment  |  Diagnosis, Treatment  |  Machine Learning  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  BRENDA (BRaunschweig ENzyme DAtabase, http://www.brenda-enzymes.org) is a major resource for enzyme related information. First and foremost, it provides data which are manually curated from the primary literature. DRENDA (Disease RElated ENzyme information DAtabase) complements BRENDA with a focus on the automatic search and categorization of enzyme and disease related information from title and abstracts of primary publications. In a two-step procedure DRENDA makes use of text mining and machine learning methods. 
  Results:  Currently enzyme and disease related references are biannually updated as part of the standard BRENDA update. 910,897 relations of EC-numbers and diseases were extracted from titles or abstracts and are included in the second release in 2010. The enzyme and disease entity recognition has been successfully enhanced by a further relation classification via machine learning. The classification step has been evaluated by a 5-fold cross validation and achieves an F1 score between 0.802 ± 0.032 and 0.738 ± 0.033 depending on the categories and pre-processing procedures. In the eventual DRENDA content every category reaches a classification specificity of at least 96.7% and a precision that ranges from 86-98% in the highest confidence level, and 64-83% for the smallest confidence level associated with higher recall. 
  Conclusions:  The DRENDA processing chain analyses PubMed, locates references with disease-related information on enzymes and categorises their focus according to the categories causal interaction, therapeutic application, diagnostic usage and ongoing research. The categorisation gives an impression on the focus of the located references. Thus, the relation categorisation can facilitate orientation within the rapidly growing number of references with impact on diseases and enzymes. The DRENDA information is available as additional information in BRENDA.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btr204  |  Diagnosis, Genetics  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Genetics  |  Support Vector Machine  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Motivation:  Classifying biological data into different groups is a central task of bioinformatics: for instance, to predict the function of a gene or protein, the disease state of a patient or the phenotype of an individual based on its genotype. Support Vector Machines are a wide spread approach for classifying biological data, due to their high accuracy, their ability to deal with structured data such as strings, and the ease to integrate various types of data. However, it is unclear how to correct for confounding factors such as population structure, age or gender or experimental conditions in Support Vector Machine classification. 
  Results:  In this article, we present a Support Vector Machine classifier that can correct the prediction for observed confounding factors. This is achieved by minimizing the statistical dependence between the classifier and the confounding factors. We prove that this formulation can be transformed into a standard Support Vector Machine with rescaled input data. In our experiments, our confounder correcting SVM (ccSVM) improves tumor diagnosis based on samples from different labs, tuberculosis diagnosis in patients of varying age, ethnicity and gender, and phenotype prediction in the presence of population structure and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy.

Accordingly, we propose to learn genotype-phenotype functions, using Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) as the assumed functional form. In this study we develop DNF learning algorithms that attempt to construct predictors as Boolean combinations of covariates. We demonstrate the learning algorithm's consistency and efficiency on simulated sequences, and establish their biological relevance using a variety of real RNA virus datasets representing different viral phenotypes, including drug resistance, antigenicity, and pathogenicity. We compare our algorithms with previously published machine learning algorithms in terms of prediction quality: leave-one-out performance shows superior accuracy to other machine learning algorithms on the HIV drug resistance dataset and the UCIs promoter gene dataset. The algorithms are powerful in inferring the genotype-phenotype mapping from a moderate number of labeled sequences, as are typically produced in mutagenesis experiments. They can also greedily learn DNFs from large datasets. The Java implementation of our algorithms will be made publicly available.

This tool generates dose volume histograms (DVHs) of organs-at-risk (OARs) based on prior plans as a reference, to be compared with the adaptive plan derived from fluence map deformation. 
  Methods:  Under the same configuration using seven-field 15 MV photon beams, DVHs of OARs (bladder and rectum) were estimated based on anatomical information of the patient and a model learned from a database of high quality prior plans. In this study, the anatomical information was characterized by the organ volumes and distance-to-target histogram (DTH). The database consists of 198 high quality prostate plans and was validated with 14 cases outside the training pool. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to DVHs and DTHs to quantify their salient features. Then, support vector regression (SVR) was implemented to establish the correlation between the features of the DVH and the anatomical information. 
  Results:  DVH/DTH curves could be characterized sufficiently just using only two or three truncated principal components, thus, patient anatomical information was quantified with reduced numbers of variables. The evaluation of the model using the test data set demonstrated its accuracy approximately 80% in prediction and effectiveness in improving ART planning quality. 
  Conclusions:  An adaptive IMRT plan quality evaluation tool based on machine learning has been developed, which estimates OAR sparing and provides reference in evaluating ART.

Peripheral nerves and all cranial nerves, except for the olfactory tract, have previously been visualized. The olfactory tracts are difficult to depict with diffusion-weighted imaging due to the high sensitivity to susceptibility artifacts at the base of the skull. Here we report an optimized single-shot diffusion-weighted echo planar imaging sequence that can visualize the olfactory tracts with fiber tracking. Five healthy individuals were examined, and the olfactory tracts could be fiber tracked with the diffusion-weighted sequence. For comparison and as a negative control, an anosmic patient was examined. No olfactory tracts were visualized on T2-weighted nor diffusion-weighted fiber tracking images. Measuring diffusion in the olfactory tracts promise to facilitate the identification of different hyposmic and anosmic conditions.

Coupled with the recent (and ongoing) progress in high-throughput genotyping, sequencing and other genomic technologies, pharmacogenetics is rapidly transforming into pharmacogenomics, while pursuing the primary goals of identifying and studying the genetic contribution to drug therapy response and adverse effects, and existing drug characterization and new drug discovery. Accomplishment of both of these goals hinges on gaining a better understanding of the underlying biological systems; however, reverse-engineering biological system models from the massive datasets generated by the large-scale genetic epidemiology studies presents a formidable data analysis challenge. In this article, we review the recent progress made in developing such data analysis methodology within the paradigm of systems biology research that broadly aims to gain a 'holistic', or 'mechanistic' understanding of biological systems by attempting to capture the entirety of interactions between the components (genetic and otherwise) of the system.

10.1016/j.jaci.2011.02.039  |  Diagnosis, Genetics  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Genetics  |  Support Vector Machine  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a heterogeneous immune defect characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia, failure of specific antibody production, susceptibility to infections, and an array of comorbidities. 
  Objective:  To address the underlying immunopathogenesis of CVID and comorbidities, we conducted the first genome-wide association and gene copy number variation (CNV) study in patients with CVID. 
  Methods:  Three hundred sixty-three patients with CVID from 4 study sites were genotyped with 610,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Patients were divided into a discovery cohort of 179 cases in comparison with 1,917 control subjects and a replication cohort of 109 cases and 1,114 control subjects. 
  Results:  Our analyses detected strong association with the MHC region and association with a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) genes (P combined = 1.96 × 10(-7)) replicated in the independent cohort. CNV analysis defined 16 disease-associated deletions and duplications, including duplication of origin recognition complex 4L (ORC4L) that was unique to 15 cases (P = 8.66 × 10(-16)), as well as numerous unique rare intraexonic deletions and duplications suggesting multiple novel genetic causes of CVID. Furthermore, the 1,000 most significant SNPs were strongly predictive of the CVID phenotype by using a Support Vector Machine algorithm with positive and negative predictive values of 1.0 and 0.957, respectively. 
  Conclusion:  Our integrative genome-wide analysis of SNP genotypes and CNVs has uncovered multiple novel susceptibility loci for CVID, both common and rare, which is consistent with the highly heterogeneous nature of CVID. These results provide new mechanistic insights into immunopathogenesis based on these unique genetic variations and might allow for improved diagnosis of CVID based on accurate prediction of the CVID clinical phenotypes by using our Support Vector Machine model.

AFPs are present in vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, bacteria, fungi, etc. Although AFPs have a common function, they show a high degree of diversity in sequences and structures. Therefore, sequence similarity based search methods often fails to predict AFPs from sequence databases. In this work, we report a random forest approach "AFP-Pred" for the prediction of antifreeze proteins from protein sequence. AFP-Pred was trained on the dataset containing 300 AFPs and 300 non-AFPs and tested on the dataset containing 181 AFPs and 9193 non-AFPs. AFP-Pred achieved 81.33% accuracy from training and 83.38% from testing. The performance of AFP-Pred was compared with BLAST and HMM. High prediction accuracy and successful of prediction of hypothetical proteins suggests that AFP-Pred can be a useful approach to identify antifreeze proteins from sequence information, irrespective of their sequence similarity.

However, this examination is subject to a considerable amount of observer variability as it mainly relies on visual interpretation of pathologists. To alleviate this problem, it is very important to develop computational quantitative tools, for which image segmentation constitutes the core step. In this paper, we introduce an effective and robust algorithm for the segmentation of histopathological tissue images. This algorithm incorporates the background knowledge of the tissue organization into segmentation. For this purpose, it quantifies spatial relations of cytological tissue components by constructing a graph and uses this graph to define new texture features for image segmentation. This new texture definition makes use of the idea of gray-level run-length matrices. However, it considers the runs of cytological components on a graph to form a matrix, instead of considering the runs of pixel intensities. Working with colon tissue images, our experiments demonstrate that the texture features extracted from "graph run-length matrices" lead to high segmentation accuracies, also providing a reasonable number of segmented regions. Compared with four other segmentation algorithms, the results show that the proposed algorithm is more effective in histopathological image segmentation.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a promising AD biomarker but no single MRI feature is optimal for all disease stages. Machine Learning classification can address these challenges. In this study, we have investigated the classification of MRI features from AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and control subjects from ADNI with four techniques. The highest accuracy rates for the classification of controls against ADs and MCIs were 89.2% and 72.7%, respectively. Moreover, we used the classifiers to select AD and MCI subjects who are most likely to decline for inclusion in hypothetical CTs. Using the hippocampal volume as an outcome measure, we found that the required group sizes for the CTs were reduced from 197 to 117 AD patients and from 366 to 215 MCI subjects.

Often such applications require analysis of large image datasets for which manual segmentation becomes subjective and time consuming. Hence automation of the segmentation steps using fast, robust and accurate image analysis and pattern classification techniques is necessary for high throughput processing of such datasets. We describe a supervised learning framework, based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), to identify well-segmented nuclei in tissue sections from a multistage watershed segmentation algorithm. The successful automation was demonstrated by screening over 1400 well segmented nuclei from 9 datasets of human breast tissue section images and comparing the results to a previously used stacked classifier based analysis framework.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btr263  |  Genetics  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Genetics  |  Supervised Machine Learning  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Motivation:  Many ChIP-Seq experiments are aimed at developing gold standards for determining the locations of various genomic features such as transcription start or transcription factor binding sites on the whole genome. Many such pioneering experiments lack rigorous testing methods and adequate 'gold standard' annotations to compare against as they themselves are the most reliable source of empirical data available. To overcome this problem, we propose a self-consistency test whereby a dataset is tested against itself. It relies on a supervised machine learning style protocol for in silico annotation of a genome and accuracy estimation to guarantee, at least, self-consistency. 
  Results:  The main results use a novel performance metric (a calibrated precision) in order to assess and compare the robustness of the proposed supervised learning method across different test sets. As a proof of principle, we applied the whole protocol to two recent ChIP-Seq ENCODE datasets of STAT1 and Pol-II binding sites. STAT1 is benchmarked against in silicodetection of binding sites using available position weight matrices. Pol-II, the main focus of this paper, is benchmarked against 17 algorithms for the closely related and well-studied problem of in silico transcription start site (TSS) prediction. Our results also demonstrate the feasibility of in silico genome annotation extension with encouraging results from a small portion of annotated genome to the remainder.

Identification of miRNAs is crucial to understanding their biological mechanism. Recently, machine-learning approaches have been employed to predict miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs). However, features used are divergent and consequently induce different performance. Thus, feature selection is critical for pre-miRNA prediction. We generated an optimized feature subset including 13 features using a hybrid of genetic algorithm and support vector machine (GA-SVM). Based on SVM, the classification performance of the optimized feature subset is much higher than that of the two feature sets used in microPred and miPred by five-fold cross-validation. Finally, we constructed the classifier miR-SF to predict the most recently identified human pre-miRNAs in miRBase (version 16). Compared with microPred and miPred, miR-SF achieved much higher classification performance. Accuracies were 93.97%, 86.21% and 64.66% for miR-SF, microPred and miPred, respectively. Thus, miR-SF is effective for identifying pre-miRNAs.

10.1118/1.3562898  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis  |  Support Vector Regression  ,  Gaussian Process Regression  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Purpose:  A massive-training artificial neural network (MTANN) has been developed for the reduction of false positives (FPs) in computer-aided detection (CADe) of polyps in CT colonography (CTC). A major limitation of the MTANN is the long training time. To address this issue, the authors investigated the feasibility of two state-of-the-art regression models, namely, support vector regression (SVR) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) models, in the massive-training framework and developed massive-training SVR (MTSVR) and massive-training GPR (MTGPR) for the reduction of FPs in CADe of polyps. 
  Methods:  The authors applied SVR and GPR as volume-processing techniques in the distinction of polyps from FP detections in a CTC CADe scheme. Unlike artificial neural networks (ANNs), both SVR and GPR are memory-based methods that store a part of or the entire training data for testing. Therefore, their training is generally fast and they are able to improve the efficiency of the massive-training methodology. Rooted in a maximum margin property, SVR offers excellent generalization ability and robustness to outliers. On the other hand, GPR approaches nonlinear regression from a Bayesian perspective, which produces both the optimal estimated function and the covariance associated with the estimation. Therefore, both SVR and GPR, as the state-of-the-art nonlinear regression models, are able to offer a performance comparable or potentially superior to that of ANN, with highly efficient training. Both MTSVR and MTGPR were trained directly with voxel values from CTC images. A 3D scoring method based on a 3D Gaussian weighting function was applied to the outputs of MTSVR and MTGPR for distinction between polyps and nonpolyps. To test the performance of the proposed models, the authors compared them to the original MTANN in the distinction between actual polyps and various types of FPs in terms of training time reduction and FP reduction performance. The authors' CTC database consisted of 240 CTC data sets obtained from 120 patients in the supine and prone positions. The training set consisted of 27 patients, 10 of which had 10 polyps. The authors selected 10 nonpolyps (i.e., FP sources) from the training set. These ten polyps and ten nonpolyps were used for training the proposed models. The testing set consisted of 93 patients, including 19 polyps in 7 patients and 86 negative patients with 474 FPs produced by an original CADe scheme. 
  Results:  With the MTSVR, the training time was reduced by a factor of 190, while a FP reduction performance [by-polyp sensitivity of 94.7% (18/19) with 2.5 (230/93) FPs/patient] comparable to that of the original MTANN [the same sensitivity with 2.6 (244/93) FPs/patient] was achieved. The classification performance in terms of the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve value of the MTGPR (0.82) was statistically significantly higher than that of the original MTANN (0.77), with a two-sided p-value of 0.03. The MTGPR yielded a 94.7% (18/19) by-polyp sensitivity at a FP rate of 2.5 (235/93) per patient and reduced the training time by a factor of 1.3. 
  Conclusions:  Both MTSVR and MTGPR improve the efficiency of the training in the massive-training framework while maintaining a comparable performance.

10.1002/bip.21589  |  Genetics  |  Prognosis, Genetics  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   One of the major challenges in genomics is to understand the function of gene products from their 3D structures. Computational methods are needed for the high-throughput prediction of the function of proteins from their 3D structure. Methods that identify active sites are important for understanding and annotating the function of proteins. Traditional methods exploiting either sequence similarity or structural similarity can be unreliable and cannot be applied to proteins with novel folds or low homology with other proteins. Here, we present a machine-learning application that combines computed electrostatic, evolutionary, and pocket geometric information for high-performance prediction of catalytic residues. Input features consist of our structure-based theoretical microscopic anomalous titration curve shapes (THEMATICS) electrostatics data, enhanced with sequence-based phylogenetic information from INTREPID and topological pocket information from ConCavity. Our THEMATICS-based input features are augmented with an additional metric, the theoretical buffer range. With the integration of the three different types of input, each of which performs admirably on its own, significantly better performance is achieved than that of any of these methods by itself. This combined method achieves 86.7%, 92.5%, and 93.8% recall of annotated functional residues at 5, 8, and 10% false-positive rates, respectively.

10.1371/journal.pone.0028507  |  Genetics  |  Prognosis, Genetics  |  Logistic Regression  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Review  |   Temperature-sensitive (TS) mutants are powerful tools to study gene function in vivo. These mutants exhibit wild-type activity at permissive temperatures and reduced activity at restrictive temperatures. Although random mutagenesis can be used to generate TS mutants, the procedure is laborious and unfeasible in multicellular organisms. Further, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the TS phenotype are poorly understood. To elucidate TS mechanisms, we used a machine learning method-logistic regression-to investigate a large number of sequence and structure features. We developed and tested 133 features, describing properties of either the mutation site or the mutation site neighborhood. We defined three types of neighborhood using sequence distance, Euclidean distance, and topological distance. We discovered that neighborhood features outperformed mutation site features in predicting TS mutations. The most predictive features suggest that TS mutations tend to occur at buried and rigid residues, and are located at conserved protein domains. The environment of a buried residue often determines the overall structural stability of a protein, thus may lead to reversible activity change upon temperature switch. We developed TS prediction models based on logistic regression and the Lasso regularized procedure. Through a ten-fold cross-validation, we obtained the area under the curve of 0.91 for the model using both sequence and structure features. Testing on independent datasets suggested that the model predicted TS mutations with a 50% precision. In summary, our study elucidated the molecular basis of TS mutants and suggested the importance of neighborhood properties in determining TS mutations. We further developed models to predict TS mutations derived from single amino acid substitutions. In this way, TS mutants can be efficiently obtained through experimentally introducing the predicted mutations.

However, detection and tracking of the junctions in four-dimensional (4D) images are challenging. The paper presents a novel framework to automate this task. Detection of their centers and sizes is first achieved by an analysis of local shape profiles on one segmented reference image. Junctions are then separately tracked by simultaneously using neighboring intensity features from all images. Defined by a closed B-spline space curve, the individual trajectory is assumed to be cyclic and obtained by maximizing the metric of combined correlation coefficients. Local extrema are suppressed by improving the initial conditions using random walks from pair-wise optimizations. Our approach has been applied to analyze the vessel junctions in five real 4D respiration-gated computed tomography (CT) image datasets with promising results. More than 500 junctions in the lung are detected with an average accuracy of greater than 85% and the mean error between the automated and the manual tracking is sub-voxel.

The segmentation is posed as a probabilistic optimization problem in which the optimal time-dependent surface is obtained for the myocardium of the heart in a discrete space of locations built upon simple geometric assumptions. For this purpose, first, the left ventricle is detected by a set of image analysis tools gathered from the literature. Then, the segmentation solution is obtained by the Maximization of the Posterior Marginals for the myocardium location in a Markov Random Field framework which optimally integrates temporal-spatial smoothness with intensity and gradient related features in an unsupervised way by the Maximum Likelihood estimation of the parameters of the field. This scheme provides a flexible and robust segmentation method which has been able to generate results comparable to manually segmented images for some derived cardiac function parameters in a set of 43 patients affected in different degrees by an Acute Myocardial Infarction.

10.1007/978-3-642-22092-0_3  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis  |  Generative Model  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   This paper presents a new supervised learning framework for the efficient recognition and segmentation of anatomical structures in 3D computed tomography (CT), with as little training data as possible. Training supervised classifiers to recognize organs within CT scans requires a large number of manually delineated exemplar 3D images, which are very expensive to obtain. In this study, we borrow ideas from the field of active learning to optimally select a minimum subset of such images that yields accurate anatomy segmentation. The main contribution of this work is in designing a combined generative-discriminative model which: i) drives optimal selection of training data; and ii) increases segmentation accuracy. The optimal training set is constructed by finding unlabeled scans which maximize the disagreement between our two complementary probabilistic models, as measured by a modified version of the Jensen-Shannon divergence. Our algorithm is assessed on a database of 196 labeled clinical CT scans with high variability in resolution, anatomy, pathologies, etc. Quantitative evaluation shows that, compared with randomly selecting the scans to annotate, our method decreases the number of training images by up to 45%. Moreover, our generative model of body shape substantially increases segmentation accuracy when compared to either using the discriminative model alone or a generic smoothness prior (e.g. via a Markov Random Field).

Development of an early diagnosis method may improve survivals. We aimed to develop a new diagnostic model for NSCLC using serum biomarkers. 
  Methods:  We set up a patient group diagnosed with NSCLC (n = 122) and a healthy control group (n = 225). Thirty serum analytes were selected on the basis of previous studies and a literature search. An antibody-bead array of 30 markers was constructed using the Luminex bead array platform (Luminex Inc, Austin, Tex) and was analyzed. Each marker was ranked by importance using the random forest method and then selected. Using selected markers, multivariate classification algorithms were constructed and were validated by application to independent validation cohort of 21 NSCLC and 28 control subjects. 
  Results:  There was no difference in demographics between patients and the control population except for age (64.8 ± 10.0 for patients vs 53.0 ± 7.6 years for the control group). Among the 30 serum proteins, 23 showed a difference between the 2 groups (12 increased and 11 decreased in the patient group). We found the highest accuracy of multivariate classification algorithms when using the 5 highest-ranked biomarkers (A1AT, CYFRA 21-1, IGF-1, RANTES, AFP). When we applied the algorithms on a validation cohort, each method recognized the patients from the controls with high accuracy (89.8% with random forest, 91.8% with support vector machine, 88.2% with linear discriminant analysis, and 90.5% with logistic regression). 
  Conclusions:  We confirmed that a new diagnostic method using 5 serum biomarkers profiling constructed by multivariate classification algorithms could distinguish NSCLC from healthy controls with high accuracy.

10.1016/j.jtcvs.2011.06.023  |  Robotics  |  Robotics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Review  |    Objective:  The vast majority of reports describing beating heart robotic myocardial revascularization (total endoscopic coronary artery bypass) contain very small numbers of patients undergoing single-vessel bypass. We present a large series of patients undergoing multivessel total endoscopic coronary artery bypass. 
  Methods:  We performed a retrospective clinical review of 106 patients undergoing total endoscopic coronary artery bypass (72% multivessel) at 1 institution by 1 experienced cardiac surgeon/physician assistant team. These results were compared with the expected clinical outcomes from conventional coronary artery bypass grafting calculated using the Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk calculator. 
  Results:  Of the 106 patients, 1% underwent quadruple total endoscopic coronary artery bypass, 8% triple, 63% double, and 28% single. The emergent conversion rate for hemodynamic instability was 6.6%. The postoperative renal failure rate (doubling of baseline serum creatinine or dialysis required) was 7.5%. Overall, 23 patients (21.7%) exhibited at least 1 major morbidity/mortality (4 deaths). The number of vessels bypassed (single/double/triple/quadruple) correlated positively with the surgical/operating room time, the lung separation time, vasoactive medication use, blood use, a postoperative ventilation time longer than 24 hours, intensive care unit length of stay, and hospital length of stay. An increased surgical time was significantly associated with major morbidity (P = .011) and mortality (P = .043). A comparison with the Society for Thoracic Surgeons expected outcomes revealed a similar hospital length of stay but an increased incidence of prolonged ventilation (P = .003), renal failure (P &lt; .001), morbidity (P = .045), and mortality (P = .049). 
  Conclusions:  Our results suggest that addressing multivessel coronary artery disease using total endoscopic coronary artery bypass offers no obvious clinical benefits and might increase the morbidity and mortality.

10.1371/journal.pone.0022513  |  Diagnosis, Genetics  |  Prognosis, Genetics  |  AITechniqueM  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has become a major concern in Western countries due to rapid rises in incidence coupled with very poor survival rates. One of the key risk factors for the development of this cancer is the presence of Barrett's esophagus (BE), which is believed to form in response to repeated gastro-esophageal reflux. In this study we performed comparative, genome-wide expression profiling (using Illumina whole-genome Beadarrays) on total RNA extracted from esophageal biopsy tissues from individuals with EAC, BE (in the absence of EAC) and those with normal squamous epithelium. We combined these data with publically accessible raw data from three similar studies to investigate key gene and ontology differences between these three tissue states. The results support the deduction that BE is a tissue with enhanced glycoprotein synthesis machinery (DPP4, ATP2A3, AGR2) designed to provide strong mucosal defenses aimed at resisting gastro-esophageal reflux. EAC exhibits the enhanced extracellular matrix remodeling (collagens, IGFBP7, PLAU) effects expected in an aggressive form of cancer, as well as evidence of reduced expression of genes associated with mucosal (MUC6, CA2, TFF1) and xenobiotic (AKR1C2, AKR1B10) defenses. When our results are compared to previous whole-genome expression profiling studies keratin, mucin, annexin and trefoil factor gene groups are the most frequently represented differentially expressed gene families. Eleven genes identified here are also represented in at least 3 other profiling studies. We used these genes to discriminate between squamous epithelium, BE and EAC within the two largest cohorts using a support vector machine leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) analysis. While this method was satisfactory for discriminating squamous epithelium and BE, it demonstrates the need for more detailed investigations into profiling changes between BE and EAC.

10.1016/j.eururo.2011.08.040  |  Robotics  |  Diagnosis, Treatment, Robotics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Robot-assisted and laparoscopic partial nephrectomies (PNs) for medial tumors are technically challenging even with the hilum clamped and, until now, were impossible to perform with the hilum unclamped. 
  Objective:  Evaluate whether targeted vascular microdissection (VMD) of renal artery branches allows zero-ischemia PN to be performed even for challenging medial tumors. 
  Design, setting, and participants:  A prospective cohort evaluation of 44 patients with renal masses who underwent robot-assisted or laparoscopic zero-ischemia PN either with anatomic VMD (group 1; n=22) or without anatomic VMD (group 2; n=22) performed by a single surgeon from April 2010 to January 2011. 
  Intervention:  Zero-ischemia PN with VMD incorporates four maneuvers: (1) preoperative computed tomographic reconstruction of renal arterial branch anatomy, (2) anatomic dissection of targeted, tumor-specific tertiary or higher-order renal arterial branches, (3) neurosurgical aneurysm microsurgical bulldog clamp(s) for superselective tumor devascularization, and (4) transient, controlled reduction of blood pressure, if necessary. 
  Measurements:  Baseline, perioperative, and postoperative data were collected prospectively. 
  Results and limitations:  Group 1 tumors were larger (4.3 vs 2.6 cm; p=0.011), were more often hilar (41% vs 9%; p=0.09), were medial (59% and 23%; p=0.017), were closer to the hilum (1.46 vs 3.26 cm; p=0.0002), and had a lower C index score (2.1 vs 3.9; p=0.004) and higher RENAL nephrometry scores (7.7 vs 6.2; p=0.013). Despite greater complexity, no group 1 tumor required hilar clamping, and perioperative outcomes were similar to those of group 2: operating room time (4.7 and 4.1h), median blood loss (200 and 100ml), surgical margins for cancer (all negative), major complications (0% and 9%), and minor complications (18% and 14%). The median serum creatinine level was similar 2 mo postoperatively (1.2 and 1.3mg/dl). The study was limited by the relatively small sample size. 
  Conclusions:  Anatomic targeted dissection and superselective control of tumor-specific renal arterial branches facilitate zero-ischemia PN. Even challenging medial and hilar tumors can be excised without hilar clamping. Global surgical renal ischemia has been eliminated for most patients undergoing PN at our institution.

10.1016/j.eururo.2011.12.027  |  Robotics  |  Treatment, Robotics  |  Multivariable Logistic Regression  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Prior to the introduction and dissemination of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP), population-based studies comparing open radical prostatectomy (ORP) and minimally invasive radical prostatectomy (MIRP) found no clinically significant difference in perioperative complication rates. 
  Objective:  Assess the rate of RARP utilization and reexamine the difference in perioperative complication rates between RARP and ORP in light of RARP's supplanting laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) as the most common MIRP technique. 
  Design, setting, and participants:  As of October 2008, a robot-assisted modifier was introduced to denote robot-assisted procedures. Relying on the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between October 2008 and December 2009, patients treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) were identified. The robot-assisted modifier (17.4x) was used to identify RARP (n=11 889). Patients with the minimally invasive modifier code (54.21) without the robot-assisted modifier were classified as having undergone LRP and were removed from further analyses. The remainder were classified as ORP patients (n=7389). 
  Intervention:  All patients underwent RARP or ORP. 
  Measurements:  We compared the rates of blood transfusions, intraoperative and postoperative complications, prolonged length of stay (pLOS), and in-hospital mortality. Multivariable logistic regression analyses of propensity score-matched populations, fitted with general estimation equations for clustering among hospitals, further adjusted for confounding factors. 
  Results and limitations:  Of 19 462 RPs, 61.1% were RARPs, 38.0% were ORPs, and 0.9% were LRPs. In multivariable analyses of propensity score-matched populations, patients undergoing RARP were less likely to receive a blood transfusion (odds ratio [OR]: 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28-0.40), to experience an intraoperative complication (OR: 0.47; 95% CI, 0.31-0.71) or a postoperative complication (OR: 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77-0.96), and to experience a pLOS (OR: 0.28; 95% CI, 0.26-0.30). Limitations of this study include lack of adjustment for tumor characteristics, surgeon volume, learning curve effect, and longitudinal follow-up. 
  Conclusions:  RARP has supplanted ORP as the most common surgical approach for RP. Moreover, we demonstrate superior adjusted perioperative outcomes after RARP in virtually all examined outcomes.

  Materials and methods:  Prospectively collected data of 184 patients treated with RALP at a single institution were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier and life tables analyses targeted the rates of BCR according to pathologic parameters. Cox regression analyses addressed predictors of BCR. 
  Results:  Median follow-up was 67.5 months. One and 10 patients died of prostate cancer (PCa) and other causes, respectively. Mean time to BCR was 83.8 months. The 3-, 5-, and 7-year BCR-free survival rates were 94%, 86%, and 81%, respectively. These rates were 97%, 93%, and 85% for pT2 disease; 94%, 84%, and 84% for pT3a; and 69%, 43%, and 43% for pT3b (P&lt;.001). The same figures were 97%, 90%, and 88% for Gleason sum 6 or lower; 90%, 86%, and 75% for Gleason sum 7; and 85%, 65%, and 65% for Gleason sum 8-10 (P=.01). At univariable analyses, prostate-specific antigen, pathologic Gleason score, and presence of extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, and adjuvant radiotherapy were significantly associated with BCR. At multivariable analysis, the presence of seminal vesicle invasion and the presence of Gleason sum 8-10 represented independent predictors of BCR (HR=5.14; P=.004 and HR=3.04; P=.04, respectively). 
  Conclusion:  We report the longest available follow-up in RALP patients. RALP represents an oncologically effective procedure. Our oncological results support the increasing diffusion of RALP for the treatment of organ-confined PCa.

The araL gene has been cloned, over-expressed in Escherichia coli and its product purified to homogeneity. The enzyme displays phosphatase activity, which is optimal at neutral pH (7.0) and 65 °C. Substrate screening and kinetic analysis showed AraL to have low specificity and catalytic activity towards several sugar phosphates, which are metabolic intermediates of the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways. On the basis of substrate specificity and gene context within the arabinose metabolic operon, a putative physiological role of AraL in the detoxification of accidental accumulation of phosphorylated metabolites has been proposed. The ability of AraL to catabolize several related secondary metabolites requires regulation at the genetic level. In the present study, using site-directed mutagenesis, we show that the production of AraL is regulated by a structure in the translation initiation region of the mRNA, which most probably blocks access to the ribosome-binding site, preventing protein synthesis. Members of haloalkanoate dehalogenase subfamily IIA and IIB are characterized by a broad-range and overlapping specificity anticipating the need for regulation at the genetic level. We provide evidence for the existence of a genetic regulatory mechanism controlling the production of AraL.

Patients older than 18 years, with malignant pharyngo-laryngeal tumors were enrolled in this prospective study after signing an informed consent. Four patients were enrolled in the study. The mean age was 56 years. One patient had a T1 base of tongue tumor, two patients had supraglottic tumors (T1, T2), and one had a T1 palatine tonsil tumor. All the procedures could be performed using a Maryland forceps, a 0° endoscope and a CO(2) LWG introduced via the robotic arm introducer. The laser parameters were: superpulse or continuous mode, 7-15 W, continuous delivery. The average set-up time was 30 min. The average surgical time was 94 min. No complications were noted due to the intraoperative use of the robot or the CO(2) LWG. One laser fiber was used for each of the surgeries. The mean coagulation depth was 200 μm (range 100-300). The mean hospital stay was 6 days. The CO(2) LWG is a reliable tool for TORS. It allowed more than 1 h of work without any trouble.

Nevertheless, methods of model prediction and mapping have yet to be established for soil microbial ecology. The present study was undertaken to develop an artificial-intelligence- and geographical information system (GIS)-integrated framework for predicting and mapping soil bacterial diversity using pre-existing environmental geospatial database information, and to further evaluate the applicability of soil bacterial diversity mapping for planning construction of eco-friendly roads. Using a stratified random sampling, soil bacterial diversity was measured in 196 soil samples in a forest area where construction of an eco-friendly road was planned. Model accuracy, coherence analyses, and tree analysis were systematically performed, and four-class discretized decision tree (DT) with ordinary pair-wise partitioning (OPP) was selected as the optimal model among tested five DT model variants. GIS-based simulations of the optimal DT model with varying weights assigned to soil ecological quality showed that the inclusion of soil ecology in environmental components, which are considered in environmental impact assessment, significantly affects the spatial distributions of overall environmental quality values as well as the determination of an environmentally optimized road route. This work suggests a guideline to use systematic accuracy, coherence, and tree analyses in selecting an optimal DT model from multiple candidate model variants, and demonstrates the applicability of the OPP-improved DT integrated with GIS in rule induction for mapping bacterial diversity. These findings also provide implication on the significance of soil microbial ecology in environmental impact assessment and eco-friendly construction planning.

10.3414/ME11-01-0060  |  Other  |  Treatment, Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Review  |    Background:  In the past decade, Medical Informatics (MI) and Bioinformatics (BI) have converged towards a new discipline, called Biomedical Informatics (BMI) bridging informatics methods across the spectrum from genomic research to personalized medicine and global healthcare. This convergence still raises challenging research questions which are being addressed by researchers internationally, which in turn raises the question of how biomedical informatics publications reflect the contributions from around the world in documenting the research. 
  Objectives:  To analyse the worldwide participation of biomedical informatics researchers from professional groups and societies in the best-known scientific conferences in the field. The analysis is focused on their geographical affiliation, but also includes other features, such as the impact and recognition of the conferences. 
  Methods:  We manually collected data about authors of papers presented at three major MI conferences: Medinfo, MIE and the AMIA symposium. In addition, we collected data from a BI conference, ISMB, as a comparison. Finally, we analyzed the impact and recognition of these conferences within their scientific contexts. 
  Results:  Data indicate a predominance of local authors at the regional conferences (AMIA and MIE), whereas other conferences with a world-wide scope (Medinfo and ISMB) had broader participation. Our analysis shows that the influence of these conferences beyond the discipline remains somewhat limited. 
  Conclusions:  Our results suggest that for BMI to be recognized as a broad discipline, both in the geographical and scientific sense, it will need to extend the scope of collaborations and their interdisciplinary impacts worldwide.

10.1109/TIP.2011.2160955  |  None  |  None, Other  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   In this paper, an iterative narrow-band-based graph cuts (INBBGC) method is proposed to optimize the geodesic active contours with region forces (GACWRF) model for interactive object segmentation. Based on cut metric on graphs proposed by Boykov and Kolmogorov, an NBBGC method is devised to compute the local minimization of GAC. An extension to an iterative manner, namely, INBBGC, is developed for less sensitivity to the initial curve. The INBBGC method is similar to graph-cuts-based active contour (GCBAC) presented by Xu , and their differences have been analyzed and discussed. We then integrate the region force into GAC. An improved INBBGC (IINBBGC) method is proposed to optimize the GACWRF model, thus can effectively deal with the concave region and complicated real-world images segmentation. Two region force models such as mean and probability models are studied. Therefore, the GCBAC method can be regarded as the special case of our proposed IINBBGC method without region force. Our proposed algorithm has been also analyzed to be similar to the Grabcut method when the Gaussian mixture model region force is adopted, and the band region is extended to the whole image. Thus, our proposed IINBBGC method can be regarded as narrow-band-based Grabcut method or GCBAC with region force method. We apply our proposed IINBBGC algorithm on synthetic and real-world images to emphasize its performance, compared with other segmentation methods, such as GCBAC and Grabcut methods.

10.1093/protein/gzr036  |  None  |  Prognosis, Drug Discovery, Treatment  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Structural water molecules are found in many protein-ligand complexes. They are known to be vital in mediating hydrogen-bonding interactions and, in some cases, key for facilitating tight binding. It is thus very important to consider water molecules when attempting to model protein-ligand interactions for cognate ligand identification, virtual screening and drug design. While the rigid treatment of water molecules present in structures is feasible, the more relevant task of treating all possible positions and orientations of water molecules with each possible ligand pose is computationally daunting. Current methods in molecular docking provide partial treatment for such water molecules, with modest success. Here we describe a new method employing dead-end elimination to place water molecules within a binding site, bridging interactions between protein and ligand. Dead-end elimination permits a thorough, though still incomplete, treatment of water placement. The results show that this method is able to place water molecules correctly within known complexes and to create physically reasonable hydrogen bonds. The approach has also been incorporated within an inverse molecular design approach, to model a variety of compounds in the process of de novo ligand design. The inclusion of structural water molecules, combined with ranking based on the electrostatic contribution to binding affinity, improves a number of otherwise poor energetic predictions.

10.1186/1746-1596-6-S1-S19  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Review  |    Background:  Digital pathology, i.e., applications of digital information technologies to pathology practice, has been expanding in the recent decades and the mode of pathology diagnostic practice is changing with enhanced precision. In the present study the changing processes of digital pathology in Japan were investigated and trends to future were discussed. 
  Methods:  The changing status of digital pathology was investigated through reviewing the records of annual meetings of the Japanese Research Society of Telepathology and Pathology Informatics (JRST-PI) and of the Japanese pathology related medical and informatics journals. The results of the Japanese questionnaire survey conducted in 2008-2009 on telepathology and virtual slide were also reviewed. In addition effectiveness of an experimental automatic pathology diagnostic aid system using computer artificial intelligence was investigated by checking its rate of correct diagnosis for given prostate carcinoma digital images. 
  Results:  Telepathology played a central role in the development of digital pathology in Japan. Both macroscopic and microscopic pathology digital images were routinely generated and used for diagnostic purposes in major hospitals. Virtual slide (VS) digital images were used first for education then for conference, consultation and also gradually for routine diagnosis and telepathology. The experimental automatic diagnostic aid system achieved the rate of correct diagnosis around 95% for prostate carcinoma and its use for automatic mapping of cancerous areas in a given tissue image was successful. 
  Conclusions:  Advance in the digital information technologies gave revolutionary impacts on pathology education, conference, consultation, diagnosis, telepathology and also on pathology diagnostic procedures in Japan. The future will be bright for pathologists by the advanced digital pathology but we should pay attention to make the technologies and their effects under our control.

An SCM system is adaptive, dynamic, open self-organizing, which is maintained by flows of information, materials, goods, funds, and energy. Traditional methods for modeling and optimizing complex SCM systems require huge amounts of computing resources, and biological intelligence-based solutions can often provide valuable alternatives for efficiently solving problems. The paper summarizes the recent related methods for the design and optimization of SCM systems, which covers the most widely used genetic algorithms and other evolutionary algorithms.

Despite marked improvement over earlier methodologies, the low level of specificity demonstrated by CT scanning has limited its clinical implementation as a screening tool. A minimally-invasive biomarker-based test that could further characterize CT-positive patients based on risk of malignancy would greatly enhance its clinical efficacy. 
  Methods:  We performed an analysis of 81 serum proteins in 92 patients diagnosed with lung cancer and 172 CT-screened control individuals. We utilize a series of bioinformatics algorithms including Metropolis-Monte Carlo, artificial neural networks, Naïve Bayes, and additive logistic regression to identify multimarker panels capable of discriminating cases from controls with high levels of sensitivity and specificity in distinct training and independent validation sets. 
  Results:  A three-biomarker panel comprised of MIF, prolactin, and thrombospondin identified using the Metropolis-Monte Carlo algorithm provided the best classification with a %Sensitivity/Specificity/Accuracy of 74/90/86 in the training set and 70/93/82 in the validation set. This panel was effective in the classification of control individuals demonstrating suspicious pulmonary nodules and stage I lung cancer patients. 
  Conclusions:  The selected serum biomarker panel demonstrated a high diagnostic utility in the current study and performance characteristics which compare favorably with previous reports. Further advancements may lead to the development of a diagnostic tool useful as an adjunct to CT-scanning.

10.1007/s00427-011-0378-0  |  Genetics  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Research  |   Driesch's statement, made around 1900, that the physics and chemistry of his day were unable to explain self-regulation during embryogenesis was correct and could be extended until the year 1972. The emergence of theories of self-organisation required progress in several areas including chemistry, physics, computing and cybernetics. Two parallel lines of development can be distinguished which both culminated in the early 1970s. Firstly, physicochemical theories of self-organisation arose from theoretical (Lotka 1910-1920) and experimental work (Bray 1920; Belousov 1951) on chemical oscillations. However, this research area gained broader acceptance only after thermodynamics was extended to systems far from equilibrium (1922-1967) and the mechanism of the prime example for a chemical oscillator, the Belousov-Zhabotinski reaction, was deciphered in the early 1970s. Secondly, biological theories of self-organisation were rooted in the intellectual environment of artificial intelligence and cybernetics. Turing wrote his The chemical basis of morphogenesis (1952) after working on the construction of one of the first electronic computers. Likewise, Gierer and Meinhardt's theory of local activation and lateral inhibition (1972) was influenced by ideas from cybernetics. The Gierer-Meinhardt theory provided an explanation for the first time of both spontaneous formation of spatial order and of self-regulation that proved to be extremely successful in elucidating a wide range of patterning processes. With the advent of developmental genetics in the 1980s, detailed molecular and functional data became available for complex developmental processes, allowing a new generation of data-driven theoretical approaches. Three examples of such approaches will be discussed. The successes and limitations of mathematical pattern formation theory throughout its history suggest a picture of the organism, which has structural similarity to views of the organic world held by the philosopher Immanuel Kant at the end of the eighteenth century.

Various clinical and pathological data are usually used in oral cancer prognosis. However, due to time, cost and tissue limitations, the number of prognosis variables need to be reduced. In this research, we demonstrated the use of feature selection methods to select a subset of variables that is highly predictive of oral cancer prognosis. The objective is to reduce the number of input variables, thus to identify the key clinicopathologic (input) variables of oral cancer prognosis based on the data collected in the Malaysian scenario. Two feature selection methods, genetic algorithm (wrapper approach) and Pearson's correlation coefficient (filter approach) were implemented and compared with single-input models and a full-input model. The results showed that the reduced models with feature selection method are able to produce more accurate prognosis results than the full-input model and single-input model, with the Pearson's correlation coefficient achieving the most promising results.

10.1093/molbev/msr222  |  Genetics  |  Diagnosis, Genetics  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Although the possibility of gene evolution by domain rearrangements has long been appreciated, current methods for reconstructing and systematically analyzing gene family evolution are limited to events such as duplication, loss, and sometimes, horizontal transfer. However, within the Drosophila clade, we find domain rearrangements occur in 35.9% of gene families, and thus, any comprehensive study of gene evolution in these species will need to account for such events. Here, we present a new computational model and algorithm for reconstructing gene evolution at the domain level. We develop a method for detecting homologous domains between genes and present a phylogenetic algorithm for reconstructing maximum parsimony evolutionary histories that include domain generation, duplication, loss, merge (fusion), and split (fission) events. Using this method, we find that genes involved in fusion and fission are enriched in signaling and development, suggesting that domain rearrangements and reuse may be crucial in these processes. We also find that fusion is more abundant than fission, and that fusion and fission events occur predominantly alongside duplication, with 92.5% and 34.3% of fusion and fission events retaining ancestral architectures in the duplicated copies. We provide a catalog of ∼9,000 genes that undergo domain rearrangement across nine sequenced species, along with possible mechanisms for their formation. These results dramatically expand on evolution at the subgene level and offer several insights into how new genes and functions arise between species.

Adaptive models for glucose prediction and recognition of hypoglycemia based on statistical and artificial intelligence techniques are presented. 
  Methods:  We compared an autoregressive (AR) model using only glucose information, an AR model with external insulin input (ARX), and an artificial neural network (ANN) using both glucose and insulin information. Online adaptive models were used to account for the intra- and inter-subject variability of the population with diabetes. The evaluation of the predictive ability included prediction horizons (PHs) of 30 min and 45 min. 
  Results:  The AR model presented root mean square error (RMSE) values of 14.0-21.6 mg/dL and correlation coefficients (CCs) of 0.92-0.95 for PH=30 min and 23.2-35.9 mg/dL and 0.79-0.87, respectively, for PH=45 min. The respective values for the ARX models were slightly better (PH=30 min, 13.3-18.8 mg/dL and 0.94-0.96; PH=45 min, 22.8-29.4 mg/dL and 0.83-0.88). For the ANN, the RMSE values ranged from 2.8 to 6.3 mg/dL, and the CC was 0.99 for all cases and PHs. The sensitivity of hypoglycemia prediction was 78% for AR, 81% for ARX, and 96% for ANN for PH=30 min and 65%, 67%, and 95%, respectively, for PH=45 min. The corresponding specificities were 96%, 96%, and 99% for PH=30 min and 93%, 93%, and 99% for PH=45 min. 
  Conclusions:  The ANN appears to be more appropriate for the prediction of glucose profile based on glucose and insulin data.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, the enzyme is a heterotetramer, containing two small subunits encoded by the APS1 gene and two large subunits encoded by the APL1-4 genes. TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes) of a chemically mutagenised population of A. thaliana plants identified 33 novel mutations in the APS1 gene, including 21 missense mutations in the protein coding region. High throughput measurements using a robotised cycling assay showed that maximal AGPase activity in the aps1 mutants varied from &lt;15 to 117% of wild type (WT), and that the kinetic properties of the enzyme were altered in several lines, indicating a role for the substituted amino acid residues in catalysis or substrate binding. These results validate the concept of using such a platform for efficient high-throughput screening of very large populations of mutants, natural accessions or introgression lines. AGPase was estimated to have a flux control coefficient of 0.20, indicating that the enzyme exerted only modest control over the rate of starch synthesis in plants grown under short day conditions (8 h light/16 h dark) with an irradiance of 150 μmol quanta m(-2)s(-1). Redox activation of the enzyme, via reduction of the intermolecular disulphide bridge between the two small subunits, was increased in several lines. This was sometimes, but not always, associated with a decrease in the abundance of the APS1 protein. In conclusion, the TILLING technique was used to generate an allelic series of aps1 mutants in A. thaliana that revealed new insights into the multi-layered regulation of AGPase. These mutants offer some advantages over the available loss-of-function mutants, e.g. adg1, for investigating the effects of subtle changes in the enzyme's activity on the rate of starch synthesis.

10.1016/j.eururo.2011.05.011  |  Robotics  |  Prognosis, Drug Discovery, Treatment, Robotics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Early studies reported comparative results of functional outcomes between robot-assisted (RARP) and retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP). However, well-controlled single-surgeon prospective studies comparing the outcomes are rare. 
  Objective:  To compare functional outcomes after RARP and RRP performed by a single surgeon, and to identify factors predictive of early return of continence and potency. 
  Design, setting, and participants:  A total of 763 consecutive patients undergoing RP between 2007 and 2010 were prospectively included and serially followed postoperatively for comparative analysis. 
  Intervention:  RARP was performed in 528 patients, and 235 underwent RRP. 
  Measurements:  Continence was defined as being completely pad free. Potency was defined as having erection sufficient for intercourse with or without a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor. Continence and potency recovery were checked serially by interview and questionnaire at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 mo postoperatively. Cox proportional hazards method analyses was performed to determine predictive factors for early recovery. 
  Results and limitations:  After the initial 132 cases, patients who underwent RARP demonstrated faster recovery of urinary continence compared to RRP patients. Potency recovery was more rapid in the RARP group at all evaluation time points, beginning from the initial cases. In multivariate analysis, younger age and longer preoperative membranous urethral length seen by prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated statistical significance as independent prognostic factors for continence recovery; younger age, surgical method (RARP vs RRP), and higher preoperative serum testosterone were independent prognostic factors for potency recovery. The limitations of the present study were that it was nonrandomized and used interview to evaluate potency recovery. 
  Conclusions:  Patients after RARP demonstrated superior functional recovery. Moreover, membranous urethral length on preoperative MRI and patient age were factors independently predictive of continence recovery, while patient age and higher preoperative serum testosterone were independent prognostic factors for potency recovery.

A dataset involving 158 samples, among which 105 were taken from healthy adults and the remaining 53 from patients with type-2 diabetes, was collected. All samples were split into the training set and the test set with the equal size. Based on a simple variable selection, two elements, i.e., chromium and iron, are also picked out as the most important elements. Three kinds of algorithms, i.e., fisher linear discriminate analysis (FLDA), support vector machine (SVM) and decision tree (DT), were used for constructing member models. The best ensemble classifiers constructed on the training set were validated on the independent test set, and the prediction results were compared with those from clinical diagnostics on the same subjects. The results reveal that almost all ensemble classifiers exhibit similar performance, implying that these elements coupled with an appropriate ensemble classifier can serve as a valuable tool of diagnosing diabetes type-2.

  Methods:  There is evidence of postoperative benefit for the patients undergoing laparoscopic adrenalectomy compared to open adrenalectomy (level B). 
  Results:  Results from comparison of oncological outcomes in ACC between open and laparoscopic approaches are equivocal: increasedrisk of local recurrence and peritoneal carcinomatosis by the laparoscopic route (level D), and identical results between the two approaches in terms of survival, recurrence and peritoneal carcinomatosis (level C). 
  Conclusion:  An open approach is recommended in case of local invasion, with a view to achieving an R0 resection (level D). Laparoscopic resection of ACC/potentially malignant tumours, which includes removal of surrounding periadrenal fat and results in an R0 resection without tumour capsule rupture, may be performed for preoperative and intraoperative stage 1-2 ACC and tumours with a diameter &lt; 10 cm (level C).

10.1016/j.procs.2011.04.219  |  Drug Discovery  |  Prognosis, Drug Discovery  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   The assessment of chemical similarity between molecules is a basic operation in chemoinformatics, a computational area concerning with the manipulation of chemical structural information. Comparing molecules is the basis for a wide range of applications such as searching in chemical databases, training prediction models for virtual screening or aggregating clusters of similar compounds. However, currently available multimillion databases represent a challenge for conventional chemoinformatics algorithms raising the necessity for faster similarity methods. In this paper, we extensively analyze the advantages of using many-core architectures for calculating some commonly-used chemical similarity coefficients such as Tanimoto, Dice or Cosine. Our aim is to provide a wide-breath <i>proof-of-concept</i> regarding the usefulness of GPU architectures to chemoinformatics, a class of computing problems still uncovered. In our work, we present a general GPU algorithm for all-to-all chemical comparisons considering both binary fingerprints and floating point descriptors as molecule representation. Subsequently, we adopt optimization techniques to minimize global memory accesses and to further improve efficiency. We test the proposed algorithm on different experimental setups, a laptop with a low-end GPU and a desktop with a more performant GPU. In the former case, we obtain a 4-to-6-fold speed-up over a single-core implementation for fingerprints and a 4-to-7-fold speed-up for descriptors. In the latter case, we respectively obtain a 195-to-206-fold speed-up and a 100-to-328-fold speed-up.

We compared subject performances in two isomorphic, but visually different, tasks based on a card game of SET. Although subjects used the same strategy in both tasks, the difference in presentation style resulted in radically different reaction times and significant deviations in scanpath patterns in the two tasks. Results from our study indicate that low-level subconscious visual processes, such as differential acuity in peripheral vision and low-level iconic memory, can have indirect, but significant effects on decision making during a problem-solving task. We have developed two ACT-R models that employ the same basic strategy but deal with different presentations styles. Our ACT-R models confirm that changes in low-level visual processes triggered by changes in presentation style can propagate to higher-level cognitive processes. Such a domino effect can significantly affect reaction times and eye movements, without affecting the overall strategy of problem solving.

10.1371/journal.pone.0077263  |  Genetics, Other  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Honey bees are essential pollinators of numerous agricultural crops. Since 2006, honey bee populations have suffered considerable annual losses that are partially attributed to Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). CCD is an unexplained phenomenon that correlates with elevated incidence of pathogens, including RNA viruses. Honey bees are eusocial insects that live in colonies of genetically related individuals that work in concert to gather and store nutrients. Their social organization provides numerous benefits, but also facilitates pathogen transmission between individuals. To investigate honey bee antiviral defense mechanisms, we developed an RNA virus infection model and discovered that administration of dsRNA, regardless of sequence, reduced virus infection. Our results suggest that dsRNA, a viral pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP), triggers an antiviral response that controls virus infection in honey bees.

10.1159/000354352  |  Prognosis, Robotics  |  Prognosis, Robotics  |  MultivariateAnalysis-Stat  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Objectives:  To assess the preoperative urodynamic predictors of urinary incontinence (UI) 1 year after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) and to design a nomogram capable of predicting its occurrence. 
  Materials and methods:  Our prospective study included 58 previously continent patients who underwent RARP, in most cases, bilateral nerve-sparing and bladder neck preservation. A urodynamic examination including a urethral pressure profile was performed preoperatively. Multivariate analysis was used to assess the predictors for the need to use 1 or more pads/day and a nomogram was constructed. 
  Results:  There was a 20.6% incidence of UI at 1 year after RARP. Bladder compliance, maximum urethral closure pressure and the development of bladder outlet obstruction, correlated well with the incidence of UI on the multivariate analysis (p = 0.043, 0.001, and 0.05, respectively). 
  Conclusion:  Bladder compliance &lt;27.8 ml/cm H2O, maximum urethral closure pressure &lt;50.3 cm H2O and the bladder outlet obstruction are independent urodynamic factors correlating with UI after RARP. The new nomogram can objectively predict a patient likelihood of requiring 1 or more pads/day 1 year after RARP with a good accuracy.

Two thirds of cases occur at an advanced stage. For advanced disease, progression-free survival, despite undeniable progress, remains below 50% at three years. The last 20 years have been marked by the necessity to identify situations where less intense surgery and/or radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy is possible without jeopardizing the prognosis, and situations where a therapeutic intensification is necessary and results in a gain in survival while better preserving function with less toxicity. French cooperative groups gathering radiation oncologists (GORTEC), surgeons (GETTEC) and medical oncologists or physicians involved in the management of systemic treatments in head and neck cancers (GERCOR) are now belonging to the INCa-labelled Intergroup ORL to deal with the challenges of head and neck cancers.

A total of 44,767,566 Illumina clean reads corresponding to 4.52 Gb nucleotides were generated and assembled into 100,252 unigenes (average length: 1,042 bp; range: 201-19,357 bp). 17,097 (26.09%) of 65,535 non-redundant unigenes were annotated in NCBI non-redundant protein (Nr) database. Moreover, 23,188 (35.38%) unigenes were assigned to three Gene Ontology (GO) categories, 15,071 (23.00%) to twenty-six Clusters of orthologous Groups (COG) and 8,574 (13.08%) to six Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, respectively. Numerous genes were further identified to be associated with multiple immune pathways, including Toll, immune deficiency (IMD), janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Some of them, such as tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP), JNK-interacting protein 1 (JIP1), were first identified in E. sinensis. TRAF6 was even first discovered in crabs. Additionally, 49,555 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were developed from over 13,309 unigenes. This is the first transcriptome report of whole bodies of E. sinensis larvae after immune challenge. Data generated here not only provide detail information to identify novel genes in genome reference-free E. sinensis, but also facilitate our understanding on host immunity and defense mechanism of the crab at whole transcriptome level.

10.1186/1471-2164-14-702  |  Genetics, Other  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  EST (expressed sequence tag) sequences and their annotation provide a highly valuable resource for gene discovery, genome sequence annotation, and other genomics studies that can be applied in genetics, breeding and conservation programs for non-model organisms. Conifers are long-lived plants that are ecologically and economically important globally, and have a large genome size. Black spruce (Picea mariana), is a transcontinental species of the North American boreal and temperate forests. However, there are limited transcriptomic and genomic resources for this species. The primary objective of our study was to develop a black spruce transcriptomic resource to facilitate on-going functional genomics projects related to growth and adaptation to climate change. 
  Results:  We conducted bidirectional sequencing of cDNA clones from a standard cDNA library constructed from black spruce needle tissues. We obtained 4,594 high quality (2,455 5' end and 2,139 3' end) sequence reads, with an average read-length of 532 bp. Clustering and assembly of ESTs resulted in 2,731 unique sequences, consisting of 2,234 singletons and 497 contigs. Approximately two-thirds (63%) of unique sequences were functionally annotated. Genes involved in 36 molecular functions and 90 biological processes were discovered, including 24 putative transcription factors and 232 genes involved in photosynthesis. Most abundantly expressed transcripts were associated with photosynthesis, growth factors, stress and disease response, and transcription factors. A total of 216 full-length genes were identified. About 18% (493) of the transcripts were novel, representing an important addition to the Genbank EST database (dbEST). Fifty-seven di-, tri-, tetra- and penta-nucleotide simple sequence repeats were identified. 
  Conclusions:  We have developed the first high quality EST resource for black spruce and identified 493 novel transcripts, which may be species-specific related to life history and ecological traits. We have also identified full-length genes and microsatellite-containing ESTs. Based on EST sequence similarities, black spruce showed close evolutionary relationships with congeneric Picea glauca and Picea sitchensis compared to other Pinaceae members and angiosperms. The EST sequences reported here provide an important resource for genome annotation, functional and comparative genomics, molecular breeding, conservation and management studies and applications in black spruce and related conifer species.

10.1002/pds.3351  |  Other  |  None, Other  |  AITechniqueM  |  NLP  |  Research  |  Review  |    Purpose:  Bioequivalent medications are required by the Food and Drug Administration to have identical warnings on their labels. This requirement has both clinical and legal importance, yet has never been validated. We sought to determine the real-world consistency of electronic labeling for bioequivalent drugs from different manufacturers. 
  Methods:  Using natural language processing, we indexed the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) found in the Adverse Reactions and Post-Marketing sections of 9105 structured product labels. We calculated the standard deviation in ADR labeling for each bioequivalent drug and the percent deviation of each generic label from its corresponding brand. We also analyzed the performance of individual generic manufacturers. For the 25 drugs with the greatest discrepancy in labeled ADRs, we performed manual review to identify causes of inconsistency. 
  Results:  68% of multi-manufacturer drugs had discrepancies in ADR labeling. For a given drug, the mean deviation in number of labeled ADRs was 4.4, and the median was 0.8 (IQR 0 to 3.2). The mean range in number of labeled ADRs was 12 +/- 0.9, and the median was 2 (IQR 0 to 9). Overall, 77.9% of generic manufacturers produced labels differing from brand. Causes of inconsistency included missing tables, outdated post-marketing reports, and formatting issues. 
  Conclusions:  Despite FDA mandate, bioequivalent drugs often differ in their safety labeling. Physicians should be aware of such differences and regulators should consider new strategies for harmonizing bioequivalent labels.

10.1002/jmri.24390  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis  |  Diagnosis, Treatment  |  SupportVectorMachine  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Review  |    Purpose:  To retrospectively evaluate the performance of an automatic support vector machine (SVM) routine in combination with perfusion-based dynamic susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance imaging (DSC-MRI) for preoperative survival associations in patients with gliomas and compare our results to traditional MRI. 
  Materials and methods:  The study was approved by the Ethics Committee and informed consent was signed. Structural, diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MRI was performed at 1.5-T preoperatively in 94 adult patients (49 males, 45 females, 23-82 years; mean 51 years) later diagnosed with a primary glioma. Patients were randomly assigned in training and test datasets and the resulting DSC-based survival associations by SVM were compared to traditional MRI features including contrast-agent enhancement, perfusion- and diffusion-weighted imaging, tumor size, and location. The results were adjusted for age, neurological status, and postoperative factors associated with survival, including surgery and adjuvant therapy. 
  Results:  For 1- (26/33 alive, 11/14 deceased), 2- (15/21, 21/26), 3- (12/16, 27/31) and 4- (12/15, 28/32) year survival associations in the test dataset (47 patients), the SVM routine was the only biomarker to consistently associate with survival (Cox; P &lt; 0.001). 
  Conclusion:  The automatic machine learning routine presented in our study may provide the operator with a reliable instrument for assessing survival in patients with glioma.

10.1007/s00464-012-2655-z  |  Robotics  |  Robotics  |  MultivariateAnalysis-Stat  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  There are scant data on patient safety and the national diffusion of surgical innovations. Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) provides an apt model for population-based analyses of patient safety and the propagation of complex surgical innovations. 
  Methods:  In the nationwide inpatient sample, we identified patients undergoing partial nephrectomy for renal tumors from 1998 to 2009 and utilized patient safety indicators (PSI) to measure preventable adverse outcomes. 
  Results:  Of the cases, 68,713 (87 %) were OPN and 9,842 (13 %) were LPN. The prevalence of LPN increased more than threefold from 2006 to 2009. Compared to open partial nephrectomy (OPN), LPN patients were more likely to be younger (p = 0.022), have lower Charlson comorbidity scores (p = 0.002), and undergo surgery at urban (p &lt; 0.001) and teaching (p = 0.02) hospitals. On multivariate analysis, LPN was associated with a 28 % decreased probability of any PSI (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj] 0.72, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.55-0.96, p = 0.025), although this benefit did not attain significance when comparing robot-assisted LPN to OPN (ORadj 0.72, 95 % CI 0.44-1.16, p = 0.173). Overall mortality decreased from 0.9 % in 1998 to 0.1 % in 2009 (p &lt; 0.001). There were no differences in adjusted mortality between LPN and OPN (p = 0.75). 
  Conclusions:  During its initial national diffusion, LPN resulted in enhanced perioperative patient safety compared to OPN. Mortality for both LPN and OPN decreased over time. Further study is needed to elucidate and promote factors contributing to the safe diffusion of complex surgical innovations.

10.1093/pcp/pct057  |  Genetics, Other  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Medicinal and industrial properties of phytochemicals (e.g. glycyrrhizin) from the root of Glycyrrhiza uralensis (licorice plant) made it an attractive, multimillion-dollar trade item. Bioengineering is one of the solutions to overcome such high market demand and to protect plants from extinction. Unfortunately, limited genomic information on medicinal plants restricts their research and thus biosynthetic mechanisms of many important phytochemicals are still poorly understood. In this work we utilized the de novo (no reference genome sequence available) assembly of Illumina RNA-Seq data to study the transcriptome of the licorice plant. Our analysis is based on sequencing results of libraries constructed from samples belonging to different tissues (root and leaf) and collected in different seasons and from two distinct strains (low and high glycyrrhizin producers). We provide functional annotations and the expression profile of 43,882 assembled unigenes, which are suitable for various further studies. Here, we searched for G. uralensis-specific enzymes involved in isoflavonoid biosynthesis as well as elucidated putative cytochrome P450 enzymes and putative vacuolar saponin transporters involved in glycyrrhizin production in the licorice root. To disseminate the data and the analysis results, we constructed a publicly available G. uralensis database. This work will contribute to a better understanding of the biosynthetic pathways of secondary metabolites in licorice plants, and possibly in other medicinal plants, and will provide an important resource to further advance transcriptomic studies in legumes.

10.1016/j.eururo.2013.05.020  |  Robotics  |  Diagnosis, Robotics  |  KaplanMeyerAnalysis-Stat  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Although open radical cystectomy (ORC) remains the gold standard of care for muscle-invasive bladder cancer, robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) continues to gain wider acceptance. In this article, we focus on the steps of RARC, describing our approach, which has been developed over the past 10 yr. Totally intracorporeal RARC aims to offer the benefits of a complete minimally invasive approach while replicating the oncologic outcomes of open surgery. 
  Objective:  We report our outcomes of a totally intracorporeal RARC procedure, describing step by step our technique and highlighting the variations on this standard template of nerve-sparing and female organ-preserving approaches in men and women. 
  Design, setting, and participants:  Between December 2003 and October 2012, a total of 113 patients (94 male and 19 female) underwent totally intracorporeal RARC. 
  Surgical procedure:  We performed RARC, extended pelvic lymph node dissection, and a totally intracorporeal urinary diversion (UD) in all patients. In the accompanying video, we focus on the standard template for RARC, also describing nerve-sparing and female organ-preserving approaches. 
  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:  Complications and oncologic outcomes are reported, including overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) using Kaplan-Meier analysis. 
  Results and limitations:  RARC with intracorporeal UD was performed in 113 patients. Mean age was 64 yr (range: 37-84). Forty-three patients underwent intracorporeal ileal conduit, and 70 had intracorporeal neobladder. On surgical pathology, 48% of patients had ≤ pT1 disease, 27% had pT2 disease, 13% had pT3 disease, and 12% had pT4 disease. The mean number of lymph nodes removed was 21 (range: 0-57). Twenty percent of patients had lymph node-positive disease. Positive surgical margins occurred in six cases (5.3%). Median follow-up was 25 mo (range: 3-107). We recorded a total of 70 early complications (0-30 d) in 54 patients (47.8%), with 37 patients (32.7%) having Clavien grade ≥ 3. Thirty-six late complications (&gt;30 d) were recorded in 30 patients (26.5%), with 20 patients (17.7%) having Clavien grade ≥ 3. One patient (0.9%) died within 90 days of operation from pulmonary embolism. Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, CSS was 81% at 3 yr and 67% at 5 yr. 
  Conclusions:  Our structured approach to RARC has enabled us to develop this complex service while maintaining patient outcomes and complication rates comparable with ORC series. Our results demonstrate acceptable oncologic outcomes and encouraging long-term CSS rates.

10.1111/jcmm.12205  |  Genetics  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   The mechanisms of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection remain elusive. Roles of microRNA (miRNA) have been highlighted in pathogen-host interactions recently. To identify miRNAs involved in the immune response to TB, expression profiles of miRNAs in CD4(+) T cells from patients with latent TB, active TB and healthy controls were investigated by microarray assay and validated by RT-qPCR. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were used to analyse the significant functions and involvement in signalling pathways of the differentially expressed miRNAs. To identify potential target genes for miR-29, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) mRNA expression was measured by RT-qPCR. Our results showed that 27 miRNAs were deregulated among the three groups. RT-qPCR results were generally consistent with the microarray data. We observed an inverse correlation between miR-29 level and IFN-γ mRNA expression in CD4(+) T cells. GO and KEGG pathway analysis showed that the possible target genes of deregulated miRNAs were significantly enriched in mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling pathway, focal adhesion and extracellular matrix receptor interaction, which might be involved in the transition from latent to active TB. In all, for the first time, our study revealed that some miRNAs in CD4(+) T cells were altered in latent and active TB. Function and pathway analysis highlighted the possible involvement of miRNA-deregulated mRNAs in TB. The study might help to improve understanding of the relationship between miRNAs in CD4(+) T cells and TB, and laid an important foundation for further identification of the underlying mechanisms of latent TB infection and its reactivation.

10.1097/BRS.0b013e31826b3d72  |  Robotics  |  Robotics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Review  |    Study design:  Technique development to use the da Vince Robotic Surgical System for anterior lumbar interbody fusion at L5-S1 is detailed. A case report is also presented. 
  Objective:  To evaluate and develop the da Vinci robotic assisted laparoscopic anterior lumbar stand-alone interbody fusion procedure. 
  Summary of background data:  Anterior lumbar interbody fusion is a common procedure associated with potential morbidity related to the surgical approach. The da Vinci robot provides intra-abdominal dissection and visualization advantages compared with the traditional open and laparoscopic approach. 
  Methods:  The surgical techniques for approach to the anterior lumbar spine using the da Vinci robot were developed and modified progressively beginning with operative models followed by placement of an interbody fusion cage in the living porcine model. Development continued to progress with placement of fusion cage in a human cadaver, completed first in the laboratory setting and then in the operating room. Finally, the first patient with fusion completed using the da Vinci robot-assisted approach is presented. 
  Results:  The anterior transperitoneal approach to the lumbar spine is accomplished with enhanced visualization and dissection capability, with maintenance of pneumoperitoneum using the da Vinci robot. Blood loss is minimal. The visualization inside the disc space and surrounding structures was considered better than current open and laparoscopic techniques. 
  Conclusion:  The da Vinci robot Surgical System technique continues to develop and is now described for the transperitoneal approach to the anterior lumbar spine. 
  Level of evidence:  4.

10.1371/journal.pone.0066539  |  Genetics, Other  |  Diagnosis, Drug Discovery, Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Lead (Pb), one of the most toxic heavy metals, can be absorbed and accumulated by plant roots and then enter the food chain resulting in potential health risks for human beings. The radish (Raphanus sativus L.) is an important root vegetable crop with fleshy taproots as the edible parts. Little is known about the mechanism by which radishes respond to Pb stress at the molecular level. In this study, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based RNA-seq technology was employed to characterize the de novo transcriptome of radish roots and identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during Pb stress. A total of 68,940 assembled unique transcripts including 33,337 unigenes were obtained from radish root cDNA samples. Based on the assembled de novo transcriptome, 4,614 DEGs were detected between the two libraries of untreated (CK) and Pb-treated (Pb1000) roots. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis revealed that upregulated DEGs under Pb stress are predominately involved in defense responses in cell walls and glutathione metabolism-related processes, while downregulated DEGs were mainly involved in carbohydrate metabolism-related pathways. The expression patterns of 22 selected genes were validated by quantitative real-time PCR, and the results were highly accordant with the Solexa analysis. Furthermore, many candidate genes, which were involved in defense and detoxification mechanisms including signaling protein kinases, transcription factors, metal transporters and chelate compound biosynthesis related enzymes, were successfully identified in response to heavy metal Pb. Identification of potential DEGs involved in responses to Pb stress significantly reflected alterations in major biological processes and metabolic pathways. The molecular basis of the response to Pb stress in radishes was comprehensively characterized. Useful information and new insights were provided for investigating the molecular regulation mechanism of heavy metal Pb accumulation and tolerance in root vegetable crops.

10.1111/j.1477-2574.2012.00589.x  |  Robotics  |  Robotics  |  Stat  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Review  |    Background:  To potentially improve outcomes in pancreatic resection, robot-assisted pancreatic surgery has been introduced. This technique has possible advantages over laparoscopic surgery, such as its affordance of three-dimensional vision and increased freedom of movement of instruments. A systematic review was performed to assess the safety and feasibility of robot-assisted pancreatic surgery. 
  Methods:  The literature published up to 30 September 2011 was systematically reviewed, with no restrictions on publication date. Studies reporting on over five patients were included. Animal studies, studies not reporting morbidity and mortality, review articles and conference abstracts were excluded. Data were extracted and weighted means were calculated. 
  Results:  A total of 499 studies were screened, after which eight cohort studies reporting on a total of 251 patients undergoing robot-assisted pancreatic surgery were retained for analysis. Weighted mean operation time was 404 ± 102 min (510 ± 107 min for pancreatoduodenectomy only). The rate of conversion was 11.0% (16.4% for pancreatoduodenectomy only). Overall morbidity was 30.7% (n = 77), most frequently involving pancreatic fistulae (n = 46). Mortality was 1.6%. Negative surgical margins were obtained in 92.9% of patients. The rate of spleen preservation in distal pancreatectomy was 87.1%. 
  Conclusions:  Robot-assisted pancreatic surgery seems to be safe and feasible in selected patients and, in left-sided resections, may increase the rate of spleen preservation. Randomized studies should compare the respective outcomes of robot-assisted, laparoscopic and open pancreatic surgery.

PMID:23783051  |  Treatment, Robotics  |  Robotics  |  MultivariateAnalysis-Stat  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Introduction:  Two prospective trials have demonstrated prophylactic antimuscarinics following prostatectomy reduce pain from bladder spasms. Our practice adopted the routine administration of prophylactic belladonna and opium (B&amp;O) suppositories to patients undergoing robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP). The aim of this study is to determine if this change in clinical practice was associated with improvement of postoperative outcomes. 
  Materials and methods:  The medical records of 202 patients that underwent RALP surgery who were or were not administered prophylactic B&amp;O suppositories in the immediate postoperative period were abstracted for duration of anesthesia recovery, pain and analgesic use. 
  Results:  Patient and surgical characteristics between groups were similar except B&amp;O group were slightly older (p = 0.04) and administered less opioid analgesics (p = 0.05). There was no difference between groups in the duration of phase I recovery from anesthesia (p = 0.96). Multivariable adjustments for age, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, and surgical duration were made, and again it was found that suppository administration had no association with phase I recovery times (p = 0.94). The use of antimuscarinic medication for bladder spams in the B&amp;O group was less during phase I recovery (p &lt; 0.01), but was similar during the first 24 hours (p = 0.66). Postoperative sedation, opioid analgesic requirements and pain scales were similar during phase I recovery and the first 24 postoperative hours. Hospital length of stay was similar. 
  Discussion:  The introduction of prophylactic B&amp;O suppositories at the immediate conclusion of RALP surgery was not associated with improvements of the postoperative course.

  Methods:  We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of patients who underwent a laparoscopic or robotic partial nephrectomy between August 2006 and July 2012 by a single surgeon. Measurements of OAF and IAF were obtained from preoperative cross-sectional imaging available through our institution's imaging archive. Preoperative clinical parameters, including BMI, OAF and IAF, were evaluated for associations with postoperative complications, operative time and length of hospital stay. 
  Results:  In total, 257 patients underwent a minimally invasive partial nephrectomy during the study period. Of these patients, 195 (75.9%) had preoperative scans available for analysis of OAF and IAF. A total of 52 (26.7%) patients experienced a Clavien grade I-IV complication within 30 days of surgery, 18 (34.6%) of which were grade III-IV. No patient experienced a grade V complication. On multivariate analysis, only increasing IAF (OR 1.05 [95% CI 1.02-1.09], P = .005) was associated with grade I-IV complications, while IAF (OR 1.05 [95% CI 1.00-1.10], P = .04) and intermediate to high tumor complexity (OR 5.31 [95% CI 1.47-19.17], P = .01) were associated with grade III-IV complications. BMI, OAF and IAF were not found to be independently associated with operative time or length of hospital stay. 
  Conclusion:  IAF is independently associated with complications following minimally invasive partial nephrectomy. With further validation, this measurement may prove useful in the preoperative risk stratification of patients with small renal masses.

10.1002/hed.23238  |  Robotics  |  Robotics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Oncologic resection of the clivus, nasopharynx, craniovertebral junction, and infratemporal fossa is a challenging endeavor because of their complex and protected anatomy. Our goals were to design a cadaveric model and identify advantages and limitations of combining the transoral robotic surgery (TORS) and endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) techniques. 
  Methods:  Cadaveric specimens were dissected using a da Vinci surgical robot and endoscopic endonasal instruments in a fashion that mimicked our operating room environment. We then applied these techniques clinically. 
  Results:  EEA was performed to provide a detailed dissection of the infratemporal fossa, nasopharynx, posterior skull base (clivus), and craniovertebral junction. Using TORS, we dissected the parapharyngeal space, infratemporal fossa, and nasopharynx below the eustachian tube, which represented a transition zone that delineated the most effective resection field of each approach. 
  Conclusions:  TORS and EEA seem to be complementary techniques; thus, their combined use seems advantageous for selected advanced tumors in these complex areas.

  Study design:  Prospective data collection. 
  Methods:  Patient records receiving TORS-SL for squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) with at least 12 months follow-up fit inclusion for this study. Two patients with previous SCCA were excluded. 
  Results:  18 patients (14 male, 4 female) were included in the study, having a mean follow-up time of 28.1 months (SD = 12.1). All patients had negative margins confirmed on final pathology. Nine (50%) patients received postoperative chemoradiation therapy for advanced neck disease. No (0%) patients received tracheostomy or gastrostomy tubes. There were no (0%) local recurrences, and three (16.7%) regional recurrences. Five (27.8%) patients experienced temporary postoperative complications. Overall 2-year outcomes reached 83%, 100%, and 89% for locoregional control, disease-specific survival, and overall survival respectively. 
  Conclusions:  Initial outcomes for TORS-SL are encouraging and are comparable to previously described treatment modalities. Larger studies are encouraged.

10.1037/a0029759  |  Other  |  Prognosis  |  Stat  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Summed-similarity models of short-term item recognition posit that participants base their judgments of an item's prior occurrence on that item's summed similarity to the ensemble of items on the remembered list. We examined the neural predictions of these models in 3 short-term recognition memory experiments using electrocorticographic/depth electrode recordings and scalp electroencephalography. On each experimental trial, participants judged whether a test face had been among a small set of recently studied faces. Consistent with summed-similarity theory, participants' tendency to endorse a test item increased as a function of its summed similarity to the items on the just-studied list. To characterize this behavioral effect of summed similarity, we successfully fit a summed-similarity model to individual participant data from each experiment. Using the parameters determined from fitting the summed-similarity model to the behavioral data, we examined the relation between summed similarity and brain activity. We found that 4-9 Hz theta activity in the medial temporal lobe and 2-4 Hz delta activity recorded from frontal and parietal cortices increased with summed similarity. These findings demonstrate direct neural correlates of the similarity computations that form the foundation of several major cognitive theories of human recognition memory.

  Methods:  Starting from 04/2009, consecutive patients with LACC were submitted to robotic surgical staging after NACT. Surgical outcomes were compared to those achieved by women undergoing robotic surgery for an early stage disease during the same temporal interval. 
  Results:  Overall 25 (Group 1) and 21 (Group 2) patients had an early stage and a LACC, respectively. Among women with LACC, 18 achieved best tumor responses to NACT and therefore they were addressed to RRH. Outcomes resulted comparable between Groups in terms of operative time, blood loss, hospitalization and complications. No differences were found in terms of nodal yield, parametrial and vaginal cuff length. 
  Conclusions:  RRH is feasible and safe also in patients previously submitted to NACT for LACC. Larger series with longer follow-up are mandatory to establish survival outcomes.

10.1021/ct400383v  |  Drug Discovery  |  Drug Discovery  |  Stat  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Here we present a novel, end-point method using the dead-end-elimination and A* algorithms to efficiently and accurately calculate the change in free energy, enthalpy, and configurational entropy of binding for ligand-receptor association reactions. We apply the new approach to the binding of a series of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) protease inhibitors to examine the effect ensemble reranking has on relative accuracy as well as to evaluate the role of the absolute and relative ligand configurational entropy losses upon binding in affinity differences for structurally related inhibitors. Our results suggest that most thermodynamic parameters can be estimated using only a small fraction of the full configurational space, and we see significant improvement in relative accuracy when using an ensemble versus single-conformer approach to ligand ranking. We also find that using approximate metrics based on the single-conformation enthalpy differences between the global minimum energy configuration in the bound as well as unbound states also correlates well with experiment. Using a novel, additive entropy expansion based on conditional mutual information, we also analyze the source of ligand configurational entropy loss upon binding in terms of both uncoupled per degree of freedom losses as well as changes in coupling between inhibitor degrees of freedom. We estimate entropic free energy losses of approximately +24 kcal/mol, 12 kcal/mol of which stems from loss of translational and rotational entropy. Coupling effects contribute only a small fraction to the overall entropy change (1-2 kcal/mol) but suggest differences in how inhibitor dihedral angles couple to each other in the bound versus unbound states. The importance of accounting for flexibility in drug optimization and design is also discussed.

Here, we draw out connections between these notions and various current issues in cognitive science, including the nature of mental "programs" and mental representation. We argue that programs (consisting of algorithms and data structures) have a causal (counterfactual-supporting) structure; these counterfactuals can reveal the nature of mental representations. Programs can also provide a causal model of the external world. Such models are, we suggest, ubiquitous in perception, cognition, and language processing.

10.1101/gr.144899.112  |  Genetics  |  Prognosis, Genetics  |  Stat  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Genome-wide chromatin annotations have permitted the mapping of putative regulatory elements across multiple human cell types. However, their experimental dissection by directed regulatory motif disruption has remained unfeasible at the genome scale. Here, we use a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to measure the transcriptional levels induced by 145-bp DNA segments centered on evolutionarily conserved regulatory motif instances within enhancer chromatin states. We select five predicted activators (HNF1, HNF4, FOXA, GATA, NFE2L2) and two predicted repressors (GFI1, ZFP161) and measure reporter expression in erythroleukemia (K562) and liver carcinoma (HepG2) cell lines. We test 2104 wild-type sequences and 3314 engineered enhancer variants containing targeted motif disruptions, each using 10 barcode tags and two replicates. The resulting data strongly confirm the enhancer activity and cell-type specificity of enhancer chromatin states, the ability of 145-bp segments to recapitulate both, the necessary role of regulatory motifs in enhancer function, and the complementary roles of activator and repressor motifs. We find statistically robust evidence that (1) disrupting the predicted activator motifs abolishes enhancer function, while silent or motif-improving changes maintain enhancer activity; (2) evolutionary conservation, nucleosome exclusion, binding of other factors, and strength of the motif match are predictive of enhancer activity; (3) scrambling repressor motifs leads to aberrant reporter expression in cell lines where the enhancers are usually inactive. Our results suggest a general strategy for deciphering cis-regulatory elements by systematic large-scale manipulation and provide quantitative enhancer activity measurements across thousands of constructs that can be mined to develop predictive models of gene expression.

10.1371/journal.pone.0059558  |  Treatment, Genetics, Drug Discovery  |  Drug Discovery, Treatment, Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Glioma initiating cells (GICs) are considered responsible for the therapeutic resistance and recurrence of malignant glioma. To clarify the molecular mechanism of GIC maintenance/differentiation, we established GIC clones having the potential to differentiate into malignant gliomas, and subjected to DNA microarray/iTRAQ based integrated proteomics. 21,857 mRNAs and 8,471 proteins were identified and integrated into a gene/protein expression analysis chart. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that the expression of cell adhesion molecules, including integrin subfamilies, such as α2 and αV, and extracellular matrices (ECMs), such as collagen IV (COL4), laminin α2 (LAMA2), and fibronectin 1 (FN), was significantly upregulated during serum-induced GIC differentiation. This differentiation process, accompanied by the upregulation of MAPK as well as glioma specific proteins in GICs, was dramatically accelerated in these ECM (especially FN)-coated dishes. Integrin αV blocking antibody and RGD peptide significantly suppressed early events in GIC differentiation, suggesting that the coupling of ECMs to integrin αV is necessary for GIC differentiation. In addition, the expression of integrin αV and its strong ligand FN was prominently increased in glioblastomas developed from mouse intracranial GIC xenografts. Interestingly, during the initial phase of GIC differentiation, the RGD treatment significantly inhibited GIC proliferation and raised their sensitivity against anti-cancer drug temozolomide (TMZ). We also found that combination treatments of TMZ and RGD inhibit glioma progression and lead the longer survival of mouse intracranial GIC xenograft model. These results indicate that GICs induce/secrete ECMs to develop microenvironments with serum factors, namely differentiation niches that further stimulate GIC differentiation and proliferation via the integrin recognition motif RGD. A combination of RGD treatment with TMZ could have the higher inhibitory potential against the glioma recurrence that may be regulated by the GICs in the differentiation niche. This study provides a new perspective for developing therapeutic strategies against the early onset of GIC-associated glioma.

  Patients and methods:  Between January 2008 and March 2012, 3041 patients underwent RARP at our institution by a single surgeon (V.P.). In all, 44 patients were considered morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥40 kg/m(2) . A propensity score-matched analysis was conducted using multivariable analysis to identify comparable groups of patients with a BMI of ≥40 and &lt;40 kg/m(2) . Perioperative, pathological outcomes and complications were compared between the two matched groups. 
  Results:  There was no significant difference in operative time. However, the mean estimated blood loss was higher in morbidly obese patients, at a mean (sd) of 113 (41) vs 130 (27) mL (P = 0.049). Anastomosis was more difficult in morbidly obese patients (P = 0.001). There were no significant differences in laterality, ease of nerve sparing, or transfusion rate between the groups. There were no intraoperative complications in either group. Postoperative pathological outcomes were similar between the groups. Differences in positive surgical margins and ease of nerve sparing approached statistical significance (P = 0.097, P = 0.075 respectively). Postoperative complication rates, pain scores, length of stay and indwelling catheter duration were similar in the groups. 
  Conclusions:  RARP in morbidly obese patients is technically demanding. However, it can be accomplished with acceptable morbidity and resource use. In the hands of an experienced surgeon, it is a safe procedure and offers beneficial clinical outcomes.

10.1016/j.eururo.2013.05.050  |  Robotics, Treatment  |  Treatment, Robotics  |  Stat  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Review  |    Background:  Robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with totally intracorporeal neobladder diversion is a complex procedure that has been reported with good outcomes in small series. 
  Objective:  To present complications and oncologic and functional outcomes of this procedure. 
  Design, setting, and participants:  Between 2003 and 2012 in a tertiary referral center, 70 patients were operated on by two experienced robotic surgeons. Data were collected prospectively and reviewed retrospectively. 
  Intervention:  RARC with totally intracorporeal modified Studer ileal neobladder formation. 
  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:  The overall outcome of RARC with a totally intracorporeal neobladder was presented by assessing (1) surgical margins, (2) recurrence or cancer-specific death at 24 mo, (3) 30-d and 90-d complications graded according to the modified Clavien-Dindo system, (4) daytime and nighttime continence (no or one pad per day) at 6 and 12 mo, and (5) satisfactory sexual activity or potency at 6 mo and 12 mo. Survival rates were estimated by Kaplan-Meier plots. 
  Results and limitations:  Median follow-up of the cohort was 30.3 mo (interquartile range: 12.7-35.6). We recorded negative margins in 69 of 70 patients (98.6%). Clavien 3-5 complications occurred in 22 of 70 patients (31.4%) at 30 d and 13 of 70 (18.6%) at &gt;30 d. At 90 d, the overall complication rate was 58.5%. Clavien &lt;3 and Clavien ≥3 complications were recorded in 15 of 70 patients (21.4%) and 26 of 70 (37.1%), respectively. Kaplan-Meier estimates for recurrence-free, cancer-specific, and overall survival at 24 mo were 80.7%, 88.9%, and 88.9%, respectively. Daytime continence and satisfactory sexual function or potency at 12 mo ranged between 70% and 90% in both men and women. Limitations of this study include its retrospective design, selection bias due to the learning curve phase, and missing data. 
  Conclusions:  In this expert center for RARC, outcomes after RARC with totally intracorporeal neobladder diversion appear satisfactory and in line with contemporary open series.

These peptides are known to act as preferred dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) substrates. Five casein-derived synthetic peptides (Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr, Leu-Pro-Leu-Pro-Leu, Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Tyr, Leu-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Tyr and Ile-Pro-Ile) and a casein (CasH), whey (WPH) and lactoferrin hydrolysate (LFH) generated with gastrointestinal enzymes were incubated with DPP-IV at 37 °C for 18 or 24h. Peptide breakdown was evident following incubation with DPP-IV. Different modes of DPP-IV inhibition were observed depending on the test compound. Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr, Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Tyr and Leu-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Tyr were substrate-, Leu-Pro-Leu-Pro-Leu and CasH were prodrug- while WPH and LFH were true DPP-IV inhibitors. These results are relevant for the bioactivity and bioavailability of functional foods targeting DPP-IV inhibition with potential blood glucose regulatory properties in humans.

10.1371/journal.pone.0079720  |  Diagnosis, Treatment, Genetics  |  Treatment, Genetics  |  Non-negativeMatrixFactorization  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   In the study of complex genetic diseases, the identification of subgroups of patients sharing similar genetic characteristics represents a challenging task, for example, to improve treatment decision. One type of genetic lesion, frequently investigated in such disorders, is the change of the DNA copy number (CN) at specific genomic traits. Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a standard technique to reduce the dimensionality of a data set and to cluster data samples, while keeping its most relevant information in meaningful components. Thus, it can be used to discover subgroups of patients from CN profiles. It is however computationally impractical for very high dimensional data, such as CN microarray data. Deciding the most suitable number of subgroups is also a challenging problem. The aim of this work is to derive a procedure to compact high dimensional data, in order to improve NMF applicability without compromising the quality of the clustering. This is particularly important for analyzing high-resolution microarray data. Many commonly used quality measures, as well as our own measures, are employed to decide the number of subgroups and to assess the quality of the results. Our measures are based on the idea of identifying robust subgroups, inspired by biologically/clinically relevance instead of simply aiming at well-separated clusters. We evaluate our procedure using four real independent data sets. In these data sets, our method was able to find accurate subgroups with individual molecular and clinical features and outperformed the standard NMF in terms of accuracy in the factorization fitness function. Hence, it can be useful for the discovery of subgroups of patients with similar CN profiles in the study of heterogeneous diseases.

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Removing of prostate for the treatment of localized prostate cancer is associated with a variable loss of erectile function due to injury of the nerves of erection during operation. Some researchers have reported that after nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy (RP), the natural recovery time of erectile function is at least 2 years. Factors such as thermal damage, ischaemic injury, mechanically induced nerve stretching and the local inflammatory effects of surgical trauma may also impair the cavernous nerves during RP. The concept of penile rehabilitation was first studied by Montorsi et al. in 1997. They showed that the use of any drug or device at or after RP could maximize the recovery of erectile function. Penile rehabilitation programmes (PRPs) with vasoactive agents, such as oral phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5Is), intraurethral and intracavernosal vasoactive agents, and vacuum erection devices (VEDs) can protect erectile tissue integrity and prevent corporal smooth muscle atrophy and diminish collagen formation. The present findings are consistent with previous reports that PRPs have a significant beneficial effect on early erectile function recovery and that preoperative erectile function is one of the important predictors of erectile function after RP. Patients can be referred for penile rehabilitation if they have any degree of erectile function (mild, moderate or normal) before operation. We also showed that the combination of PDE5Is and VEDs for PRPs offers the shortest erectile function recovery period. 
  Objective:  To define the optimal penile rehabilitation programme (PRP) based on preoperative Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) scores after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). 
  Patients and methods:  The medical records of 203 patients who underwent bilateral nerve-sparing RARP between 2007 and 2011 were reviewed for the present retrospective study. According to patients' preoperative erection status, group 1 (SHIM = 8-16), group 2 (SHIM = 17-21) and group 3 (SHIM = 22-25) were defined. After bilateral nerve-sparing RARP, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5Is), a vacuum erection device (VED), the combination of PDE5Is and a VED, or none of them were utilized by all patients for penile rehabilitation. Treatment success was defined as a rigid erection suitable for successful sexual intercourse. 
  Results:  The numbers of patients in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively, were 9, 22 and 73, and the mean erectile function recovery periods (EFRPs) were 15.44 ± 7.73, 12.31 ± 8.12 and 8.73 ± 5.67 months (P &lt; 0.05). Group 3 offered the best results for EFRP. Only PDE5Is or the combination of PDE5Is and VED use had a beneficial effect on EFRP (P &lt; 0.05). Using PDE5Is and VED together provided the best result, but there was no difference between PDE5Is and a VED (P ≥ 0.05). 
  Conclusions:  After bilateral nerve-sparing RARP, PRP with PDE5Is, including the combination of PDE5Is and VED, has a beneficial effect on erectile function recovery across all levels of baseline erectile function. Further large randomized control studies are needed to validate these findings.

10.1093/pcp/pct029  |  Genetics, Other  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Comprehensive genome-wide gene expression profiles during plant male gametogenesis have been thoroughly analyzed over the last decade. In contrast, gene expression profiles during female gametogenesis have been studied relatively little, and our knowledge concerning plant female gametogenesis is limited. We determined the genome-wide gene expression profiles of developing ovules containing female gametophytes from the megaspore mother cell at the pre-meiotic stage to the mature embryo sac in rice (Oryza sativa) using microarrays. In order to separate ovules from scutellum, we used a laser microdissection (LM) technique. Dynamic gene expression was revealed in developing ovules, and a major transition of the transcriptome was observed between middle and late meiotic stages, where many genes were down-regulated &gt;10-fold. Many potential players in female gametogenesis, that showed dynamic or enriched expression, were highlighted. We identified the temporal and dramatic up-regulation of a subset of transposable elements during female meiotic stages that were not observed in males. Transcription factor genes enriched in developing ovules were also uncovered, which may play crucial roles during female gametogenesis. This is the first report of comprehensive genome-wide gene expression profiles during female gametogenesis useful for plant reproductive studies. Combined with additional experiments, our data may provide important clues to understand female gametogenesis in plants.

10.1371/journal.pone.0065426  |  Genetics, Other  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  SET domain is responsible for the catalytic activity of histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTs) during developmental process. Histone lysine methylation plays a crucial and diverse regulatory function in chromatin organization and genome function. Although several SET genes have been identified and characterized in plants, the understanding of OsSET gene family in rice is still very limited. 
  Methodology/principal findings:  In this study, a systematic analysis was performed and revealed the presence of at least 43 SET genes in rice genome. Phylogenetic and structural analysis grouped SET proteins into five classes, and supposed that the domains out of SET domain were significant for the specific of histone lysine methylation, as well as the recognition of methylated histone lysine. Based on the global microarray, gene expression profile revealed that the transcripts of OsSET genes were accumulated differentially during vegetative and reproductive developmental stages and preferentially up or down-regulated in different tissues. Cis-elements identification, co-expression analysis and GO analysis of expression correlation of 12 OsSET genes suggested that OsSET genes might be involved in cell cycle regulation and feedback. 
  Conclusions/significance:  This study will facilitate further studies on OsSET family and provide useful clues for functional validation of OsSETs.

10.1371/journal.pone.0061820  |  Genetics, Other  |  Treatment, Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  The sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), is one of the most widely distributed agricultural pests. Although it has developed resistance to many registered insecticides including the neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam, the mechanisms that regulate the resistance are poorly understood. To understand the molecular basis of thiamethoxam resistance, "omics" analyses were carried out to examine differences between resistant and susceptible B. tabaci at both transcriptional and translational levels. 
  Results:  A total of 1,338 mRNAs and 52 proteins were differentially expressed between resistant and susceptible B. tabaci. Among them, 11 transcripts had concurrent transcription and translation profiles. KEGG analysis mapped 318 and 35 differentially expressed genes and proteins, respectively, to 160 and 59 pathways (p&lt;0.05). Thiamethoxam treatment activated metabolic pathways (e.g., drug metabolism), in which 118 transcripts were putatively linked to insecticide resistance, including up-regulated glutathione-S-transferase, UDP glucuronosyltransferase, glucosyl/glucuronosyl transferase, and cytochrome P450. Gene Ontology analysis placed these genes and proteins into protein complex, metabolic process, cellular process, signaling, and response to stimulus categories. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis validated "omics" response, and suggested a highly overexpressed P450, CYP6CX1, as a candidate molecular basis for the mechanistic study of thiamethoxam resistance in whiteflies. Finally, enzymatic activity assays showed elevated detoxification activities in the resistant B. tabaci. 
  Conclusions:  This study demonstrates the applicability of high-throughput omics tools for identifying molecular candidates related to thiamethoxam resistance in an agricultural important insect pest. In addition, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses provide a solid foundation for future functional investigations into the complex molecular mechanisms governing the neonicotinoid resistance in whiteflies.

Recently, microRNAs (miRNA) have been identified as critical regulators of osteogenic differentiation. This study aimed to identify specific miRNAs and their regulatory roles in the process of Satb2-induced osteogenic differentiation. We studied the differentially expressed miRNAs by Satb2 overexpression in murine bone marrow stromal cells using miRNA microarray. Ten down-regulated miRNAs including miR-27a, miR-125a-5p, and miR-466f-3p, and 18 up-regulated miRNAs including miR-17, miR-20a and miR-210 were found to be differentially expressed and their expression were verified by quantitative real time PCR. The differentially expressed miRNAs were further subjected to gene ontology and KEGG analysis. The highly enriched GOs and KEGG pathway showed target genes of these miRNAs were significantly involved in multiple biological processes (mesenchymal cell differentiation, bone formation, and skeletal development), and several osteogenic pathways (TGF-β/BMP, MAPK, and Wnt signaling pathway). Finally, miR-27a was selected for target verification and function analysis. BMP2, BMPR1A, and Smad9, members of the TGF-β/BMP superfamily, which were predicted to be target genes of miR-27a, were confirmed to be significantly up-regulated in Satb2-overexpressing cells by quantitative real time PCR. Overexpression of miR-27a significantly inhibited osteogenesis and repressed BMP2, BMPR1A, and Smad9 expression. In this study, we identified that a number of differentially regulated miRNAs, whose target genes involved in the TGF-β/BMP signaling pathway, play an important role in the early stage of Satb2-induced osteogenic differentiation.

  Materials and methods:  We performed a thorough MEDLINE literature review using a combination of the following keywords: urothelial carcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma, bladder, renal pelvis, ureter, predictive tools, predictive models and nomograms. We found 117 articles, but only the relevant reports were selected. 
  Results:  The majority of available tools are prediction models, particularly nomograms. These models combine good performance accuracy with ease of use. They appear to be more accurate than risk grouping or tree modeling and are more suitable for clinicians than artificial intelligence. The most recent nomograms have been designed to be used in daily clinical practice and are even available as computer or smartphone applications. They focus on pathological outcomes or more frequently on survival statistics or recurrence risk after surgery. They provide an accurate prediction of disease evolution and may help clinicians to choose the most appropriate treatment option. However, these prediction tools still need to be validated and regularly utilized. 
  Conclusion:  Predictive tools represent very helpful clinical decision-making aids but need to be validated in larger populations.

10.1101/gr.137091.111  |  Prognosis, Genetics  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Genetics  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Recent genome-wide computational screens that search for conservation of RNA secondary structure in whole-genome alignments (WGAs) have predicted thousands of structural noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). The sensitivity of such approaches, however, is limited, due to their reliance on sequence-based whole-genome aligners, which regularly misalign structural ncRNAs. This suggests that many more structural ncRNAs may remain undetected. Structure-based alignment, which could increase the sensitivity, has been prohibitive for genome-wide screens due to its extreme computational costs. Breaking this barrier, we present the pipeline REAPR (RE-Alignment for Prediction of structural ncRNA), which efficiently realigns whole genomes based on RNA sequence and structure, thus allowing us to boost the performance of de novo ncRNA predictors, such as RNAz. Key to the pipeline's efficiency is the development of a novel banding technique for multiple RNA alignment. REAPR significantly outperforms the widely used predictors RNAz and EvoFold in genome-wide screens; in direct comparison to the most recent RNAz screen on D. melanogaster, REAPR predicts twice as many high-confidence ncRNA candidates. Moreover, modENCODE RNA-seq experiments confirm a substantial number of its predictions as transcripts. REAPR's advancement of de novo structural characterization of ncRNAs complements the identification of transcripts from rapidly accumulating RNA-seq data.

10.1121/1.4819248  |  Other  |  None, Other  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Review  |   This paper is an outcome of a workshop that addressed the question how soundscape research can improve its impact on the local level. It addresses a number of topics by complementing existing approaches and practices with possible future approaches and practices. The paper starts with an analysis of the role of sound annoyance and suboptimal soundscapes on the lives of individuals and concludes that a good soundscape, or more generally a good sensescape, is at the same time pleasant as well as conducive for the adoption of healthy habits. To maintain or improve sensescape quality, urban planning needs improved design tools that allow for a more holistic optimization and an active role of the local stakeholders. Associated with this is a gradual development from government to governance in which optimization of the soundscape at a local (administrative or geographic) level is directly influenced by the users of spaces. The paper concludes that soundscape research can have a greater impact by helping urban planners design for health and pleasant experiences as well as developing tools for improved citizen involvement in local optimization.

The powerful neural representations found in Inferotemporal cortex form a remarkably rapid and robust basis for object recognition which belies the difficulties faced by the system when learning in natural visual environments. A central issue in understanding the process of biological object recognition is how these neurons learn to form separate representations of objects from complex visual scenes composed of multiple objects. We show how a one-layer competitive network comprised of 'spiking' neurons is able to learn separate transformation-invariant representations (exemplified by one-dimensional translations) of visual objects that are always seen together moving in lock-step, but separated in space. This is achieved by combining 'Mexican hat' functional lateral connectivity with cell firing-rate adaptation to temporally segment input representations of competing stimuli through anti-phase oscillations (perceptual cycles). These spiking dynamics are quickly and reliably generated, enabling selective modification of the feed-forward connections to neurons in the next layer through Spike-Time-Dependent Plasticity (STDP), resulting in separate translation-invariant representations of each stimulus. Variations in key properties of the model are investigated with respect to the network's ability to develop appropriate input representations and subsequently output representations through STDP. Contrary to earlier rate-coded models of this learning process, this work shows how spiking neural networks may learn about more than one stimulus together without suffering from the 'superposition catastrophe'. We take these results to suggest that spiking dynamics are key to understanding biological visual object recognition.

Participatory environmental sensing, i.e. directly involving citizens in environmental monitoring, is one example, which is hoped to encourage learning and enhance awareness of environmental issues. In this paper, an analysis of the behaviour of individuals involved in noise sensing is presented. Citizens have been involved in noise measuring activities through the WideNoise smartphone application. This application has been designed to record both objective (noise samples) and subjective (opinions, feelings) data. The application has been open to be used freely by anyone and has been widely employed worldwide. In addition, several test cases have been organised in European countries. Based on the information submitted by users, an analysis of emerging awareness and learning is performed. The data show that changes in the way the environment is perceived after repeated usage of the application do appear. Specifically, users learn how to recognise different noise levels they are exposed to. Additionally, the subjective data collected indicate an increased user involvement in time and a categorisation effect between pleasant and less pleasant environments.

10.1007/978-3-319-02126-3_3  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   We present an analysis framework for large studies of multimodal clinical quality brain image collections. Processing and analysis of such datasets is challenging due to low resolution, poor contrast, mis-aligned images, and restricted field of view. We adapt existing registration and segmentation methods and build a computational pipeline for spatial normalization and feature extraction. The resulting aligned dataset enables clinically meaningful analysis of spatial distributions of relevant anatomical features and of their evolution with age and disease progression. We demonstrate the approach on a neuroimaging study of stroke with more than 800 patients. We show that by combining data from several modalities, we can automatically segment important biomarkers such as white matter hyperintensity and characterize pathology evolution in this heterogeneous cohort. Specifically, we examine two sub-populations with different dynamics of white matter hyperintensity changes as a function of patients' age. Pipeline and analysis code is available at http://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/medical-vision/stroke/.

10.1104/pp.113.221895  |  Genetics, Other  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Low red light/far-red light ratio (R:FR) serves as an indicator of impending competition and has been demonstrated to suppress branch development. The regulation of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) rosette bud outgrowth by the R:FR and the associated mechanisms were investigated at several levels. Growth under low R:FR suppressed outgrowth of the third from topmost bud (bud n-2) but not that of the topmost bud. Subsequently increasing the R:FR near the time of anthesis promoted bud n-2 outgrowth and reduced topmost bud growth. Buds from specific rosette positions, exhibiting divergent fates to increased R:FR, were harvested 3 h after modifying the R:FR and were used to conduct ATH1 microarray-based transcriptome profiling. Differentially expressed genes showed enrichment of light signaling and hormone-related Gene Ontology terms and promoter motifs, most notably those associated with abscisic acid (ABA). Genes associated with ABA biosynthesis, including the key biosynthetic gene NINE-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE3 (NCED3), and with ABA signaling were expressed at higher levels in the responsive bud n-2, and increasing the R:FR decreased their expression only in bud n-2. ABA abundance in responsive buds decreased within 12 h of increasing the R:FR, while indole-3-acetic acid levels did not change. A role for ABA in repressing bud outgrowth from lower positions under low R:FR was demonstrated using the nced3-2 and aba2-1 ABA biosynthesis mutants, which showed enhanced branching and a defective bud n-2 outgrowth response to low R:FR. The results provide evidence that ABA regulates bud outgrowth responses to the R:FR and thus extend the known hormonal pathways associated with the regulation of branching and shade avoidance.

10.1093/nar/gkt1249  |  Genetics, Other  |  None, Other  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Recent advances in technology have led to a dramatic increase in the number of available transcription factor ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip data sets. Understanding the motif content of these data sets is an important step in understanding the underlying mechanisms of regulation. Here we provide a systematic motif analysis for 427 human ChIP-seq data sets using motifs curated from the literature and also discovered de novo using five established motif discovery tools. We use a systematic pipeline for calculating motif enrichment in each data set, providing a principled way for choosing between motif variants found in the literature and for flagging potentially problematic data sets. Our analysis confirms the known specificity of 41 of the 56 analyzed factor groups and reveals motifs of potential cofactors. We also use cell type-specific binding to find factors active in specific conditions. The resource we provide is accessible both for browsing a small number of factors and for performing large-scale systematic analyses. We provide motif matrices, instances and enrichments in each of the ENCODE data sets. The motifs discovered here have been used in parallel studies to validate the specificity of antibodies, understand cooperativity between data sets and measure the variation of motif binding across individuals and species.

10.1186/1479-5876-11-239  |  Diagnosis, Genetics  |  None, Other  |  Stat  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  The incidence and mortality of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is higher in African Americans (AA) than other racial/ethnic groups in the U.S., but the reasons for this disparity are unknown. There is an urgent need for the discovery of novel molecular signatures for HCV disease progression to understand the underlying biological basis for this cancer rate disparity to improve the clinical outcome. 
  Methods:  We performed differential proteomics with isobaric labeling tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) and MS/MS analysis to identify proteins differentially expressed in cirrhotic (CIR) and HCC as compared to normal tissues of Caucasian American (CA) patients. The raw data were analyzed using the ProteinPilot v3.0. Searches were performed against all known sequences populating the Swiss-Prot, Refseq, and TrEMBL databases. Quality control analyses were accomplished using pairwise correlation plots, boxplots, principal component analysis, and unsupervised hierarchical clustering. Supervised analysis was carried out to identify differentially expressed proteins. Candidates were validated in independent cohorts of CA and AA tissues by qRT-PCR or Western blotting. 
  Results:  A total of 238 unique proteins were identified. Of those, around 15% were differentially expressed between normal, CIR &amp; HCC groups. Target validation demonstrates racially distinct alteration in the expression of certain proteins. For example, the mRNA expression levels of transferrin (TF) were 2 and18-fold higher in CIR and HCC in AA as compared to CA. Similarly; the expression of Apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1) was 7-fold higher in HCC of AA. This increase was mirrored in the protein expression levels. Interestingly, the level of hepatocyte nuclear factor4a (HNF4a) protein was down regulated in AA, whereas repression of transcription is seen more in CA compared to AA. These data suggest that racial disparities in HCC could be a consequence of differential dysregulation of HNF4a transcriptional activity. 
  Conclusion:  This study identifies novel molecular signatures in HCV-induced HCC using iTRAQ-based tissue proteomics. The proteins identified will further enhance a molecular explanation to the biochemical mechanism(s) that may play a role in HCC racial disparities.

However, current studies only use conventional regression models to discover predictors of albuminuria. We have used 2 different statistical models to predict albuminuria in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a multilayer perception neural network and a conditional logistic regression. Neural network models were used to predict the level of albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, which include a matched case-control study for the population. For each case, we randomly selected 1 control matched by age and body mass index (BMI). The input variables were sex, duration of diabetes, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein/triglyceride ratio, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, and glycated hemoglobin. Age and BMI were included only in the neural network model. This model included 4 hidden layers and 1 bias. Relative error of predictions was 0.38% in the training group, 0.52% in the testing group, and 1.20% in the holdout group. The most robust predictors of albuminuria were high-density lipoprotein (21%), cholesterol (14.4%), and systolic blood pressure (9.7%). Using the conditional logistic regression model, glomerular filtration rate, time of onset to diabetes, and sex were significant indicators in the onset of albuminuria. Using a neural network model, we show that high-density lipoprotein is the most important factor in predicting albuminuria in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Our neural network model complements the current risk factor models to improve the care of patients with diabetes.

10.1016/j.urology.2013.05.013  |  Robotics  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Robotics  |  LinearRegression, LogisticRegression  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Objective:  To evaluate the operative and pathologic outcomes of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in men with progressive changes in body mass index (BMI) category. 
  Materials and methods:  A single-surgeon series of 1023 laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (mostly extraperitoneal) patients was considered. Of these patients, 987 were evaluable. Results were stratified by the World Health Organization BMI category. Multivariate linear and logistic regression analysis was used to model the operating time, length of stay, positive surgical margins, and noncurable cancer. 
  Results:  Of the 987 patients, 563 (57%) were overweight and 193 (19.6%) were obese. Of the 193 obese patients, 152 (15.4%) had a BMI of 30 to &lt;35 kg/m(2) (class I obesity), 28 (2.8%) a BMI of 35 to &lt;40 kg/m(2) (class II), and 13 (1.3%) a BMI of ≥40 kg/m(2) (class III). No differences were found in the estimated blood loss, complications, PSM, pathologic stage, or biochemical recurrence across the BMI categories (6-month median follow-up). However, pelvic lymph node dissection was more commonly omitted and the nerve-sparing score was inferior in the obese men. On multivariate analysis, a higher BMI was a significant predictor of a longer operating time. 
  Conclusion:  Obese men can safely undergo laparoscopic radical prostatectomy or robot-assisted radical prostatectomy, although the ability to perform excellent nerve sparing appears to decrease with increasing obesity. Nevertheless, obese men can expect perioperative and early oncologic outcomes comparable to those of normal weight men without an increased risk of perioperative complications.

These arrays also represent a new opportunity to profile protein expression levels in cancer patients' samples and to identify useful biosignatures for clinical diagnosis, disease classification, prediction, drug development and patient care. We applied antibody arrays to discover a panel of proteins which may serve as biomarkers to distinguish between patients with ovarian cancer and normal controls. 
  Methodology/principal findings:  Using a case-control study design of 34 ovarian cancer patients and 53 age-matched healthy controls, we profiled the expression levels of 174 proteins using antibody array technology and determined the CA125 level using ELISA. The expression levels of those proteins were analyzed using 3 discriminant methods, including artificial neural network, classification tree and split-point score analysis. A panel of 5 serum protein markers (MSP-alpha, TIMP-4, PDGF-R alpha, and OPG and CA125) was identified, which could effectively detect ovarian cancer with high specificity (95%) and high sensitivity (100%), with AUC =0.98, while CA125 alone had an AUC of 0.87. 
  Conclusions/significance:  Our pilot study has shown the promising set of 5 serum markers for ovarian cancer detection.

  Methods and materials:  Hypoxia-inducible oncogenes were identified by complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) microarray and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis in order to investigate gene ontology and functional pathways and networks. siRNA was used to knockdown the Vav3 target gene and analyze the effects on proliferation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis of LNCaP/CH cells. Vav3 cDNA was transfected into LNCaP cells under normoxia (LNCaP/N) to establish Vav3-overexpressing clonal cell lines, whose proliferation, invasion, and migration was then examined. Immunoblot analysis was used to investigate the activation of Akt, a Vav3 downstream target molecule. 
  Results:  cDNA microarray analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified Vav3 as a hypoxia-inducible oncogene that was highly associated with malignant behavior. Vav3 messenger RNA and protein expression in LNCaP/CH cells were higher than in LNCaP/N and LNCaP cells cultured under acute hypoxia (LNCaP/AH). The growth rate of LNCaP/CH cells was lower than that of LNCaP/N cells but higher than that of LNCaP/AH cells. LNCaP/CH cells showed higher invasion and migration than LNCaP/N and LNCaP/AH cells. Interrupting Vav3 expression strongly suppressed the proliferation, invasion, and migration of LNCaP/CH cells. Furthermore, siRNA led to apoptosis with increased caspase-3 and cleaved poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase activation in LNCaP/CH cells. Stable Vav3 overexpression in LNCaP cells promoted cell proliferation, invasion, and migration with Akt activation. 
  Conclusions:  Our results demonstrate that Vav3 plays a crucial role in prostate cancer growth and malignant behavior, thus revealing a novel potential therapeutic target.

10.1210/jc.2013-1583  |  Robotics  |  Robotics  |  Stat  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Objectives:  Robotic total thyroidectomy (TT) with modified radical neck dissection (MRND) using a gasless transaxillary approach has been reported safe and effective in patients with N1b papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), with notable cosmetic benefits when compared with conventional open TT. We have compared oncological outcomes and quality of life (QoL) in PTC patients undergoing robotic TT and MRND and those undergoing conventional open procedures. 
  Materials and methods:  Between March 2010 and July 2011, 128 patients with PTC and lateral neck node metastases underwent TT with MRND, including 62 who underwent robotic and 66 who underwent open TT. We compared oncologic outcomes and safety as well as functional outcomes such as postoperative subjective voice and swallowing difficulties. We also evaluated neck pain, sensory changes, and cosmetic satisfaction after surgery using various QoL symptom scales. Neck and shoulder disability was assessed using arm abduction tests (AAT) and questions from the neck dissection impairment index (NDII). 
  Results:  Although the mean operating time was significantly longer in the robotic (mean, 271.8 ± 50.2 min) than in the open group (mean, 208.9 ± 56.3 min) (P &lt; .0001), postoperative complication rates and oncologic outcomes, including the results of radioactive iodine scans and postoperative serum Tg concentrations, did not differ significantly. Subjective voice outcomes and postoperative AAT and neck dissection impairment index were also similar, but postoperative swallowing difficulties (P = .0041) and sensory changes (P &lt; .0001) were significantly more frequent in the open than in the robotic group. In particular, mean cosmetic satisfaction score was significantly higher in the robotic than in the open group (P &lt; .0001). 
  Conclusions:  Robotic TT with MRND yielded similar oncologic outcomes and safety as conventional open procedures, with similar recovery of neck and shoulder disability. However, the robot technique resulted in better QoL outcomes, including better cosmetic results and reductions in neck sensory changes and swallowing discomfort.

10.1007/s00204-013-1091-8  |  Genetics  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   A number of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes are present in food both as natural constituents and as flavouring agents. Their reaction with DNA due to their electrophilic α,β-unsaturated aldehyde moiety may result in genotoxicity as observed in some in vitro models, thereby raising a safety concern. A question that remains is whether in vivo detoxification would be efficient enough to prevent DNA adduct formation and genotoxicity. In this study, a human physiologically based kinetic/dynamic (PBK/D) model of trans-2-hexenal (2-hexenal), a selected model α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, was developed to examine dose-dependent detoxification and DNA adduct formation in humans upon dietary exposure. The kinetic model parameters for detoxification were quantified using relevant pooled human tissue fractions as well as tissue fractions from 11 different individual subjects. In addition, a Monte Carlo simulation was performed so that the impact of interindividual variation in 2-hexenal detoxification on the DNA adduct formation in the population as a whole could be examined. The PBK/D model revealed that DNA adduct formation due to 2-hexenal exposure was 0.039 adducts/10⁸ nucleotides (nt) at the estimated average 2-hexenal dietary intake (0.04 mg 2-hexenal/kg bw) and 0.18 adducts/10⁸ nt at the 95th percentile of the dietary intake (0.178 mg 2-hexenal/kg bw) in the most sensitive people. These levels are three orders of magnitude lower than natural background DNA adduct levels that have been reported in disease-free humans (6.8-110 adducts/10⁸ nt), suggesting that the genotoxicity risk for the human population at realistic dietary daily intakes of 2-hexenal may be negligible.

10.5858/arpa.2011-0550-OA  |  Robotics, Genetics  |  Robotics, Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Context:  Recently, robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy has replaced open retropubic radical prostatectomy as the surgical procedure of choice. This less-invasive approach offers many advantages but exposes prostate tissue to longer periods of warm ischemia that may affect subsequent analysis of biomarkers. 
  Objective:  To analyze the nucleic acid quality and quantity isolated from open versus laparoscopic prostatectomies. 
  Design:  Nucleic acids were isolated from 10 open-obtained and 10 laparoscopic-obtained tissues stored in our prostate sample repository. Nucleic acid integrity was assessed via electrophoresis and polymerase chain reaction amplification of RNA and DNA targets ranging in size from 125 to 939 base pairs. 
  Results:  The DNA yield, integrity, and polymerase chain reaction amplification were identical between samples obtained from both surgical approaches. The RNA integrity number and yield were similar, as was β-2 microglobulin mRNA amplification up to 652 base pairs. However, 2 of 10 samples (20%) collected robotically showed decreased real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification of prostate-specific antigen messenger RNA, especially with targets larger than 300 base pairs. 
  Conclusions:  Generally, the quality and quantity of nucleic acids isolated from prostate tissue obtained via open or laparoscopic approaches are equivalent, suggesting that procurement of tissues is appropriate from either procedure. However, some loss of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification of larger RNA targets was noted in the laparoscopic samples; appropriate design of assays to keep amplicon sizes small and the use of internal controls to assess RNA integrity is recommended.

However, the safety and efficacy of this minimally invasive procedure have not been established in large series. 
  Methods:  From October 2009 to September 2012, 307 consecutive robotic-assisted coronary artery bypass grafting procedures were performed at a single US institution by 2 surgeons. Isolated, off-pump, left internal thoracic artery to left anterior descending coronary artery grafting was planned via a 3- to 4-cm non-rib-spreading minithoracotomy after robotic left internal thoracic artery harvest in all patients. Hybrid coronary revascularization was planned in 159 patients (51.8%). Of the 199 angiograms (64.8%) performed before discharge, 63 were performed as completion angiograms in a hybrid suite immediately after left internal thoracic artery-left anterior descending artery grafting. 
  Results:  Thirty-day mortality occurred in 4 patients (1.3%), conversion to sternotomy occurred in 16 patients (5.2%), postoperative myocardial infarction occurred in 5 patients (1.6%), and reexploration for bleeding occurred in 7 patients (2.3%). There was 1 (0.3%) postoperative stroke. For the 199 patients with follow-up angiography before discharge, the left internal thoracic artery was confirmed to be patent (&lt;50% stenosis) in 189 patients (95.0%). Among the 10 patients with significant (≥50% stenosis) defects, 5 had graft occlusion or distal left anterior descending occlusion, 2 had poor flow distal to the anastomosis, and 3 had anastomotic lesions (≥50% stenosis). Among the 63 patients with intraoperative completion angiography, 5 patients underwent surgical graft revision, 3 patients underwent minithoracotomy, and 2 patients underwent conversion to sternotomy. 
  Conclusions:  Robotic-assisted coronary artery bypass grafting is an effective alternative to traditional coronary artery bypass grafting for patients with single or multivessel coronary artery disease, with comparable short-term clinical and angiographic results.

Three-minute MEG time series were band-passed and subjected to blind source separation (BSS) prior to estimating sensor interdependencies using the weighted phase synchronization measure (wPLI). Dynamic sensor-level network properties were then derived for two network metrics (global and local efficiency). The temporal decay of long-range temporal correlations in network metrics (LRTC) was quantified using the scaling exponent (SE) in detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) plots. Having established the reliability of SE estimates as robust descriptors of network dynamics, we found that RD students displayed significantly reduced (a) overall sensor-level network organization across all frequency bands (global efficiency), and (b) temporal correlations between sensors covering the left temporoparietal region and the remaining sensors in the β3 band (local efficiency). Importantly, both groups displayed scale-free global network connectivity dynamics. The direct application of DFA to MEG signals failed to reveal significant group differences. Results are discussed in relation to prior evidence for disrupted temporoparietal functional circuits for reading in developmental reading disability.

10.1037/a0035146  |  Other  |  Diagnosis  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Temporal integration is the perceptual process combining sensory stimulation over time into longer percepts that can span over 10 times the duration of a minimally detectable stimulus. Particularly in the auditory domain, such "long-term" temporal integration has been characterized as a relatively simple function that acts chiefly to bridge brief input gaps, and which places integrated stimuli on temporal coordinates while preserving their temporal order information. These properties are not observed in visual temporal integration, suggesting they might be modality specific. The present study challenges that view. Participants were presented with rapid series of successive tone stimuli, in which two separate, deviant target tones were to be identified. Critically, the target tone pair would be perceived as a single synthetic vowel if they were interpreted to be simultaneous. During the task, despite that the targets were always sequential and never actually overlapping, listeners frequently reported hearing just one sound, the synthetic vowel, rather than two successive tones. The results demonstrate that auditory temporal integration, like its visual counterpart, truly assembles a percept from sensory inputs across time, and does not just summate time-ordered (identical) inputs or fill gaps therein. This finding supports the idea that temporal integration is a universal function of the human perceptual system.

10.1177/2211068213513453  |  Drug Discovery, Genetics  |  Drug Discovery, Treatment, Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Current antiretroviral treatments target multiple pathways important for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) multiplication, including viral entry, synthesis and integration of the DNA provirus, and the processing of viral polyprotein precursors. However, HIV is becoming increasingly resistant to these "combination therapies." Recent findings show that inhibition of HIV Gag protein cleavage into its two structural proteins, matrix (MA) and capsid (CA), has a devastating effect on viral production, revealing a potential new target class for HIV treatment. Unlike the widely used HIV protease inhibitors, this new class of inhibitor would target the substrate, not the protease enzyme itself. This approach offers a distinct advantage in that inhibitors of MA/CA would only need to affect a subset of the Gag molecules to disable viral replication. To discover MA/CA-specific inhibitors, we constructed a modified MA/CA fusion peptide (MA/CAΔ) that contains the HIV protease (PR) cleavage site as well as a tetracysteine motif for fluorescent labeling. The HIV PR cleavage of MA/CAΔ can then be monitored via fluorescence polarization (FP). We have adapted this FP assay for high-throughput screening and validated it according to industry standards using a 384-well plate format. We have currently tested 24,000 compounds in this assay and here detail the screening methodology and the results of this screening campaign.

10.1371/journal.pone.0068385  |  Genetics, Other  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   It is widely accepted that long-term changes in synapse structure and function are mediated by rapid activity-dependent gene transcription and new protein synthesis. A growing amount of evidence suggests that the microRNA (miRNA) pathway plays an important role in coordinating these processes. Despite recent advances in this field, there remains a critical need to identify specific activity-regulated miRNAs as well as their key messenger RNA (mRNA) targets. To address these questions, we used the larval Drosophila melanogaster neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a model synapse in which to identify novel miRNA-mediated mechanisms that control activity-dependent synaptic growth. First, we developed a screen to identify miRNAs differentially regulated in the larval CNS following spaced synaptic stimulation. Surprisingly, we identified five miRNAs (miRs-1, -8, -289, -314, and -958) that were significantly downregulated by activity. Neuronal misexpression of three miRNAs (miRs-8, -289, and -958) suppressed activity-dependent synaptic growth suggesting that these miRNAs control the translation of biologically relevant target mRNAs. Functional annotation cluster analysis revealed that putative targets of miRs-8 and -289 are significantly enriched in clusters involved in the control of neuronal processes including axon development, pathfinding, and growth. In support of this, miR-8 regulated the expression of a wingless 3'UTR (wg 3' untranslated region) reporter in vitro. Wg is an important presynaptic regulatory protein required for activity-dependent axon terminal growth at the fly NMJ. In conclusion, our results are consistent with a model where key activity-regulated miRNAs are required to coordinate the expression of genes involved in activity-dependent synaptogenesis.

10.1016/j.pain.2013.08.023  |  Drug Discovery  |  Drug Discovery  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Neuronal plasticity in the pain-processing pathway is thought to be a mechanism underlying pain hypersensitivity and negative emotions occurring during a pain state. Recent evidence suggests that the activation of astrocytes in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) contributes to the development of negative emotions during pain hypersensitivity after peripheral inflammation. However, it is unknown whether these activated astrocytes contribute to neuronal plasticity in the ACC. In this study, by using optical imaging with voltage- and Ca(2+)-sensitive dyes, we examined the long-term facilitation of neuronal excitation induced by high-frequency conditioning stimulation (HFS) in ACC slices of control mice and mice with peripheral inflammation induced by the injection of complete Freund adjuvant (CFA) to the hind paw. Immunoreactivity of glial fibrillary acidic protein in laminae II-III of the ACC in the CFA-injected mice was higher than in the control mice. Neuronal excitation in ACC slices from the CFA-injected mice was gradually increased by HFS, and the magnitude of this long-term facilitation was greater than in the control mice. The long-term facilitation in the CFA-injected mice was inhibited by the astroglial toxin, the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist and NMDA receptor glycine binding site antagonist. The increase of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration in astrocytes during HFS was higher in the CFA-injected mice than in the control mice and was inhibited by l-α-aminoadipate (l-α-AA). These results suggest that the activation of astrocytes in the ACC plays a crucial role in the development of negative emotions and LTP during pain hypersensitivity after peripheral inflammation.

The surface of the bacterium consists of three distinctive membranes: plasmatic, cellular and the polysaccharide (PS) capsule. PS capsules may mediate several biological processes, particularly invasive infections of human beings. Prevention against pneumococcal related illnesses can be provided by vaccines. There is a sound investment worldwide in the investigation of a proteic antigen as a possible alternative to pneumococcal vaccines based exclusively on PS. A few proteins which are part of the membrane of the pneumococcus seem to have antigen potential to be part of a vaccine, particularly the PspA. A vital aspect in the production of the intended conjugate pneumococcal vaccine is the efficient production (in industrial scale) of both, the chosen PS serotypes as well as the PspA protein. Growing recombinant Escherichia coli (rE. coli) in high-cell density cultures (HCDC) under a fed-batch regime requires a refined continuous control over various process variables where the on-line prediction of the feeding phase is of particular relevance and one of the focuses of this paper. The viability of an on-line monitoring software system, based on constructive neural networks (CoNN), for automatically detecting the time to start the fed-phase of a HCDC of rE. coli that contains a plasmid used for PspA expression is investigated. The paper describes the data and methodology used for training five different types of CoNNs, four of them suitable for classification tasks and one suitable for regression tasks, aiming at comparatively investigate both approaches. Results of software simulations implementing five CoNN algorithms as well as conventional neural networks (FFNN), decision trees (DT) and support vector machines (SVM) are also presented and discussed. A modified CasCor algorithm, implementing a data softening process, has shown to be an efficient candidate to be part of an on-line HCDC monitoring system for detecting the feeding phase of the HCDC process.

10.1016/j.ejso.2013.03.007  |  Robotics  |  Diagnosis, Robotics  |  Stat  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Objective:  To assess operative and pathological results obtained after robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) in renal masses over 4 cm. 
  Patients and methods:  Between 2007 and 2011, 220 robotic nephron-sparing surgeries (NSS) were performed at six French urology departments. Data were prospectively collected: age, BMI, pre and post-operative eGFR (MDRD), operative time (OT), warm ischemia time (WIT), estimated blood loss (EBL), length of hospital stay (LOS), Clavien complications, pathological results and oncologic outcome. Tumor complexity was assessed according to the RENAL nephrometry score. 
  Results:  Overall, 54 tumors were included. Median follow up was 26 months. Median age at surgery was 62 years. Median RENAL nephrometry score was 7 (4-10). Median WIT was 23 min (10-59). Median OT and EBL were 180 min (110-425) and 100 cc (0-2500). Blood transfusion occurred in 7 cases (13%). Median tumor size was 45 mm (40-70). Three patients had positive surgical margins. Median LOS was 5 days (2-28). Nine patients presented post-operative complications of which 1/3 were considered as major (Clavien IIIb). Median pre-operative and post-operative eGFR was 88 (36-136) and 75 ml/min (33-122) (p = 0.01), respectively. Two patients developed subsequent metastasis. The 2-year progression free survival (PFS) rate was 90.5%. 
  Conclusion:  Our results confirm that RAPN is a useful and acceptable approach for renal masses greater than 4 cm in size. When technically possible, NSS provides promising short-term cancer-specific survival rates with acceptable morbidity. Tumor size is not sufficiently discriminant enough and RENAL nephrometry score should increasingly used to describe tumor complexity.

Here, we report the generation and characterization of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from monozygotic twins discordant for trisomy 21 in order to eliminate the effects of the variability of genomic background. The alterations observed by genetic analysis at the iPSC level and at first approximation in early development illustrate the developmental disease transcriptional signature of Down syndrome. Moreover, we observed an abnormal neural differentiation of Down syndrome iPSCs in vivo when formed teratoma in NOD-SCID mice, and in vitro when differentiated into neuroprogenitors and neurons. These defects were associated with changes in the architecture and density of neurons, astroglial and oligodendroglial cells together with misexpression of genes involved in neurogenesis, lineage specification and differentiation. Furthermore, we provide novel evidence that dual-specificity tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) on chromosome 21 likely contributes to these defects. Importantly, we found that targeting DYRK1A pharmacologically or by shRNA results in a considerable correction of these defects.

  Material and methods:  Diagnostic work-up of 1320 patients who underwent surgical exploration due to an adnexal mass at a tertiary referral center were included. We assessed the discriminative value of pattern recognition, a sonographic morphological scoring system, RMI and CA 125 by calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and Cohen's kappa for each diagnostic approach while using histopathology as the reference standard. 
  Results:  Pattern recognition showed the highest discriminative power with an observed kappa of 0.53. Sensitivity and specificity yielded 0.76 and 0.97 respectively. Combining pattern recognition with CA 125 serum measurement in the context of a triage system diminished the diagnostic value (kappa: 0.24; sensitivity: 0.29 specificity: 0.97). For the RMI we observed a sensitivity of 0.54 and a specificity of 0.96 and estimated kappa value yielded 0.37. Omitting the CA 125 assay and using a morphological sonographic assessment system increased the kappa value to 0.45 with sensitivity and specificity observed at 0.61 and 0.97 respectively. 
  Conclusion:  Expert pattern recognition was found to be the method with the highest discriminative power in assessing an adnexal mass during premenopause. Additional assessment of serum CA 125 diminished the diagnostic accuracy. Standardized morphological sonographic assessment resulted in a moderate diagnostic accuracy. Supplementing the morphological sonographic assessment with CA 125 by using the RMI algorithm did not improve the diagnostic value.

10.1016/j.actbio.2013.06.027  |  Genetics  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Aseptic loosening of total joint replacements is driven by the reaction of macrophages to foreign body particles released from the implant. It was hypothesized that the macrophages' response to these particles is dependent, in addition to particle characteristics and contaminating biomolecules, on the state of macrophage polarization as determined by the local cytokine microenvironment. To test this hypothesis we differentiated M1 and M2 macrophages from human peripheral blood monocytes and compared their responses to titanium particles using genome-wide microarray analysis and a multiplex cytokine assay. In comparison to non-activated M0 macrophages, the overall chemotactic and inflammatory responses to titanium particles were greatly enhanced in M1 macrophages and effectively suppressed in M2 macrophages. In addition, the genome-wide approach revealed several novel, potentially osteolytic, particle-induced mediators, and signaling pathway analysis suggested the involvement of toll-like and nod-like receptor signaling in particle recognition. It is concluded that the magnitude of foreign body reaction caused by titanium particles is dependent on the state of macrophage polarization. Thus, by limiting the action of M1 polarizing factors, e.g. bacterial biofilm formation, in peri-implant tissues and promoting M2 macrophage polarization by biomaterial solutions or pharmacologically, it might be possible to restrict wear-particle-induced inflammation and osteolysis.

10.1111/ppl.12088  |  Genetics, Other  |  Drug Discovery, Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] is a non-essential metal for normal plants and is toxic to plants at high concentrations. However, signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms of its action on cell function and gene expression remain elusive. In this study, we found that Cr(VI) induced endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and Ca(2+) accumulation and activated NADPH oxidase and calcium-dependent protein kinase. We investigated global transcriptional changes in rice roots by microarray analysis. Gene expression profiling indicated activation of abscisic acid-, ethylene- and jasmonic acid-mediated signaling and inactivation of gibberellic acid-related pathways in Cr(VI) stress-treated rice roots. Genes encoding signaling components such as the protein kinases domain of unknown function 26, receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, LRK10-like kinase type 2 and protein phosphatase 2C, as well as transcription factors WRKY and apetala2/ethylene response factor were predominant during Cr(VI) stress. Genes involved in vesicle trafficking were subjected to functional characterization. Pretreating rice roots with a vesicle trafficking inhibitor, brefeldin A, effectively reduced Cr(VI)-induced ROS production. Suppression of the vesicle trafficking gene, Exo70, by virus-induced gene silencing strategies revealed that vesicle trafficking is required for mediation of Cr(VI)-induced ROS production. Taken together, these findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms in signaling pathways and transcriptional regulation in response to Cr stress in plants.

The majority of ASD cases stems from complex, 'multiple-hit', oligogenic/polygenic underpinnings involving several loci and possibly gene-environment interactions. These multiple layers of complexity spur interest into the identification of biomarkers able to define biologically homogeneous subgroups, predict autism risk prior to the onset of behavioural abnormalities, aid early diagnoses, predict the developmental trajectory of ASD children, predict response to treatment and identify children at risk for severe adverse reactions to psychoactive drugs. 
  Objectives:  The present paper reviews (a) similarities and differences between the concepts of 'biomarker' and 'endophenotype', (b) established biomarkers and endophenotypes in autism research (biochemical, morphological, hormonal, immunological, neurophysiological and neuroanatomical, neuropsychological, behavioural), (c) -omics approaches towards the discovery of novel biomarker panels for ASD, (d) bioresource infrastructures and (e) data management for biomarker research in autism. 
  Results:  Known biomarkers, such as abnormal blood levels of serotonin, oxytocin, melatonin, immune cytokines and lymphocyte subtypes, multiple neuropsychological, electrophysiological and brain imaging parameters, will eventually merge with novel biomarkers identified using unbiased genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic methods, to generate multimarker panels. Bioresource infrastructures, data management and data analysis using artificial intelligence networks will be instrumental in supporting efforts to identify these biomarker panels. 
  Conclusions:  Biomarker research has great heuristic potential in targeting autism diagnosis and treatment.

10.1104/pp.113.222588  |  Genetics, Other  |  Treatment, Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Complete submergence represses photosynthesis and aerobic respiration, causing rapid mortality in most terrestrial plants. However, some plants have evolved traits allowing them to survive prolonged flooding, such as species of the genus Rorippa, close relatives of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We studied plant survival, changes in carbohydrate and metabolite concentrations, and transcriptome responses to submergence of two species, Rorippa sylvestris and Rorippa amphibia. We exploited the close relationship between Rorippa species and the model species Arabidopsis by using Arabidopsis GeneChip microarrays for whole-genome transcript profiling of roots of young plants exposed to a 24-h submergence treatment or air. A probe mask was used based on hybridization of genomic DNA of both species to the arrays, so that weak probe signals due to Rorippa species/Arabidopsis mismatches were removed. Furthermore, we compared Rorippa species microarray results with those obtained for roots of submerged Arabidopsis plants. Both Rorippa species could tolerate deep submergence, with R. sylvestris surviving much longer than R. amphibia. Submergence resulted in the induction of genes involved in glycolysis and fermentation and the repression of many energy-consuming pathways, similar to the low-oxygen and submergence response of Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa). The qualitative responses of both Rorippa species to submergence appeared roughly similar but differed quantitatively. Notably, glycolysis and fermentation genes and a gene encoding sucrose synthase were more strongly induced in the less tolerant R. amphibia than in R. sylvestris. A comparison with Arabidopsis microarray studies on submerged roots revealed some interesting differences and potential tolerance-related genes in Rorippa species.

10.1007/s00268-012-1881-9  |  Treatment  |  Prognosis, Treatment  |  Stat  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  The St. Gallen consensus provides treatment recommendations for breast cancer based on prognostic factors. Although many patients' prognostic patterns are not easily matched with the prognostic patterns listed in the St. Gallen consensus, there has been no systematic investigation reporting the gap between treatment recommendations and actual postoperative treatment choices in clinical practice. 
  Methods:  Four hundred seventy-one patients with hormone receptor-positive [HR(+)] and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2-negative [HER2(-)] breast cancer were analyzed. These patients were classified into either the "crisp treatment group" or "fuzzy treatment group" based on the definitiveness of postoperative treatment selection based on St. Gallen treatment recommendations. The patients in the fuzzy treatment group were further classified into strata in which patients within each stratum shared the same prognostic factor patterns with similar recurrence rates. 
  Results:  A total of 87.3% of HR(+)HER2(-) patients were designated to the fuzzy treatment group. Four prognostic strata were constructed according to the survival tree model, and revealed that patients with poor prognostic profiles tended to receive endocrine therapy with chemotherapy. This suggests that postoperative chemotherapy is useful, although there was no statistical significance. 
  Conclusions:  We constructed prognostic profiles of patients in the fuzzy treatment group and examined the recurrence rates associated with two treatment regimens within each prognostic profile. These findings are exploratory, but they may be useful for planning prospective studies of the effectiveness of postoperative treatment regimens among patients with a heterogeneous combination of prognostic factors.

Intracellular Ca(2+) levels increased rapidly and dose-dependently upon glucose stimulation, accompanied with about threefold rapid increases in cellular stiffness. Subsequently, cellular stiffness diminished rapidly and settled at a value about twofold of the baseline. Capsaicin caused a similar transient increase in intracellular Ca(2+) changes. However, cellular stiffness increased gradually to about twofold until leveling off. The current study characterizes for the first time the biophysical properties underlying glucose-induced biphasic responses of insulin secretion, distinctive from the slow and single-phased stiffness response to capsaicin despite similar changes in intracellular Ca(2+) levels. The integrated AFM nanorobotics and optical investigation enables the fine dissection of mechano-property from ion channel activities in response to specific and non-specific agonist stimulation, providing novel biomechanical markers for the insulin secretion process.

This protection is known to be mediated in part by antigen-specific memory CD8(+) T cells, presumably those residing in the liver. We characterized and compared the transcriptional profile of parasite-specific memory CD8(+) T cells residing in the liver and spleen after immunization of mice with irradiated sporozoites. Microarray-based expression analysis of these memory CD8(+) T cells indicated that liver-resident memory cells display a distinct gene expression profile. We found major differences in the expression of immune function genes as well as genes involved in the cell cycle, cell trafficking, transcription and intracellular signaling. Importantly, the malaria parasite-induced liver-resident CD8(+) T cells display a transcriptional profile different to that described for CD8(+) T cells following other microbial challenges.

10.1007/s10637-013-9974-3  |  Treatment  |  Prognosis, Treatment, Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Low-dose metronomic chemotherapy is an emerging form of chemotherapy with distinct mechanisms of action from conventional chemotherapy (e.g., antiangiogenesis). Although developed to overcome resistance to conventional chemotherapy, metronomic chemotherapy is subject to resistance on its own. However, there is a paucity of information on mechanisms of resistance, on cross-resistance between metronomic regimens using different cytotoxic drugs, and on cross-resistance between metronomic versus conventional chemotherapy, or versus targeted antiangiogenic therapy. Herein we show that PC-3 human prostate cancer xenografts were sensitive to both metronomic cyclophosphamide and metronomic docetaxel, but resistant to metronomic topotecan. Conventional docetaxel was only moderately active in parental PC-3 and in metronomic cyclophosphamide resistant PC-3 tumors. However, in metronomic cyclophosphamide resistant PC-3 tumors combining conventional docetaxel or bolus cyclophosphamide therapy with continued metronomic cyclophosphamide was superior to each treatment alone. Furthermore, bevacizumab had single-agent activity against metronomic cyclophosphamide resistant PC-3 tumors. Microarray analyses identified altered regulation of protein translation as a potential mechanism of resistance to metronomic cyclophosphamide. Our results suggest that sensitivity to metronomic chemotherapy regimens using different cytotoxic drugs not only depends on shared mechanisms of action such as antiangiogenesis, but also on as yet unknown additional antitumor effects that appear to be drug-specific. As clinically observed with targeted antiangiogenic agents, the continued use of metronomic chemotherapy beyond progression may amplify the effects of added second-line therapies or vice versa. However, metronomic chemotherapy is no different from other systemic therapies in that predictive biomarkers will be essential to fully exploit this novel use of conventional chemotherapeutics.

10.1016/j.jtcvs.2013.09.035  |  Robotics  |  Diagnosis, Robotics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Review  |    Objective:  The study objective was to review our first 300 consecutive robotic-assisted mitral repairs performed from June 2005 to October 2012 and to compare the surgical outcomes of our previously reported initial 120 cases with the subsequent 180 procedures. 
  Methods:  Our initial 120 robotic-assisted mitral repairs were previously reported, and we now compare our early experience with the recent 180 consecutive procedures for a total of 300 robotic-assisted mitral repairs. There was no patient selection. Every patient in need of isolated mitral valve repair underwent this procedure. All patients received an annuloplasty band and 1 or more of the following: leaflet resection, secondary chordal transposition, or polytetrafluoroethylene neochordal replacement and edge-to-edge repair. 
  Results:  All 300 patients had preoperative echocardiographic findings of severe mitral regurgitation. There were no differences (P = not significant) between the initial and the recent cohorts for preoperative characteristics, including age (58.4 ± 10.5 years vs 59.9 years), female gender (35.8% vs 36.1%), ejection fraction (61.9% vs 60.6%), congestive heart failure (35.0% vs 36.7%), creatinine (0.94 mg/dL vs 0.98 mg/dL), and New York Heart Association class. The incidence of anterior and posterior leaflet prolapse was similar in both groups, whereas Barlow syndrome was higher in group 2 (5.8% vs 27.8%). There was 1 (0.33%) hospital mortality and no deaths in the last 180 cases. Overall, 8 patients (2.7%) required subsequent mitral valve replacement via a median sternotomy, 6 (5.0%) in the first group and 2 (1.1%) in the second group (P = .06). One patient in each group had mitral valve re-repair through a right mini-thoracotomy, and 1 patient in the first group required a mitral valve replacement via a mini-thoracotomy during the original procedure. Two of the 180 patients had documented cerebrovascular accident, but both fully recovered clinically. There was no cerebrovascular accident in the last 120 patients. Crossclamp times decreased from 116 minutes to 91 minutes in the second group despite starting a training program with a junior associate performing part of the procedure at the console in the last 100 cases. Post-pump echocardiograms showed no/trace mitral regurgitation in 86.1% of the last 180 patients and mild mitral regurgitation in 11.1%. Follow-up echocardiography for the last 180 patients from 1 month to more than 1 year showed no/trace mitral regurgitation in 64.6% of patients and mild mitral regurgitation in 23.1% of patients. Seven patients (10.8%) had moderate mitral regurgitation, and 1 patient (1.5%) had severe mitral regurgitation. 
  Conclusions:  The majority of complications and reoperations occurred early in our experience, especially using the first-generation da Vinci robot (Intuitive Surgical Inc, Sunnyvale, Calif). The newer da Vinci Si HD system with the addition of an adjustable left atrial roof retractor together with increased experience has made robotic-assisted mitral repair of all types of degenerative mitral valve pathology reproducible. The training of young surgeons in a stepwise fashion in high-volume centers will help to avoid the complications encountered during the introduction of this technology.

10.1007/s00425-013-1942-9  |  Genetics, Other  |  Diagnosis, Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   The phenotype of tomato high pigment-1 (hp1) mutant is characterized by overproduction of pigments including chlorophyll and carotenoids during fruit development and ripening. Although the increased plastid compartment size has been thought to largely attribute to the enhanced pigmentation, the molecular aspects of how the HP1/DDB1 gene manipulates plastid biogenesis and development are largely unknown. In the present study, we compared transcriptome profiles of immature fruit pericarp tissue between tomato cv. Ailsa Craig (WT) and its isogenic hp1 mutant. Over 20 million sequence reads, representing &gt; 1.6 Gb sequence data per sample, were generated and assembled into 21,972 and 22,167 gene models in WT and hp1, respectively, accounting for over 60 % official gene models in both samples. Subsequent analyses revealed that 8,322 and 7,989 alternative splicing events, 8833 or 8510 extended 5'-UTRs, 8,263 or 8,939 extended 3'-UTRs, and 1,136 and 1,133 novel transcripts, exist in WT and hp1, respectively. Significant differences in expression level of 880 genes were detected between the WT and hp1, many of which are involved in signaling transduction, transcription regulation and biotic and abiotic stresses response. Distinctly, RNA-seq datasets, quantitative RT-PCR analyses demonstrate that, in hp1 mutant pericarp tissue at early developmental stage, an apparent expression alteration was found in several regulators directly involved in plastid division and development. These results provide a useful reference for a more accurate and more detailed characterization of the molecular process in the development and pigmentation of tomato fruits.

10.1186/1476-4598-12-59  |  Genetics  |  Treatment, Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Prolactin (PRL) is essential for normal mammary gland development. PRL promotes mammary tumor formation in rodents and elevated serum prolactin is associated with increased risk of estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer in women. On the other hand, PRL may also exert pro-differentiation effects and act to suppress invasive features of established breast cancer. Previously published limited global transcript profiling analyses of prolactin-regulated gene expression in human breast cancer cells have exclusively been performed in vitro. The present study aimed to shed new light on how PRL modulates estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer through global transcript profiling of a human breast cancer xenograft model in vivo. 
  Methods:  The prolactin-responsive human T47D breast cancer cell line was xenotransplanted into nude mice and global transcript profiling was carried out following treatment with or without human PRL for 48 h. A subset of PRL-modulated transcripts was further validated using qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. 
  Results:  The in vivo analyses identified 130 PRL-modulated transcripts, 75 upregulated and 55 downregulated, based on fold change &gt;1.6 and P-value &lt;0.05. From this initial panel of transcripts, a subset of 18 transcripts with established breast cancer-relevance were selected and validated by qRT-PCR. Some but not all of the transcripts were also PRL-modulated in vitro. The selected PRL-modulated transcripts were tested for dependence on Stat5, Jak1 or Jak2 activation, and for co-regulation by 17β-estradiol (E2). The protein encoded by one of the PRL-regulated transcripts, PTHrP, was examined in a panel of 92 human breast cancers and found by in situ quantitative immunofluorescence analysis to be highly positively correlated with nuclear localized and tyrosine phosphorylated Stat5. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that PRL-upregulated genes were enriched in pathways involved in differentiation. Finally, a gene signature based on PRL-upregulated genes was associated with prolonged relapse-free and metastasis-free survival in breast cancer patients. 
  Conclusions:  This global analysis identified and validated a panel of PRL-modulated transcripts in an ER-positive human breast cancer xenotransplant model, which may have value as markers of relapse-free and metastasis-free survival. Gene products identified in the present study may facilitate ongoing deciphering of the pleiotropic effects of PRL on human breast cancer.

  Study design:  Retrospective pathologic evaluation of a prospective single-arm cohort study at a tertiary referral center. 
  Methods:  There were 48 patients with resectable OPSCC who consented for transoral robotic surgery (TORS) and banked tissue specimen for assessment. TORS was with or without adjuvant radiation or chemoradiation. Main outcome measures were p16(INK4a) status, human papillomavirus status, local-regional disease control, and overall, disease-specific, and disease-free survival. 
  Results:  p16(INK4a) and HPV positivity were identified in 73% and 74% of patients respectively. With a median follow-up of 38.8 months (2.5-63.3 months), only one local-regional relapse has occurred in both the p16(INK4a)-positive and p16(INK4a) -negative cohorts. No disease-specific, disease-free, and overall survival differences were observed between p16(INK4a) -positive and p16(INK4a)-negative patients (P = .446, P = .277, P = .643, respectively). 
  Conclusions:  p16(INK4a) was not prognostic in resectable OPSCC when treated with an initial TORS approach.

  Methods:  This was a retrospective review of 10 patients followed over a 5-year period at a single tertiary academic medical center. Patient, tumor, clinicopathologic, functional, and oncologic outcomes were collected and analyzed. 
  Results:  All cancers treated were either T1 (40%) or T2 (60%). Negative margins were achieved in all patients. Four patients received adjuvant radiation therapy (40%). No patients experienced surgical complications and all had excellent functional outcomes. Mean follow-up was 24 months (range, 2-60 months) with locoregional and distant control achieved in 8 patients (80%) and 9 patients (90%), respectively. 
  Conclusions:  Minor salivary malignancies of the oropharynx are a surgical disease. Short-term follow-up data demonstrate feasibility, low morbidity, good functional, and oncologic results for TORS management of these malignancies.

Our model assumes that the global functional characteristics of these differences are shared across patients, but it allows for the epileptic regions to vary between individuals. We evaluate the detection performance against intracranial EEG observations and compare our approach with two baseline methods that use standard statistics. The baseline techniques are sensitive to the choice of thresholds, whereas our algorithm automatically estimates the appropriate model parameters and compares favorably with the best baseline results. This suggests the promise of our approach for pre-surgical planning in epilepsy.

Enhancing this reactivation could potentially be a therapeutic target to augment kidney regeneration. The inductive events that drive kidney organogenesis in zebrafish are similar to the initial steps in mammalian kidney organogenesis. Therefore, quantifying embryonic signals that drive zebrafish kidney development is an attractive strategy for the discovery of potential novel therapeutic modalities that accelerate kidney regeneration. The Lim1 homeobox protein, Lhx1, is a marker of kidney development that is also expressed in the regenerating kidneys after injury. Using a fluorescent Lhx1a-EGFP transgene whose phenotype faithfully recapitulates that of the endogenous protein, we developed a high-content assay for Lhx1a-EGFP expression in transgenic zebrafish embryos employing an artificial intelligence-based image analysis method termed cognition network technology (CNT). Implementation of the CNT assay on high-content readers enabled automated real-time in vivo time-course, dose-response, and variability studies in the developing embryo. The Lhx1a assay was complemented with a kidney-specific secondary CNT assay that enables direct measurements of the embryonic renal tubule cell population. The integration of fluorescent transgenic zebrafish embryos with automated imaging and artificial intelligence-based image analysis provides an in vivo analysis system for structure-activity relationship studies and de novo discovery of novel agents that augment innate regenerative processes.

Whether similar effects are found in other great apes has not yet been investigated. We carried out two experiments in which individual chimpanzees, <i>Pan troglodytes</i>, took items of food from an array in the presence of either an image of a large conspecific face or a scrambled control image. In experiment 1 we compared three versions of the face image varying in size and the amount of the face displayed. In experiment 2 we compared a fourth variant of the image with more prominent coloured eyes displayed closer to the focal chimpanzee. The chimpanzees did not look at the face images significantly more than at the control images in either experiment. Although there were trends for some individuals in each experiment to be slower to take high-value food items in the face conditions, these were not consistent or robust. We suggest that the extreme human sensitivity to cues of potential conspecific observation may not be shared with chimpanzees.

One of the most relevant research topics that can benefit from these techniques is phylogenetic inference. Throughout the years, different researchers have proposed their own view about the reconstruction of ancestral evolutionary relationships among species. As a result, biologists often report different phylogenetic trees from a same dataset when considering distinct optimality principles. In this work, we detail a multiobjective swarm intelligence approach based on the novel Artificial Bee Colony algorithm for inferring phylogenies. The aim of this paper is to propose a complementary view of phylogenetics according to the maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood criteria, in order to generate a set of phylogenetic trees that represent a compromise between these principles. Experimental results on a variety of nucleotide data sets and statistical studies highlight the relevance of the proposal with regard to other multiobjective algorithms and state-of-the-art biological methods.

The proposed method, called spatiotemporal LME or ST-LME, builds on the flexible LME framework and exploits the spatial structure in image data. We instantiated ST-LME for the analysis of cortical surface measurements (e.g. thickness) computed by FreeSurfer, a widely-used brain Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) analysis software package. We validate the proposed ST-LME method and provide a quantitative and objective empirical comparison with two popular alternative methods, using two brain MRI datasets obtained from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS). Our experiments revealed that ST-LME offers a dramatic gain in statistical power and repeatability of findings, while providing good control of the false positive rate.

10.1118/1.4771931  |  Diagnosis, Smart Healthcare  |  Diagnosis, Treatment  |  DiscriminantAnalysis, MeanShift  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Purpose:  To develop a real-time automatic method for tracking implanted radiographic markers in low-contrast cine-MV patient images used in image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT). 
  Methods:  Intrafraction motion tracking using radiotherapy beam-line MV images have gained some attention recently in IGRT because no additional imaging dose is introduced. However, MV images have much lower contrast than kV images, therefore a robust and automatic algorithm for marker detection in MV images is a prerequisite. Previous marker detection methods are all based on template matching or its derivatives. Template matching needs to match object shape that changes significantly for different implantation and projection angle. While these methods require a large number of templates to cover various situations, they are often forced to use a smaller number of templates to reduce the computation load because their methods all require exhaustive search in the region of interest. The authors solve this problem by synergetic use of modern but well-tested computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques; specifically the authors detect implanted markers utilizing discriminant analysis for initialization and use mean-shift feature space analysis for sequential tracking. This novel approach avoids exhaustive search by exploiting the temporal correlation between consecutive frames and makes it possible to perform more sophisticated detection at the beginning to improve the accuracy, followed by ultrafast sequential tracking after the initialization. The method was evaluated and validated using 1149 cine-MV images from two prostate IGRT patients and compared with manual marker detection results from six researchers. The average of the manual detection results is considered as the ground truth for comparisons. 
  Results:  The average root-mean-square errors of our real-time automatic tracking method from the ground truth are 1.9 and 2.1 pixels for the two patients (0.26 mm/pixel). The standard deviations of the results from the 6 researchers are 2.3 and 2.6 pixels. The proposed framework takes about 128 ms to detect four markers in the first MV images and about 23 ms to track these markers in each of the subsequent images. 
  Conclusions:  The unified framework for tracking of multiple markers presented here can achieve marker detection accuracy similar to manual detection even in low-contrast cine-MV images. It can cope with shape deformations of fiducial markers at different gantry angles. The fast processing speed reduces the image processing portion of the system latency, therefore can improve the performance of real-time motion compensation.

10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2013.03.017  |  None  |  Prognosis  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Rosen classified sciences into two categories: formalizable and unformalizable. Whereas formalizable sciences expressed in terms of mathematical theories were highly valued by Rutherford, Hutchins pointed out that unformalizable parts of soft sciences are of genuine interest and importance. Attempts to build mathematical theories for biology in the past century was met with modest and sporadic successes, and only in simple systems. In this article, a qualitative model of humans' high creativity is presented as a starting point to consider whether the gap between soft and hard sciences is bridgeable. Simonton's chance-configuration theory, which mimics the process of evolution, was modified and improved. By treating problem solving as a process of pattern recognition, the known dichotomy of visual thinking vs. verbal thinking can be recast in terms of analog pattern recognition (non-algorithmic process) and digital pattern recognition (algorithmic process), respectively. Additional concepts commonly encountered in computer science, operations research and artificial intelligence were also invoked: heuristic searching, parallel and sequential processing. The refurbished chance-configuration model is now capable of explaining several long-standing puzzles in human cognition: a) why novel discoveries often came without prior warning, b) why some creators had no ideas about the source of inspiration even after the fact, c) why some creators were consistently luckier than others, and, last but not least, d) why it was so difficult to explain what intuition, inspiration, insight, hunch, serendipity, etc. are all about. The predictive power of the present model was tested by means of resolving Zeno's paradox of Achilles and the Tortoise after one deliberately invoked visual thinking. Additional evidence of its predictive power must await future large-scale field studies. The analysis was further generalized to constructions of scientific theories in general. This approach is in line with Campbell's evolutionary epistemology. Instead of treating science as immutable Natural Laws, which already existed and which were just waiting to be discovered, scientific theories are regarded as humans' mental constructs, which must be invented to reconcile with observed natural phenomena. In this way, the pursuit of science is shifted from diligent and systematic (or random) searching for existing Natural Laws to firing up humans' imagination to comprehend Nature's behavioral pattern. The insights gained in understanding human creativity indicated that new mathematics that is capable of handling effectively parallel processing and human subjectivity is sorely needed. The past classification of formalizability vs. non-formalizability was made in reference to contemporary mathematics. Rosen's conclusion did not preclude future inventions of new biology-friendly mathematics.

10.1186/1752-0509-7-43  |  Other  |  None, Other  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Systems Biology develops computational models in order to understand biological phenomena. The increasing number and complexity of such "bio-models" necessitate computer support for the overall modelling task. Computer-aided modelling has to be based on a formal semantic description of bio-models. But, even if computational bio-models themselves are represented precisely in terms of mathematical expressions their full meaning is not yet formally specified and only described in natural language. 
  Results:  We present a conceptual framework - the meaning facets - which can be used to rigorously specify the semantics of bio-models. A bio-model has a dual interpretation: On the one hand it is a mathematical expression which can be used in computational simulations (intrinsic meaning). On the other hand the model is related to the biological reality (extrinsic meaning). We show that in both cases this interpretation should be performed from three perspectives: the meaning of the model's components (structure), the meaning of the model's intended use (function), and the meaning of the model's dynamics (behaviour). In order to demonstrate the strengths of the meaning facets framework we apply it to two semantically related models of the cell cycle. Thereby, we make use of existing approaches for computer representation of bio-models as much as possible and sketch the missing pieces. 
  Conclusions:  The meaning facets framework provides a systematic in-depth approach to the semantics of bio-models. It can serve two important purposes: First, it specifies and structures the information which biologists have to take into account if they build, use and exchange models. Secondly, because it can be formalised, the framework is a solid foundation for any sort of computer support in bio-modelling. The proposed conceptual framework establishes a new methodology for modelling in Systems Biology and constitutes a basis for computer-aided collaborative research.

These models exploit the optical transparency of zebrafish larvae and the availability of a large genetic tool box. Here we present detailed protocols for the robotic injection of zebrafish embryos at very high accuracy with a speed of up to 2000 embryos per hour. These protocols are benchmarked for several applications: (1) the injection of DNA for obtaining transgenic animals, (2) the injection of antisense morpholinos that can be used for gene knock-down, (3) the injection of microbes for studying infectious disease, and (4) the injection of human cancer cells as a model for tumor progression. We show examples of how the injected embryos can be screened at high-throughput level using fluorescence analysis. Our methods open up new avenues for the use of zebrafish larvae for large compound screens in the search for new medicines.

10.1093/molbev/mst099  |  Genetics  |  Diagnosis, Genetics  |  Stat  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   The recent explosion in available genetic data has led to significant advances in understanding the demographic histories of and relationships among human populations. It is still a challenge, however, to infer reliable parameter values for complicated models involving many populations. Here, we present MixMapper, an efficient, interactive method for constructing phylogenetic trees including admixture events using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data. MixMapper implements a novel two-phase approach to admixture inference using moment statistics, first building an unadmixed scaffold tree and then adding admixed populations by solving systems of equations that express allele frequency divergences in terms of mixture parameters. Importantly, all features of the model, including topology, sources of gene flow, branch lengths, and mixture proportions, are optimized automatically from the data and include estimates of statistical uncertainty. MixMapper also uses a new method to express branch lengths in easily interpretable drift units. We apply MixMapper to recently published data for Human Genome Diversity Cell Line Panel individuals genotyped on a SNP array designed especially for use in population genetics studies, obtaining confident results for 30 populations, 20 of them admixed. Notably, we confirm a signal of ancient admixture in European populations-including previously undetected admixture in Sardinians and Basques-involving a proportion of 20-40% ancient northern Eurasian ancestry.

  Design:  Retrospective cross-sectional study. 
  Setting:  Tertiary care hospitals in Boston, including Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital. 
  Participants:  We identified 3568 individuals with AA seen in the Partners health care system in Boston between January 1, 2000, and January 1, 2011. We performed comprehensive searches of the Research Patient Data Repository using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code 704.01. We randomly selected 350 patients and manually reviewed their medical records to train and validate a novel artificial intelligence program. This program then used natural language processing to review free-text medical records and confirm a diagnosis of AA. To confirm the algorithm, we manually reviewed a subset of records and found 93.9% validity. 
  Main outcomes and measures:  The prevalence of comorbid conditions was assessed. 
  Results:  Common comorbid conditions included autoimmune diagnoses (thyroid disease in 14.6%, diabetes mellitus in 11.1%, inflammatory bowel disease in (2.0%) [corrected], systemic lupus erythematosus in 4.3%, rheumatoid arthritis in 3.9%, and psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in (6.3%) [corrected], atopy (allergic rhinitis, asthma, and/or eczema in 38.2% and contact dermatitis and other eczema in 35.9%), and mental health problems (depression or anxiety in 25.5%). We also found high prevalences of hyperlipidemia (24.5%), hypertension (21.9%), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (17.3%). This profile was different from that seen in a comparison psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis group. 
  Conclusions and relevance:  We found a high prevalence of comorbid conditions among individuals with AA presenting to academic medical centers in Boston. Physicians caring for patients with AA should consider screening for comorbid conditions.

10.1093/hmg/ddt298  |  Genetics  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding the purine metabolic enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). A series of motor, cognitive and neurobehavioral anomalies characterize this disease phenotype, which is still poorly understood. The clinical manifestations of this syndrome are believed to be the consequences of deficiencies in neurodevelopmental pathways that lead to disordered brain function. We have used microRNA array and gene ontology analysis to evaluate the gene expression of differentiating HPRT-deficient human neuron-like cell lines. We set out to identify dysregulated genes implicated in purine-based cellular functions. Our approach was based on the premise that HPRT deficiency affects preeminently the expression and the function of purine-based molecular complexes, such as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and small GTPases. We found that several microRNAs from the miR-17 family cluster and genes encoding GEF are dysregulated in HPRT deficiency. Most notably, our data show that the expression of the exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC) is blunted in HPRT-deficient human neuron-like cell lines and fibroblast cells from LNS patients, and is altered in the cortex, striatum and midbrain of HPRT knockout mouse. We also show a marked impairment in the activation of small GTPase RAP1 in the HPRT-deficient cells, as well as differences in cytoskeleton dynamics that lead to increased motility for HPRT-deficient neuron-like cell lines relative to control. We propose that the alterations in EPAC/RAP1 signaling and cell migration in HPRT deficiency are crucial for neuro-developmental events that may contribute to the neurological dysfunctions in LNS.

10.1530/ERC-13-0357  |  Genetics  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a class of small, non-coding RNAs that control gene expression by targeting mRNA and triggering either translational repression or RNA degradation. The objective of our study was to evaluate the involvement of miRNAs in human medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and to identify the markers of metastatic cells and aggressive tumour behaviour. Using matched primary and metastatic tumour samples, we identified a subset of miRNAs aberrantly regulated in metastatic MTC. Deregulated miRNAs were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR and validated by in situ hybridisation on a large independent set of primary and metastatic MTC samples. Our results uncovered ten miRNAs that were significantly expressed and deregulated in metastatic tumours: miR-10a, miR-200b/-200c, miR-7 and miR-29c were down-regulated and miR-130a, miR-138, miR-193a-3p, miR-373 and miR-498 were up-regulated. Bioinformatic approaches revealed potential miRNA targets and signals involved in metastatic MTC pathways. Migration, proliferation and invasion assays were performed in cell lines treated with miR-200 antagomirs to ascertain a direct role for this miRNA in MTC tumourigenesis. We show that the members of miR-200 family regulate the expression of E-cadherin by directly targeting ZEB1 and ZEB2 mRNA and through the enhanced expression of tumour growth factor β (TGFβ)-2 and TGFβ-1. Overall, the treated cells shifted to a mesenchymal phenotype, thereby acquiring an aggressive phenotype with increased motility and invasion. Our data identify a robust miRNA signature associated with metastatic MTC and distinct biological processes, e.g., TGFβ signalling pathway, providing new potential insights into the mechanisms of MTC metastasis.

10.1534/genetics.112.147330  |  Genetics, Other  |  Diagnosis, Genetics  |  Stat  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Long-range migrations and the resulting admixtures between populations have been important forces shaping human genetic diversity. Most existing methods for detecting and reconstructing historical admixture events are based on allele frequency divergences or patterns of ancestry segments in chromosomes of admixed individuals. An emerging new approach harnesses the exponential decay of admixture-induced linkage disequilibrium (LD) as a function of genetic distance. Here, we comprehensively develop LD-based inference into a versatile tool for investigating admixture. We present a new weighted LD statistic that can be used to infer mixture proportions as well as dates with fewer constraints on reference populations than previous methods. We define an LD-based three-population test for admixture and identify scenarios in which it can detect admixture events that previous formal tests cannot. We further show that we can uncover phylogenetic relationships among populations by comparing weighted LD curves obtained using a suite of references. Finally, we describe several improvements to the computation and fitting of weighted LD curves that greatly increase the robustness and speed of the calculations. We implement all of these advances in a software package, ALDER, which we validate in simulations and apply to test for admixture among all populations from the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP), highlighting insights into the admixture history of Central African Pygmies, Sardinians, and Japanese.

10.2196/jmir.2353  |  Smart Healthcare  |  Smart Healthcare  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Medical blogs have emerged as new media, extending to a wider range of medical audiences, including health professionals and patients to share health-related information. However, extraction of quality health-related information from medical blogs is challenging primarily because these blogs lack systematic methods to organize their posts. Medical blogs can be categorized according to their author into (1) physician-written blogs, (2) nurse-written blogs, and (3) patient-written blogs. This study focuses on how to organize physician-written blog posts that discuss disease-related issues and how to extract quality information from these posts. 
  Objective:  The goal of this study was to create and implement a prototype for a Web-based system, called ICDTag, based on a hybrid taxonomy-folksonomy approach that follows a combination of a taxonomy classification schemes and user-generated tags to organize physician-written blog posts and extract information from these posts. 
  Methods:  First, the design specifications for the Web-based system were identified. This system included two modules: (1) a blogging module that was implemented as one or more blogs, and (2) an aggregator module that aggregated posts from different blogs into an aggregator website. We then developed a prototype for this system in which the blogging module included two blogs, the cardiology blog and the gastroenterology blog. To analyze the usage patterns of the prototype, we conducted an experiment with data provided by cardiologists and gastroenterologists. Next, we conducted two evaluation types: (1) an evaluation of the ICDTag blog, in which the browsing functionalities of the blogging module were evaluated from the end-user's perspective using an online questionnaire, and (2) an evaluation of information quality, in which the quality of the content on the aggregator website was assessed from the perspective of medical experts using an emailed questionnaire. 
  Results:  Participants of this experiment included 23 cardiologists and 24 gastroenterologists. Positive evaluations on the main functions and the organization of information on the ICDTag blogs were given by 18 of the participants via an online questionnaire. These results supported our hypothesis that the use of a taxonomy-folksonomy structure has significant potential to improve the organization of information in physician-written blogs. The quality of the content on the aggregator website was assessed by 3 cardiology experts and 3 gastroenterology experts via an email questionnaire. The results of this questionnaire demonstrated that the experts considered the aggregated tags and categories semantically related to the posts' content. 
  Conclusions:  This study demonstrated that applying the hybrid taxonomy-folksonomy approach to physician-written blogs that discuss disease-related issues has valuable potential to make these blogs a more organized and systematic medium and supports the extraction of quality information from their posts. Thus, it is worthwhile to develop more mature systems that make use of the hybrid approach to organize posts in physician-written blogs.

10.1186/1471-2105-14-299  |  Genetics, Prognosis  |  Prognosis, Genetics  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Comprehensive protein-protein interaction (PPI) maps are a powerful resource for uncovering the molecular basis of genetic interactions and providing mechanistic insights. Over the past decade, high-throughput experimental techniques have been developed to generate PPI maps at proteome scale, first using yeast two-hybrid approaches and more recently via affinity purification combined with mass spectrometry (AP-MS). Unfortunately, data from both protocols are prone to both high false positive and false negative rates. To address these issues, many methods have been developed to post-process raw PPI data. However, with few exceptions, these methods only analyze binary experimental data (in which each potential interaction tested is deemed either observed or unobserved), neglecting quantitative information available from AP-MS such as spectral counts. 
  Results:  We propose a novel method for incorporating quantitative information from AP-MS data into existing PPI inference methods that analyze binary interaction data. Our approach introduces a probabilistic framework that models the statistical noise inherent in observations of co-purifications. Using a sampling-based approach, we model the uncertainty of interactions with low spectral counts by generating an ensemble of possible alternative experimental outcomes. We then apply the existing method of choice to each alternative outcome and aggregate results over the ensemble. We validate our approach on three recent AP-MS data sets and demonstrate performance comparable to or better than state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we provide an in-depth discussion comparing the theoretical bases of existing approaches and identify common aspects that may be key to their performance. 
  Conclusions:  Our sampling framework extends the existing body of work on PPI analysis using binary interaction data to apply to the richer quantitative data now commonly available through AP-MS assays. This framework is quite general, and many enhancements are likely possible. Fruitful future directions may include investigating more sophisticated schemes for converting spectral counts to probabilities and applying the framework to direct protein complex prediction methods.

We examined whether a letter-speech sound binding deficit is behaviorally detectable within the initial steps of learning a novel script. Both letter knowledge and word reading ability within the artificial script were assessed. An additional goal was to investigate the influence of instructional approach on the initial learning of letter-speech sound correspondences. We assigned children from both groups to one of three different training conditions: (a) explicit instruction, (b) implicit associative learning within a computer game environment, or (c) a combination of (a) and (b) in which explicit instruction is followed by implicit learning. Our results indicated that dyslexics were outperformed by the controls on a time-pressured binding task and a word reading task within the artificial orthography, providing empirical support for the view that a letter-speech sound binding deficit is a key factor in dyslexia. A combination of explicit instruction and implicit techniques proved to be a more powerful tool in the initial teaching of letter-sound correspondences than implicit training alone.

In this paper, a segmentation method based on Active Shape Model (ASM) is developed and evaluated to outline common carotid artery (CCA) for carotid atherosclerosis computer-aided evaluation and diagnosis. The proposed method is used to segment both media-adventitia-boundary (MAB) and lumen-intima-boundary (LIB) on transverse views slices from three-dimensional ultrasound (3D US) images. The data set consists of sixty-eight, 17 × 2 × 2, 3D US volume data acquired from the left and right carotid arteries of seventeen patients (eight treated with 80 mg atorvastatin and nine with placebo), who had carotid stenosis of 60% or more, at baseline and after three months of treatment. Manually outlined boundaries by expert are adopted as the ground truth for evaluation. For the MAB and LIB segmentations, respectively, the algorithm yielded Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 94.4% ± 3.2% and 92.8% ± 3.3%, mean absolute distances (MAD) of 0.26 ± 0.18 mm and 0.33 ± 0.21 mm, and maximum absolute distances (MAXD) of 0.75 ± 0.46 mm and 0.84 ± 0.39 mm. It took 4.3 ± 0.5 mins to segment single 3D US images, while it took 11.7 ± 1.2 mins for manual segmentation. The method would promote the translation of carotid 3D US to clinical care for the monitoring of the atherosclerotic disease progression and regression.

10.1007/s00464-012-2633-5  |  Robotics, Other  |  Robotics  |  Stat  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Increased intraocular pressure (IOP) during surgery can result in serious ophthalmic complications. We hypothesized that carbon dioxide (CO₂) insufflation of the neck during endoscopic thyroidectomy would constrict the jugular veins mechanically, causing elevated venous pressure and thus elevated IOP. We compared IOP changes at each step of open thyroidectomy (OT) versus robot-assisted endoscopic thyroidectomy (RET) METHODS: Perioperatively, IOP was measured at six time points in patients undergoing OT (n = 18) or RET with CO₂ insufflation (n = 19). Anesthesia, ventilatory strategy, intravenous infusions, and surgical positioning were standardized 
  Results:  In both groups, induction of anesthesia reduced IOP, but surgical positioning with the neck in extension had no effect on IOP. In the OT group, IOP remained unchanged during anesthesia. In the RET group, CO₂ insufflation significantly increased IOP to an average of 3.6 ± 3.0 mmHg higher than the previous measurement (P &lt; 0.001), and this IOP increase persisted immediately before gas deflation. These elevated IOP values during CO₂ insufflation in the RET group were significantly higher than those at corresponding time points in the OT group. However, these elevated IOP values were similar to the pre-anesthetic baseline IOP CONCLUSION: CO₂ insufflation of the neck at pressure of 6 mmHg increased the IOP significantly compared with open thyroidectomy. However, this increase in IOP could be balanced by an anesthetic-induced IOP-lowering effect, thereby having no clinical significance in patients with normal IOP undergoing robot-assisted endoscopic thyroidectomy.

However, its downstream effectors are poorly understood. To investigate the transcriptional targets of HGF, we analyzed the hearts of neonatal mice with cardiomyocyte-specific HGF overexpression with whole genome DNA microarrays. When comparing HGF expressing versus control hearts, we found a total of 249 transcripts with significant gene expression changes (210 upregulated and 39 downregulated). Gene Ontology (GO) annotation analysis revealed that the transcripts modulated by HGF were enriched for metabolic functions including: protein translation, vesicle-mediated transport, regulation of transcription, regulation of muscle development. Using an automated literature meta-analysis approach, we obtained a co-occurrence network oriented to the positive regulatory role of Myc and Notch1 in controlling some of the genes which are downstream to HGF. GO analysis of this network returned genes involved in the regulation of heart development. HGF positively controls MyocD, an activator of cardiac gene expression, and Hdac5, an inhibitor of cardiac growth. These results may unveil a new role of HGF in the modulation of signaling pathways implicated in the activation or repression of cardiomyogenesis.

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Postoperative complications for open radical nephrectomy (ORN), laparoscopic radical nephrectomy (LRN), and open partial nephrectomy (OPN) and its relationship with hospitalisation costs and mortality remain poorly described. The present population-based study suggests modest differences in postoperative complications estimated at 27%, 23%, and 24% among patients with kidney cancer undergoing ORN, LRN, and OPN, respectively. Moreover, postoperative complications were associated with higher mortality, length of stay and total costs of hospitalisation. 
  Objectives:  The association of complications after renal surgery for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with in-hospital mortality and costs remains to be defined. To describe the incidence of complications after open radical nephrectomy (ORN), laparoscopic RN (LRN), and open partial nephrectomy (OPN); and to evaluate its relationship with in-hospital mortality and total costs. 
  Patients and methods:  We identified 49 983 individuals who underwent ORN (35 712), LRN (5327), or OPN (8944) for RCC at 2037 hospitals from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2001-2008. The outcomes assessed were in-hospital mortality and total hospitalisation costs. Multivariable logistic regression and generalised estimating equations were used to test the associations between complications and in-hospital mortality and total costs. 
  Results:  With 26.0% of patients experiencing postoperative complications, there were modest differences in the proportion of patients with complications after ORN, LRN, and OPN at 27.0%, 22.6%, and 24.0%, respectively (P &lt; 0.001). After adjusting for patient and hospital variables, postoperative complications resulted in higher odds of in-hospital death for ORN (odds ratio [OR] 7.20; P &lt; 0.001), LRN (OR 12.04; P &lt; 0.001), and OPN (OR 7.82; P &lt; 0.001). Adjusted total costs also rose significantly with the presence of any postoperative complications compared with those without any complications for ORN ($21 242 vs $13 183; P &lt; 0.001), LRN ($19 548 vs $12 555; P &lt; 0.001), and OPN ($18 883 vs $12 098; P &lt; 0.001). 
  Conclusions:  With about a quarter of patients experiencing postoperative complications, adverse events for ORN, LRN, and OPN carry a significant risk of in-hospital death and higher total costs. Efforts to reduce postoperative complications may correlate with substantial reductions in hospital mortality and total costs.

  Objective:  To report oncologic and functional outcomes in a cohort of patients who have completed a minimum of 5 yr and a maximum of 8 yr of follow-up after RARC and extracorporeal urinary diversion. 
  Design, setting, and participants:  In this paper, we report on the experience from one of the first European urology centres to introduce RARC. Only patients between 2004 and 2006 were included to ensure follow-up of ≥ 5 yr. We report on an analysis of oncologic outcomes in 14 patients (11 males and 3 females) with muscle-invasive/high-grade non-muscle-invasive or bacillus Calmette-Guérin-refractory carcinoma in situ who opted to have RARC. 
  Intervention:  RARC with pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed using the three-arm standard da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, CA, USA). Urinary diversion, either ileal conduit (n=12) or orthotopic neobladder (n=2), was constructed extracorporeally. 
  Outcome measurements:  Parameters were recorded in a prospectively maintained database including assessment of renal function, overall survival, disease-specific survival, development of metastases, and functional outcomes. 
  Statistical analysis:  Results were analysed using descriptive statistical analysis. Survival data were analysed and presented using the Kaplan-Meier survival curve. 
  Results and limitations:  Five of the 14 patients have died. Three patients died of metastatic disease, and two died of unrelated causes. Two other patients are alive with metastases, and another has developed primary lung cancer. Six patients are alive and disease-free. These results show overall survival of 64%, disease-specific survival of 75%, and disease-free survival of 50%. None of the patients had deterioration of renal function necessitating renal replacement therapy. Three of four previously potent patients having nerve-sparing RARC recovered erectile function. The study is limited by the relatively small number of highly selected patients undergoing RARC, which was a novel technique 8 yr ago. The standard da Vinci Surgical System made extended lymphadenectomy difficult. 
  Conclusions:  Within limitations, in our experience RARC achieved excellent control of local disease, but the outcomes in patients with metastatic disease seem to be equivalent to the outcomes of open radical cystectomy.

We aimed to investigate whether there is a survival difference in stage 1 non-small-cell lung cancer patients who undergo lobectomy compared to a wedge resection. 
  Methods:  We retrospectively analyzed a prospective database of 1283 patients who had potentially curative resection for stage 1 non-small-cell lung cancer. Only patients with adenocarcinoma, squamous or adenosquamous carcinoma were included. We benchmarked our 5-year survival against the 6th International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer results. Three techniques were used to assess the effect of a lobectomy compared to a wedge resection with regard to long-term survival: Cox multivariate regression analysis, neuronal network analysis, and propensity matching. 
  Results:  Benchmarking failed to reveal any significant difference compared to the 6th International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer results. Crude analysis demonstrated superiority of lobectomy compared to wedge resection, p = 0.02. Cox regression analysis confirmed that age, body mass index, female sex, being a current smoker, tumor diameter, and preoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 s were all significant factors determining long-term survival. Wedge resection was not a significant factor. Neuronal network analysis concurred with the Cox regression analysis. Propensity matching with 1:1 matching demonstrated that wedge resections was not inferior to a lobectomy, p = 0.10. 
  Conclusions:  Cox regression analysis, neuronal network analysis, and propensity matching in stage 1 non-small-cell lung cancer demonstrate no difference in long-term survival after wedge resection compared to lobectomy.

10.1016/j.cognition.2013.01.005  |  None  |  None, Other  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Five experiments provide evidence for a class of 'dual character concepts.' Dual character concepts characterize their members in terms of both (a) a set of concrete features and (b) the abstract values that these features serve to realize. As such, these concepts provide two bases for evaluating category members and two different criteria for category membership. Experiment 1 provides support for the notion that dual character concepts have two bases for evaluation. Experiments 2-4 explore the claim that dual character concepts have two different criteria for category membership. The results show that when an object possesses the appropriate concrete features, but does not fulfill the appropriate abstract value, it is judged to be a category member in one sense but not in another. Finally, Experiment 5 uses the theory developed here to construct artificial dual character concepts and examines whether participants react to these artificial concepts in the same way as naturally occurring dual character concepts. The present studies serve to define the nature of dual character concepts and distinguish them from other types of concepts (e.g., natural kind concepts), which share some, but not all of the properties of dual character concepts. More broadly, these phenomena suggest a normative dimension in everyday conceptual representation.

Lymph node metastasis is a significant factor that greatly impacts disease prognosis in CRC cases. The underlying factors that cause lymph node metastasis in CRC cells are not fully understood. We investigated the mechanism that might induce CRC metastasis by focusing on smaller sized (&lt;2 cm) invasive tumors. We carried out gene expression array analysis for CRC cases; group 1 consisted of 6 cases with tumors &lt;2 cm with metastases, and group 2 consisted of 65 cases with tumors &gt;2 cm without metastases. Results were validated using gene expression array data from an additional 77 cases and another bulk case set of 172 cases. Gene ontology and pathway analysis using microarray data revealed that anti-apoptotic activity had a crucial role in CRC metastasis. High mobility group A1 (HMGA1) was identified as a biomarker for poor prognosis and metastasis formation. HMGA1 expression levels were higher in lymph node-positive cases than in lymph node-negative cases, even in subgroup analysis of submucosal invasive cases. The present study strongly supports the clinical significance of HMGA1 expression as a predictive indicator of lymph node metastasis in CRC cases, even in submucosal invasive cases which could be cured by local resection.

10.1371/journal.pone.0070622  |  Genetics  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Interleukin-1β and Tumor Necrosis Factor α play related, but distinct, roles in immunity and disease. Our study revealed major mechanistic distinctions in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling-dependent induction for the rapidly expressed genes (IL1B and TNF) coding for these two cytokines. Prior to induction, TNF exhibited pre-bound TATA Binding Protein (TBP) and paused RNA Polymerase II (Pol II), hallmarks of poised immediate-early (IE) genes. In contrast, unstimulated IL1B displayed very low levels of both TBP and paused Pol II, requiring the lineage-specific Spi-1/PU.1 (Spi1) transcription factor as an anchor for induction-dependent interaction with two TLR-activated transcription factors, C/EBPβ and NF-κB. Activation and DNA binding of these two pre-expressed factors resulted in de novo recruitment of TBP and Pol II to IL1B in concert with a permissive state for elongation mediated by the recruitment of elongation factor P-TEFb. This Spi1-dependent mechanism for IL1B transcription, which is unique for a rapidly-induced/poised IE gene, was more dependent upon P-TEFb than was the case for the TNF gene. Furthermore, the dependence on phosphoinositide 3-kinase for P-TEFb recruitment to IL1B paralleled a greater sensitivity to the metabolic state of the cell and a lower sensitivity to the phenomenon of endotoxin tolerance than was evident for TNF. Such differences in induction mechanisms argue against the prevailing paradigm that all IE genes possess paused Pol II and may further delineate the specific roles played by each of these rapidly expressed immune modulators.

10.1186/1471-2229-13-170  |  Genetics, Other  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  HIGH-LEVEL EXPRESSION OF SUGAR INDUCIBLE GENE2 (HSI2), also known as VAL1, is a B3 domain transcriptional repressor that acts redundantly with its closest relative, HSI2-LIKE1 (HSL1), to suppress the seed maturation program following germination. Mutant hsi2 hsl1 seedlings are arrested early in development and differentially express a number of abiotic stress-related genes. To test the potential requirement for HSI2 during abiotic stress, hsi2 single mutants and plants overexpressing HSI2 were subjected to simulated drought stress by withholding watering, and characterized through physiological, metabolic and gene expression studies. 
  Results:  The hsi2 mutants demonstrated reduced wilting and maintained higher relative water content than wild-type after withholding watering, while the overexpressing lines displayed the opposite phenotype. The hsi2 mutant displayed lower constitutive and ABA-induced stomatal conductance than wild-type and accumulated lower levels of ABA metabolites and several osmolytes and osmoprotectants following water withdrawal. Microarray comparisons between wild-type and the hsi2 mutant revealed that steady-state levels of numerous stress-induced genes were up-regulated in the mutant in the absence of stress but down-regulated at visible wilting. Plants with altered levels of HSI2 responded to exogenous application of ABA and a long-lived ABA analog, but the hsi2 mutant did not show altered expression of several ABA-responsive or ABA signalling genes 4 hr after application. 
  Conclusions:  These results implicate HSI2 as a negative regulator of drought stress response in Arabidopsis, acting, at least in part, by regulating transpirational water loss. Metabolic and global transcript profiling comparisons of the hsi2 mutant and wild-type plants do not support a model whereby the greater drought tolerance observed in the hsi2 mutant is conferred by the accumulation of known osmolytes and osmoprotectants. Instead, data are consistent with mutants experiencing a relatively milder dehydration stress following water withdrawal.

10.1186/1471-2105-14-S8-S8  |  Other  |  None, Other  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Recent microbiologic studies have shown that quorum sensing mechanisms, which serve as one of the fundamental requirements for bacterial survival, exist widely in bacterial intra- and inter-species cell-cell communication. Many simulation models, inspired by the social behavior of natural organisms, are presented to provide new approaches for solving realistic optimization problems. Most of these simulation models follow population-based modelling approaches, where all the individuals are updated according to the same rules. Therefore, it is difficult to maintain the diversity of the population. 
  Results:  In this paper, we present a computational model termed LCM-QS, which simulates the bacterial quorum-sensing (QS) mechanism using an individual-based modelling approach under the framework of Agent-Environment-Rule (AER) scheme, i.e. bacterial lifecycle model (LCM). LCM-QS model can be classified into three main sub-models: chemotaxis with QS sub-model, reproduction and elimination sub-model and migration sub-model. The proposed model is used to not only imitate the bacterial evolution process at the single-cell level, but also concentrate on the study of bacterial macroscopic behaviour. Comparative experiments under four different scenarios have been conducted in an artificial 3-D environment with nutrients and noxious distribution. Detailed study on bacterial chemotatic processes with quorum sensing and without quorum sensing are compared. By using quorum sensing mechanisms, artificial bacteria working together can find the nutrient concentration (or global optimum) quickly in the artificial environment. 
  Conclusions:  Biomimicry of quorum sensing mechanisms using the lifecycle model allows the artificial bacteria endowed with the communication abilities, which are essential to obtain more valuable information to guide their search cooperatively towards the preferred nutrient concentrations. It can also provide an inspiration for designing new swarm intelligence optimization algorithms, which can be used for solving the real-world problems.

10.1159/000354607  |  Prognosis, Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Review  |    Background:  Vitiligo is a common disorder of depigmentation that has been associated with other autoimmune diseases. No recent large-scale data exist on the rates of comorbidities associated with vitiligo from the United States population. 
  Objectives:  To identify the prevalence of comorbidities as well as associated laboratory abnormalities in vitiligo patients. 
  Methods:  All medical records dating from January 1, 2000 to June 21, 2011 within the Research Patient Data Repository were evaluated retrospectively using a novel artificial intelligence-based computer program. A total of 3,280 patients carrying the diagnosis of vitiligo were identified using ICD-9 code 709.01. We randomly selected 300 patients and validated the diagnosis by manually reviewing their medical records. These results were used to create a model that was then applied to the larger set yielding 2,441 true vitiligo patients. 1,657 (68%) were diagnosed by dermatologists and 784 (32%) by non-dermatologists. We identified the prevalence of other comorbid autoimmune conditions by searching problem lists of vitiligo patients and collected laboratory data from the first available data point in the system for each patient. 
  Results:  Women were more frequently represented (57.6%) than men (42.4%). The majority of vitiligo patients were White/Caucasian (56.9%), followed by Hispanic/Latino (19.4%). 565 (23%) had one of the following comorbidities: 287 thyroid-related, 186 psoriasis, 72 rheumatoid arthritis, 59 alopecia areata, 55 inflammatory bowel disease, 53 systemic lupus and 20 type I diabetes mellitus. 41% had elevated anti-nuclear antibody levels. Almost half of the patients tested had elevated thyroid peroxidase antibodies. Over 50% of the patients tested had low or insufficient levels of 25-OH vitamin D. 
  Conclusion:  We found a high prevalence of comorbidities among individuals with vitiligo presenting to teaching hospitals in Boston, Mass. Comorbid autoimmune conditions were seen in 23% of vitiligo patients, thyroid disorders and psoriasis being the most common. Screening for these conditions, especially thyroid disorders, should be considered in vitiligo patients.

10.1016/j.jcrs.2013.04.038  |  Other  |  None, Other  |  Stat  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Purpose:  To assess the visual and refractive outcomes of femtosecond laser-assisted implantation of Ferrara-type intrastromal corneal ring segments (ICRS) in post-penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) eyes. 
  Setting:  Instituto Oftalmológico Fernández-Vega, Oviedo, Spain. 
  Design:  Cohort study. 
  Methods:  Patients with previous PKP had ICRS implantation after femtosecond laser tunnel creation. The uncorrected (UDVA) and corrected (CDVA) distance visual acuities and residual refractive errors were recorded before and 6 months after ICRS implantation. The power vector method was used to analyze refractive errors preoperatively and postoperatively. 
  Results:  This study enrolled 32 eyes of 30 patients. The mean UDVA (Snellen decimal) changed from 0.16 ± 0.15 (SD) preoperatively to 0.43 ± 0.28 postoperatively (P&lt;.0001). Postoperatively, the UDVA was 20/40 or better in 40.6% of eyes. The mean CDVA was 0.67 ± 0.22 preoperatively and 0.80 ± 0.19 postoperatively (P&lt;.0001). Postoperatively, the CDVA was better than 20/40 in 96.9% of eyes and 20/25 or better in 56.2% of eyes. By 6 months postoperatively, no eye had lost more than 2 lines of CDVA, 4 eyes lost 1 line, 6 eyes had no change, 9 eyes gained 1 line, and 13 eyes gained 2 or more lines. The safety index at 6 months was 1.20. The spherical equivalent and astigmatism components were significantly reduced after ICRS implantation (P&lt;.04). 
  Conclusion:  Intrastromal corneal ring segment implantation using the femtosecond laser may be a good alternative for high astigmatism correction in post-PKP eyes.

Direct comparisons of diagnostic accuracy of various surveillance systems are scarce. 
  Objective:  To statistically compare sensitivity and specificity of multiple proprietary and open source syndrome surveillance systems to detect influenza-like illness (ILI). 
  Methods:  A retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted utilizing data from 1122 patients seen during November 1–7, 2009 in the emergency department of a single urban academic medical center. The study compared the Geographic Utilization of Artificial Intelligence in Real-time for Disease Identification and Alert Notification (GUARDIAN) system to the Complaint Coder (CoCo) of the Real-time Outbreak Detection System (RODS), the Symptom Coder (SyCo) of RODS, and to a standardized report generated via a proprietary electronic medical record (EMR) system. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of each classifier's ability to identify ILI cases were calculated and compared to a manual review by a board-certified emergency physician. Chi-square and McNemar's tests were used to evaluate the statistical difference between the various surveillance systems.ResultsThe performance of GUARDIAN in detecting ILI in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, as compared to a physician chart review, was 95.5%, 97.6%, and 97.1%, respectively. The EMR-generated reports were the next best system at identifying disease activity with a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 36.7%, 99.3%, and 83.2%, respectively. RODS (CoCo and SyCo) had similar sensitivity (35.3%) but slightly different specificity (CoCo = 98.9%; SyCo = 99.3%). The GUARDIAN surveillance system with its multiple data sources performed significantly better compared to CoCo (χ2 = 130.6, p &lt; 0.05), SyCo (χ2 = 125.2, p &lt; 0.05), and EMR-based reports (χ2 = 121.3, p &lt; 0.05). In addition, similar significant improvements in the accuracy (&gt;12%) and sensitivity (&gt;47%) were observed for GUARDIAN with only chief complaint data as compared to RODS (CoCo and SyCo) and EMR-based reports. 
  Conclusion:  In our study population, the GUARDIAN surveillance system, with its ability to utilize multiple data sources from patient encounters and real-time automaticity, demonstrated a more robust performance when compared to standard EMR-based reports and the RODS systems in detecting ILI. More large-scale studies are needed to validate the study findings, and to compare the performance of GUARDIAN in detecting other infectious diseases.

Previous molecular studies have revealed 7q loss and mutations of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), B-cell receptor (BCR) and Notch signalling genes. We performed whole-exome sequencing in a series of SMZL cases. Results confirmed that SMZL is an entity distinct from other low-grade B-cell lymphomas, and identified mutations in multiple genes involved in marginal zone development, and others involved in NF-κB, BCR, chromatin remodelling and the cytoskeleton.

10.1016/j.amjoto.2013.07.004  |  Diagnosis, Treatment  |  Diagnosis, Treatment  |  Stat  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Purpose and background:  Acoustic signals are transmitted through the external and middle ear mechanically to the cochlea where they are transduced into electrical impulse for further transmission via the auditory nerve. The auditory nerve encodes the acoustic sounds that are conveyed to the auditory brainstem. Multiple brainstem nuclei, the cochlea, the midbrain, the thalamus, and the cortex constitute the central auditory system. In clinical practice, auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to simple stimuli such as click or tones are widely used. Recently, complex stimuli or complex auditory brain responses (cABRs), such as monosyllabic speech stimuli and music, are being used as a tool to study the brainstem processing of speech sounds. We have used the classic 'click' as well as, for the first time, the artificial successive complex stimuli 'ba', which constitutes the Greek word 'baba' corresponding to the English 'daddy'. 
  Patients and methods:  Twenty young adults institutionally diagnosed as dyslexic (10 subjects) or light dyslexic (10 subjects) comprised the diseased group. Twenty sex-, age-, education-, hearing sensitivity-, and IQ-matched normal subjects comprised the control group. Measurements included the absolute latencies of waves I through V, the interpeak latencies elicited by the classical acoustic click, the negative peak latencies of A and C waves, as well as the interpeak latencies of A-C elicited by the verbal stimulus 'baba' created on a digital speech synthesizer. 
  Results:  The absolute peak latencies of waves I, III, and V in response to monoaural rarefaction clicks as well as the interpeak latencies I-III, III-V, and I-V in the dyslexic subjects, although increased in comparison with normal subjects, did not reach the level of a significant difference (p&lt;0.05). However, the absolute peak latencies of the negative wave C and the interpeak latencies of A-C elicited by verbal stimuli were found to be increased in the dyslexic group in comparison with the control group (p=0.0004 and p=0.045, respectively). In the subgroup consisting of 10 patients suffering from 'other learning disabilities' and who were characterized as with 'light' dyslexia according to dyslexia tests, no significant delays were found in peak latencies A and C and interpeak latencies A-C in comparison with the control group. 
  Conclusions:  Acoustic representation of a speech sound and, in particular, the disyllabic word 'baba' was found to be abnormal, as low as the auditory brainstem. Because ABRs mature in early life, this can help to identify subjects with acoustically based learning problems and apply early intervention, rehabilitation, and treatment. Further studies and more experience with more patients and pathological conditions such as plasticity of the auditory system, cochlear implants, hearing aids, presbycusis, or acoustic neuropathy are necessary until this type of testing is ready for clinical application.

10.1016/j.forsciint.2013.11.016  |  None  |  Diagnosis  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Chemical analysis of latent fingermarks, "touch chemistry," has the potential of providing intelligence or forensically relevant information. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI/TOF MS) was used as an analytical platform for obtaining mass spectra and chemical images of target drugs and explosives in fingermark residues following conventional fingerprint development methods and MALDI matrix processing. There were two main purposes of this research: (1) develop effective laboratory methods for detecting drugs and explosives in fingermark residues and (2) determine the feasibility of detecting drugs and explosives after casual contact with pills, powders, and residues. Further, synthetic latent print reference pads were evaluated as mimics of natural fingermark residue to determine if the pads could be used for method development and quality control. The results suggest that artificial amino acid and sebaceous oil residue pads are not suitable to adequately simulate natural fingermark chemistry for MALDI/TOF MS analysis. However, the pads were useful for designing experiments and setting instrumental parameters. Based on the natural fingermark residue experiments, handling whole or broken pills did not transfer sufficient quantities of drugs to allow for definitive detection. Transferring drugs or explosives in the form of powders and residues was successful for preparing analytes for detection after contact with fingers and deposition of fingermark residue. One downfall to handling powders was that the analyte particles were easily spread beyond the original fingermark during development. Analyte particles were confined in the original fingermark when using transfer residues. The MALDI/TOF MS was able to detect procaine, pseudoephedrine, TNT, and RDX from contact residue under laboratory conditions with the integration of conventional fingerprint development methods and MALDI matrix. MALDI/TOF MS is a nondestructive technique which provides chemical information in both the mass spectra and chemical images.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.12.021  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis, Drug Discovery  |  Stat  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Exploratory (i.e., voxelwise) spatial methods are commonly used in neuroimaging to identify areas that show an effect when a region-of-interest (ROI) analysis cannot be performed because no strong a priori anatomical hypothesis exists. However, noise at a single voxel is much higher than noise in a ROI making noise management critical to successful exploratory analysis. This work explores how preprocessing choices affect the bias and variability of voxelwise kinetic modeling analysis of brain positron emission tomography (PET) data. These choices include the use of volume- or cortical surface-based smoothing, level of smoothing, use of voxelwise partial volume correction (PVC), and PVC masking threshold. PVC was implemented using the Muller-Gartner method with the masking out of voxels with low gray matter (GM) partial volume fraction. Dynamic PET scans of an antagonist serotonin-4 receptor radioligand ([(11)C]SB207145) were collected on sixteen healthy subjects using a Siemens HRRT PET scanner. Kinetic modeling was used to compute maps of non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) after preprocessing. The results showed a complicated interaction between smoothing, PVC, and masking on BPND estimates. Volume-based smoothing resulted in large bias and intersubject variance because it smears signal across tissue types. In some cases, PVC with volume smoothing paradoxically caused the estimated BPND to be less than when no PVC was used at all. When applied in the absence of PVC, cortical surface-based smoothing resulted in dramatically less bias and the least variance of the methods tested for smoothing levels 5mm and higher. When used in combination with PVC, surface-based smoothing minimized the bias without significantly increasing the variance. Surface-based smoothing resulted in 2-4 times less intersubject variance than when volume smoothing was used. This translates into more than 4 times fewer subjects needed in a group analysis to achieve similarly powered statistical tests. Surface-based smoothing has less bias and variance because it respects cortical geometry by smoothing the PET data only along the cortical ribbon and so does not contaminate the GM signal with that of white matter and cerebrospinal fluid. The use of surface-based analysis in PET should result in substantial improvements in the reliability and detectability of effects in exploratory PET analysis, with or without PVC.

  Materials and methods:  Multi-dimensional Bayesian network classifiers (MBCs) are probabilistic graphical models especially designed to solve multi-dimensional classification problems, where each input instance in the data set has to be assigned simultaneously to multiple output class variables that are not necessarily binary. In this paper, we introduce a new method, named MB-MBC, for learning MBCs from data by determining the Markov blanket around each class variable using the HITON algorithm. Our method is applied to both reverse transcriptase and protease data sets obtained from the Stanford HIV-1 database. 
  Results:  Regarding the prediction of antiretroviral combination therapies, the experimental study shows promising results in terms of classification accuracy compared with state-of-the-art MBC learning algorithms. For reverse transcriptase inhibitors, we get 71% and 11% in mean and global accuracy, respectively; while for protease inhibitors, we get more than 84% and 31% in mean and global accuracy, respectively. In addition, the analysis of MBC graphical structures lets us gain insight into both known and novel interactions between reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors and their respective resistance mutations. 
  Conclusion:  MB-MBC algorithm is a valuable tool to analyze the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors prediction problem and to discover interactions within and between these two classes of inhibitors.

  Methods:  Eyes-closed resting-state EEGs of 36 MA abusers and 36 age-matched healthy subjects were recorded using a 32-channel system. The EEGs (1-60 Hz), after removing artifacts, were decomposed into the conventional EEG bands. Using visibility graph similarity (VGS) and coherence methods, the VGS and coherence matrices in each EEG band were constructed. Then the Small-World Network properties, clustering coefficient (C), mean path length (L) and C/L, of the VGS and coherence matrices, were computed in all EEG bands. Then using the Mann-Whitney test and an artificial neural network the differences of C, L and C/L between the two groups were evaluated. 
  Results:  The MA abusers showed higher C, lower L and higher C/L at the gamma band (p-value &lt; 0.005). An accuracy of 82.8% in discriminating the two groups was obtained by the classifier. 
  Conclusions:  The topology of the functional brain connectivity is disrupted in MA abusers, as depicted by deviation from Small-Worldness in the gamma band. 
  Significance:  This is the first but quasi-experimental study showing disrupted topology of the functional brain networks in MA abusers.

10.1016/j.midw.2013.07.001  |  Other  |  Treatment, Smart Healthcare  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Objectives:  during 2007 the Chilean Ministry of Public Health introduced the Model of Integrated and Humanized Health Services, in addition to the Clinical Guide for Humanized Care during Delivery. Three years after its implementation, a study was conducted (i) to describe selected clinical outcomes of women who received care within this model, (ii) to identify the degree of maternal-newborn well-being and (iii) to explore the perception of this humanised attention during labour and delivery by both the professional staff (obstetricians and midwives) and consumers. 
  Design and method:  a cross-sectional, descriptive study using both quantitative and qualitative methods was conducted with 508 women who delivered in two major hospitals within the National Health System in the metropolitan area of Santiago, Chile, from September 2010 until June 2011. The quantitative methods included a validated survey of maternal well-being and an adapted version of the American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM) standardised antepartum and intrapartum data set. The qualitative methods included six focus groups discussions (FGDs), with midwives, obstetricians and consumers. Additionally, two in depth interviews were carried out with the directors of the maternity units. 
  Findings:  the quantitative findings showed poor implementation of the guidelines: 92.7% of the women had medically induced labours (artificial rupture of the membranes and received oxytocin and epidural anaesthesia), and almost one-third of the women reported discontent with the care they received. The qualitative findings showed that the main complaint perceived by the midwives was that the health system was highly hierarchical and medicalised and that the obstetricians were not engaged in this modality of assistance. The women (consumers) highlighted that professionals (midwives and obstetricians) were highly technically skilled, and they felt confident in their assistance. However, women complained about receiving inadequate personal treatment from these professionals. The obstetricians showed no self-critique, stating that they always expressed concern for their patients and that they provided humanised professional assistance. 
  Conclusions and implications for practice:  by illuminating the main strengths and weakness with regard to the application of the model, these findings can help to inform strategies and actions to improve its implementation.

PMID:24001466  |  Other  |  Treatment  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Review  |    Introduction:  Denmark has been engaged in the Afghanistan war and as a result, Rigshospitalet has received a number of multi-traumatized Danish soldiers. Lesions sustained in armed conflict differ from their civilian counterparts and knowledge of the pathophysiology related to these types of lesions is essential when engaging in the intensive care of these patients. 
  Material and methods:  The study was conducted as a retrospective survey of Danish soldiers evacuated from Afghanistan to the Intensive Care Unit at Rigshospitalet in the 2002-2012 period. The following data were recorded: age, gender, hospitalization (days), mortality, organ involvement, respiratory therapy, dialysis, circulatory supportive care, antibiotic treatment and bacteriology. Furthermore, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation, Simplified Acute Physiology Score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were calculated. 
  Results:  A total of twenty patients were identified and included in the study. All patients had sustained serious blast injuries as a result of explosion. Primarily the central nervous system, respiratory, musculoskeletal and abdominal systems were affected by the explosions. Eighteen patients survived to discharge and two patients died. 
  Discussion:  Explosion was the most frequent cause of injury in all cases and caused damage to several organ systems. Infections after combat injuries are a major problem because of the different microbiological profile. 
  Conclusion:  The use of explosives has been and remains a substantial part of warfare, and this review has showed us that the knowledge of the mechanism of injury is indeed essential, and that intelligence on the microbiological flora of the geographical location of the conflict is essential.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.11.027  |  Diagnosis  |  None, Other  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) has become a popular imaging modality for probing the microstructural properties of white matter and comparing them between populations in vivo. However, the contrast in DW-MRI arises from the microscopic random motion of water molecules in brain tissues, which makes it particularly sensitive to macroscopic head motion. Although this has been known since the introduction of DW-MRI, most studies that use this modality for group comparisons do not report measures of head motion for each group and rely on registration-based correction methods that cannot eliminate the full effects of head motion on the DW-MRI contrast. In this work we use data from children with autism and typically developing children to investigate the effects of head motion on differences in anisotropy and diffusivity measures between groups. We show that group differences in head motion can induce group differences in DW-MRI measures, and that this is the case even when comparing groups that include control subjects only, where no anisotropy or diffusivity differences are expected. We also show that such effects can be more prominent in some white-matter pathways than others, and that they can be ameliorated by including motion as a nuisance regressor in the analyses. Our results demonstrate the importance of taking head motion into account in any population study where one group might exhibit more head motion than the other.

10.1371/journal.pone.0053199  |  Other  |  None, Other  |  Stat  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Graph theory deterministically models networks as sets of vertices, which are linked by connections. Such mathematical representation of networks, called graphs are increasingly used in neuroscience to model functional brain networks. It was shown that many forms of structural and functional brain networks have small-world characteristics, thus, constitute networks of dense local and highly effective distal information processing. Motivated by a previous small-world connectivity analysis of resting EEG-data we explored implications of a commonly used analysis approach. This common course of analysis is to compare small-world characteristics between two groups using classical inferential statistics. This however, becomes problematic when using measures of inter-subject correlations, as it is the case in commonly used brain imaging methods such as structural and diffusion tensor imaging with the exception of fibre tracking. Since for each voxel, or region there is only one data point, a measure of connectivity can only be computed for a group. To empirically determine an adequate small-world network threshold and to generate the necessary distribution of measures for classical inferential statistics, samples are generated by thresholding the networks on the group level over a range of thresholds. We believe that there are mainly two problems with this approach. First, the number of thresholded networks is arbitrary. Second, the obtained thresholded networks are not independent samples. Both issues become problematic when using commonly applied parametric statistical tests. Here, we demonstrate potential consequences of the number of thresholds and non-independency of samples in two examples (using artificial data and EEG data). Consequently alternative approaches are presented, which overcome these methodological issues.

However, little is known about patient outcomes after implementation of such a tool. 
  Objective:  To evaluate the implementation and effects of the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit as a bedside assessment for delirium in a general intensive care unit in a tertiary care hospital. 
  Methods:  Charts of patients admitted to the unit during a 3-month period before implementation of the assessment tool and 1 year after implementation were reviewed retrospectively. Patient outcomes were incidence of delirium diagnosis, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the intensive care unit, and time spent in restraints. 
  Results:  The 2 groups of patients did not differ in demographics, clinical characteristics, or predisposing factors. The groups also did not differ significantly in delirium diagnosis, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the intensive care unit, or time spent in restraints. Barriers to use of the tool included nurses' lack of confidence in performing the assessment, concerns about use of the tool in patients receiving mechanical ventilation, and lack of interdisciplinary response to findings obtained with the tool. 
  Conclusions:  No change in patient outcomes or diagnosis of delirium occurred 1 year after implementation of the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit. Lessons learned and barriers to adoption and use, however, were identified.

10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2015.05.011  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   The objective of this study was to assess how longitudinal change in the quantity and quality of white matter signal abnormalities (WMSAs) contributes to the progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). The Mahalanobis distance of WMSA from normal-appearing white matter using T1-, T2-, and proton density-weighted MRI was defined as a quality measure for WMSA. Cross-sectional analysis of WMSA volume in 104 cognitively healthy older adults, 116 individuals with MCI who converted to AD within 3 years (mild cognitive impairment converter [MCI-C]), 115 individuals with MCI that did not convert in that time (mild cognitive impairment nonconverter [MCI-NC]), and 124 individuals with AD from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative revealed that WMSA volume was substantially greater in AD relative to the other groups but did not differ between MCI-NC and MCI-C. Longitudinally, MCI-C exhibited faster WMSA quality progression but not volume compared with matched MCI-NC beginning 18 months before MCI-C conversion to AD. The strongest difference in rate of change was seen in the time period starting 6 months before MCI-C conversion to AD and ending 6 months after conversion (p &lt; 0.001). The relatively strong effect in this time period relative to AD conversion in the MCI-C was similar to the relative rate of change in hippocampal volume, a traditional imaging marker of AD pathology. These data demonstrate changes in white matter tissue properties that occur within WMSA in individuals with MCI that will subsequently obtain a clinical diagnosis of AD within 18 months. Individuals with AD have substantially greater WMSA volume than all MCI suggesting that there is a progressive accumulation of WMSA with progressive disease severity, and that quality change predates changes in this total volume. Given the timing of the changes in WMSA tissue quality relative to the clinical diagnosis of AD, these findings suggest that WMSAs are a critical component for this conversion and are a critical component of this clinical syndrome.

Here, brain activity was recorded using electroencephalogram while volunteers were listening or reading small texts and had to select pictures that translate meaning of these texts. Several techniques for EEG analysis were used to show this distributed character of neuronal enrollment associated with the comprehension of oral and written descriptive texts. Low Resolution Tomography identified the many different sets (s i ) of neurons activated in several distinct cortical areas by text understanding. Linear correlation was used to calculate the information H(e i ) provided by each electrode of the 10/20 system about the identified s i . H(e i ) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to study the temporal and spatial activation of these sources s i . This analysis evidenced 4 different patterns of H(e i ) covariation that are generated by neurons located at different cortical locations. These results clearly show that the distributed character of language processing is clearly evidenced by combining available EEG technologies.

A disturbance operation is added into the algorithm by constructing a disturbance factor to make a more careful and thorough search near the bird's nests location. In order to select a reasonable repeat-cycled disturbance number, a further study on the choice of disturbance times is made. Finally, six typical test functions are adopted to carry out simulation experiments, meanwhile, compare algorithms of this paper with two typical swarm intelligence algorithms particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. The results show that the improved cuckoo search algorithm has better convergence velocity and optimization accuracy.

Here we developed a cortical parcellation approach to accurately map functional organization at the individual level using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A population-based functional atlas and a map of inter-individual variability were employed to guide the iterative search for functional networks in individual subjects. Functional networks mapped by this approach were highly reproducible within subjects and effectively captured the variability across subjects, including individual differences in brain lateralization. The algorithm performed well across different subject populations and data types, including task fMRI data. The approach was then validated by invasive cortical stimulation mapping in surgical patients, suggesting potential for use in clinical applications.

Currently available treatments and surgical options are insufficient for patients with LDH. Fructus Ligustri Lucidi (FLL) is a herb that is used for treating age-associated diseases. The results of the present study suggested that FLL may be used for treatment of patients with LDH. In the present study, matrix metalloproteinase-1, -3, -8 and -9 (MMP-1, -3, -8 and -9) protein and mRNA expression downregulation was observed in patients with LDH according to western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. By contrast, upregulation of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) expression was observed in patients with LDH, according to an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mechanical allodynia was observed in rats with LDH not treated with FLL; however, not in FLL‑treated rats. IL-2, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α expression levels in the serum from untreated rats were significantly higher than that of the FLL‑treated rat models. Protein expression levels of MMPs in FLL-treated rats were lower than those in untreated rats. However, the mechanisms underlying the association between FLL and protein expression levels require further investigation.

10.1016/j.ajhg.2015.10.002  |  Genetics  |  Prognosis, Genetics  |  best linear unbiased prediction  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Genetic prediction based on either identity by state (IBS) sharing or pedigree information has been investigated extensively with best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) methods. Such methods were pioneered in plant and animal-breeding literature and have since been applied to predict human traits, with the aim of eventual clinical utility. However, methods to combine IBS sharing and pedigree information for genetic prediction in humans have not been explored. We introduce a two-variance-component model for genetic prediction: one component for IBS sharing and one for approximate pedigree structure, both estimated with genetic markers. In simulations using real genotypes from the Candidate-gene Association Resource (CARe) and Framingham Heart Study (FHS) family cohorts, we demonstrate that the two-variance-component model achieves gains in prediction r(2) over standard BLUP at current sample sizes, and we project, based on simulations, that these gains will continue to hold at larger sample sizes. Accordingly, in analyses of four quantitative phenotypes from CARe and two quantitative phenotypes from FHS, the two-variance-component model significantly improves prediction r(2) in each case, with up to a 20% relative improvement. We also find that standard mixed-model association tests can produce inflated test statistics in datasets with related individuals, whereas the two-variance-component model corrects for inflation.

Here, using both molecular and genome-wide next-generation sequencing methods, we report that neuronal activity stimulation triggers the formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in the promoters of a subset of early-response genes, including Fos, Npas4, and Egr1. Generation of targeted DNA DSBs within Fos and Npas4 promoters is sufficient to induce their expression even in the absence of an external stimulus. Activity-dependent DSB formation is likely mediated by the type II topoisomerase, Topoisomerase IIβ (Topo IIβ), and knockdown of Topo IIβ attenuates both DSB formation and early-response gene expression following neuronal stimulation. Our results suggest that DSB formation is a physiological event that rapidly resolves topological constraints to early-response gene expression in neurons.

Preliminary results of an ongoing phase I trial have reported promising activity and tolerability with the new BET bromodomain inhibitor OTX015. 
  Experimental design:  We assessed the preclinical activity of OTX015 as single agent and in combination in mature B-cell lymphoma models and performed in vitro and in vivo experiments to identify the mechanism of action and the genetic features associated with sensitivity to the compound. 
  Results:  OTX015 showed antiproliferative activity in a large panel of cell lines derived from mature B-cell lymphoid tumors with median IC50 of 240 nmol/L, without significant differences among the different histotypes. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that OTX015 targeted NFKB/TLR/JAK/STAT signaling pathways, MYC- and E2F1-regulated genes, cell-cycle regulation, and chromatin structure. OTX015 presented in vitro synergism with several anticancer agents, especially with mTOR and BTK inhibitors. Gene expression signatures associated with different degrees of sensitivity to OTX015 were identified. Although OTX015 was mostly cytostatic, the compound induced apoptosis in a genetically defined subgroup of cells, derived from activated B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, bearing wtTP53, mutations in MYD88, and CD79B or CARD11. 
  Conclusions:  Together with the data coming from the ongoing phase I study, the in vitro and in vivo data presented here provide the basis for further clinical investigation of OTX015 as single agent and in combination therapies.

10.1002/acn3.201  |  Genetics, Prognosis, Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Objective:  We explore the role of DNA methylation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To elucidate where DNA methylation falls along the causal pathway linking risk factors to disease, we examine causal models to assess its role in the pathology of AD. 
  Methods:  DNA methylation profiles were generated in 740 brain samples using the Illumina HumanMet450K beadset. We focused our analysis on CpG sites from 11 AD susceptibility gene regions. The primary outcome was a quantitative measure of neuritic amyloid plaque (NP), a key early element of AD pathology. We tested four causal models: (1) independent associations, (2) CpG mediating the association of a variant, (3) reverse causality, and (4) genetic variant by CpG interaction. 
  Results:  Six genes regions (17 CpGs) showed evidence of CpG associations with NP, independent of genetic variation - BIN1 (5), CLU (5), MS4A6A (3), ABCA7 (2), CD2AP (1), and APOE (1). Together they explained 16.8% of the variability in NP. An interaction effect was seen in the CR1 region for two CpGs, cg10021878 (P = 0.01) and cg05922028 (P = 0.001), in relation to NP. In both cases, subjects with the risk allele rs6656401(AT) (/) (AA) display more methylation being associated with more NP burden, whereas subjects with the rs6656401(TT) protective genotype have an inverse association with more methylation being associated with less NP. 
  Interpretation:  These observations suggest that, within known AD susceptibility loci, methylation is related to pathologic processes of AD and may play a largely independent role by influencing gene expression in AD susceptibility loci.

Senescence-accelerated OXYS rats develop AMD-like retinopathy. The aim of this study was to explore the differences in retinal gene expression between OXYS and Wistar (control) rats at age 20 d and to identify the pathways of retinal cell death involved in the OXYS retinopathy initiation and progression. Retinal mRNA profiles of 20-day-old OXYS and Wistar rats were generated at the sequencing read depth 40 mln, in triplicate, using Illumina GAIIx. A terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed to measure the apoptosis level. GeneMANIA was used to construct interaction networks for differentially expressed (DE) apoptosis-related genes at ages 20 d and 3 and 18 months. Functional analysis was suggestive of a developmental process, signal transduction, and cell differentiation as the most enriched biological processes among 245 DE genes at age 20 d An increased level of apoptosis was observed in OXYS rats at age 20 d but not at advanced stages. We identified functional clusters in the constructed interaction networks and possible hub genes (Rasa1, cFLAR, Birc3, Cdk1, Hspa1b, Erbb3, and Ntf3). We also demonstrated the significance of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway at preclinical, early, and advanced stages of retinopathy development. Besides the cell death signaling pathways, immune system-related processes and lipid-metabolic processes showed overrepresentation in the clusters of all networks. These characteristics of the expression profile of the genes functionally associated with apoptosis may contribute to the pathogenesis of AMD-like retinopathy in senescence-accelerated OXYS rats.

10.1007/s12021-014-9254-1  |  Other  |  Prognosis  |  Bayesian network classifiers  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   An accepted classification of GABAergic interneurons of the cerebral cortex is a major goal in neuroscience. A recently proposed taxonomy based on patterns of axonal arborization promises to be a pragmatic method for achieving this goal. It involves characterizing interneurons according to five axonal arborization features, called F1-F5, and classifying them into a set of predefined types, most of which are established in the literature. Unfortunately, there is little consensus among expert neuroscientists regarding the morphological definitions of some of the proposed types. While supervised classifiers were able to categorize the interneurons in accordance with experts' assignments, their accuracy was limited because they were trained with disputed labels. Thus, here we automatically classify interneuron subsets with different label reliability thresholds (i.e., such that every cell's label is backed by at least a certain (threshold) number of experts). We quantify the cells with parameters of axonal and dendritic morphologies and, in order to predict the type, also with axonal features F1-F4 provided by the experts. Using Bayesian network classifiers, we accurately characterize and classify the interneurons and identify useful predictor variables. In particular, we discriminate among reliable examples of common basket, horse-tail, large basket, and Martinotti cells with up to 89.52% accuracy, and single out the number of branches at 180 μm from the soma, the convex hull 2D area, and the axonal features F1-F4 as especially useful predictors for distinguishing among these types. These results open up new possibilities for an objective and pragmatic classification of interneurons.

Synthetic retinoids represent a class of compounds with anti-cancer activity. Here, we report the preclinical activity of a new member of this class, the ST1926-derivative ST5589, in lymphomas. ST5589 presented a dose-dependent anti-proliferative activity in almost all of the 25 lymphoma cell lines analysed, with a median 50% inhibitory concentration of 433 nM. Apoptosis was observed in 8/11 cell lines. ST5589 induced changes in the gene expression profiles of the cell lines, including the down-regulation of Aurora Kinase A (AURKA). Specific gene expression signatures were associated with a higher sensitivity to the compound and combination of ST5589 with carfilzomib revealed the importance of proteasome activity in mediating the anti-tumour activity of ST5589. In conclusion, we have identified a new mechanism of action of atypical retinoids as anti-cancer compounds, and the encouraging results obtained with the new ST1926-derivative ST5589 provide the basis for further developments of the compound.

This involves the generation of large and small droplets from the tip of a glass capillary and the selective transfer of small droplets through an oil-water interface, thus resulting in the generation of cell-sized liposomes. We demonstrate control of the microdomain formation as well as the formation of asymmetric lipid bilayer liposomes of uniform size by the control of lipid composition. The DSSF method involves simple microfluidics and is easy to use. In addition, only a small volume (0.5-2 μL) of sample solution is required for the formation of hundreds of cell-sized liposomes. We believe that this method can be applied to generate cell-sized liposomes for a wide variety of uses, such as the construction of artificial cell-like systems.

Qualitative surveys with open-ended questions were performed among inmates from rooms where outbreaks occurred to learn about pruno consumption. Quantitative surveys assessed knowledge gained after the outbreaks and preferred information sources. For the quantitative surveys, 250 inmates were randomly selected by bed from across the correctional facility and 164 inmates were interviewed. Only 24% of inmates reported any botulism knowledge before the outbreaks and education outreach, whereas 73% reported knowledge after the outbreaks (p &lt; .01). Preferred information sources included handouts/fliers (52%) and the prison television channel (32%).

We conducted a state-of-the-art review and literature synthesis of peer-reviewed and gray literature published since 2004. The review prioritized randomized trials and studies focused on cardiovascular diseases and risk factors, but included other reports when they represented the best available evidence. The search emphasized reports on the potential benefits of mHealth interventions implemented in low- and middle-income countries. Interactive voice response and short message service interventions can improve cardiovascular preventive care in developed countries by addressing risk factors including weight, smoking, and physical activity. Interactive voice response and short message service-based interventions for cardiovascular disease management also have shown benefits with respect to hypertension management, hospital readmissions, and diabetic glycemic control. Multimodal interventions including Web-based communication with clinicians and mHealth-enabled clinical monitoring with feedback also have shown benefits. The evidence regarding the potential benefits of interventions using smartphones and social media is still developing. Studies of mHealth interventions have been conducted in &gt;30 low- and middle-income countries, and evidence to date suggests that programs are feasible and may improve medication adherence and disease outcomes. Emerging evidence suggests that mHealth interventions may improve cardiovascular-related lifestyle behaviors and disease management. Next-generation mHealth programs developed worldwide should be based on evidence-based behavioral theories and incorporate advances in artificial intelligence for adapting systems automatically to patients' unique and changing needs.

To discover biomarkers and/or genes involved in ALK-negative ALCL pathogenesis, we applied the cancer outlier profile analysis algorithm to a gene expression profiling data set including 249 cases of T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and normal T cells. Ectopic coexpression of ERBB4 and COL29A1 genes was detected in 24% of ALK-negative ALCL patients. RNA sequencing and 5' RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends identified 2 novel ERBB4-truncated transcripts displaying intronic transcription start sites. By luciferase assays, we defined that the expression of ERBB4-aberrant transcripts is promoted by endogenous intronic long terminal repeats. ERBB4 expression was confirmed at the protein level by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Lastly, we demonstrated that ERBB4-truncated forms show oncogenic potentials and that ERBB4 pharmacologic inhibition partially controls ALCL cell growth and disease progression in an ERBB4-positive patient-derived tumorgraft model. In conclusion, we identified a new subclass of ALK-negative ALCL characterized by aberrant expression of ERBB4-truncated transcripts carrying intronic 5' untranslated regions.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.01.048  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis, Smart Healthcare  |  multi-class classification  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Algorithms for computer-aided diagnosis of dementia based on structural MRI have demonstrated high performance in the literature, but are difficult to compare as different data sets and methodology were used for evaluation. In addition, it is unclear how the algorithms would perform on previously unseen data, and thus, how they would perform in clinical practice when there is no real opportunity to adapt the algorithm to the data at hand. To address these comparability, generalizability and clinical applicability issues, we organized a grand challenge that aimed to objectively compare algorithms based on a clinically representative multi-center data set. Using clinical practice as the starting point, the goal was to reproduce the clinical diagnosis. Therefore, we evaluated algorithms for multi-class classification of three diagnostic groups: patients with probable Alzheimer's disease, patients with mild cognitive impairment and healthy controls. The diagnosis based on clinical criteria was used as reference standard, as it was the best available reference despite its known limitations. For evaluation, a previously unseen test set was used consisting of 354 T1-weighted MRI scans with the diagnoses blinded. Fifteen research teams participated with a total of 29 algorithms. The algorithms were trained on a small training set (n=30) and optionally on data from other sources (e.g., the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle flagship study of aging). The best performing algorithm yielded an accuracy of 63.0% and an area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) of 78.8%. In general, the best performances were achieved using feature extraction based on voxel-based morphometry or a combination of features that included volume, cortical thickness, shape and intensity. The challenge is open for new submissions via the web-based framework: http://caddementia.grand-challenge.org.

10.1016/S2213-2600(15)00335-5  |  Epidemiology  |  Epidemiology  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) has been infrequently reported historically, and is typically associated with isolated cases or small clusters of respiratory illness. Beginning in August, 2014, increases in severe respiratory illness associated with EV-D68 were reported across the USA. We aimed to describe the clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory features of this outbreak, and to better understand the role of EV-D68 in severe respiratory illness. 
  Methods:  We collected regional syndromic surveillance data for epidemiological weeks 23 to 44, 2014, (June 1 to Nov 1, 2014) and hospital admissions data for epidemiological weeks 27 to 44, 2014, (June 29 to Nov 1, 2014) from three states: Missouri, Illinois and Colorado. Data were also collected for the same time period of 2013 and 2012. Respiratory specimens from severely ill patients nationwide, who were rhinovirus-positive or enterovirus-positive in hospital testing, were submitted between Aug 1, and Oct 31, 2014, and typed by molecular sequencing. We collected basic clinical and epidemiological characteristics of EV-D68 cases with a standard data collection form submitted with each specimen. We compared patients requiring intensive care with those who did not, and patients requiring ventilator support with those who did not. Mantel-Haenszel χ(2) tests were used to test for statistical significance. 
  Findings:  Regional and hospital-level data from Missouri, Illinois, and Colorado showed increases in respiratory illness between August and September, 2014, compared with in 2013 and 2012. Nationwide, 699 (46%) of 1529 patients tested were confirmed as EV-D68. Among the 614 EV-D68-positive patients admitted to hospital, age ranged from 3 days to 92 years (median 5 years). Common symptoms included dyspnoea (n=513 [84%]), cough (n=500 [81%]), and wheezing (n=427 [70%]); 294 (48%) patients had fever. 338 [59%] of 574 were admitted to intensive care units, and 145 (28%) of 511 received ventilator support; 322 (52%) of 614 had a history of asthma or reactive airway disease; 200 (66%) of 304 patients with a history of asthma or reactive airway disease required intensive care compared with 138 (51%) of 270 with no history of asthma or reactive airway disease (p=0·0004). Similarly, 89 (32%) of 276 patients with a history of asthma or reactive airway disease required ventilator support compared with 56 (24%) of 235 patients with no history of asthma or reactive airway disease (p=0·039). 
  Interpretation:  In 2014, EV-D68 caused widespread severe respiratory illness across the USA, disproportionately affecting those with asthma. This unexpected event underscores the need for robust surveillance of enterovirus types, enabling improved understanding of virus circulation and disease burden.

10.1073/pnas.1415603112  |  Genetics  |  Smart Healthcare, Genetics  |  massively expedited genome-wide heritability analysis  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   The discovery and prioritization of heritable phenotypes is a computational challenge in a variety of settings, including neuroimaging genetics and analyses of the vast phenotypic repositories in electronic health record systems and population-based biobanks. Classical estimates of heritability require twin or pedigree data, which can be costly and difficult to acquire. Genome-wide complex trait analysis is an alternative tool to compute heritability estimates from unrelated individuals, using genome-wide data that are increasingly ubiquitous, but is computationally demanding and becomes difficult to apply in evaluating very large numbers of phenotypes. Here we present a fast and accurate statistical method for high-dimensional heritability analysis using genome-wide SNP data from unrelated individuals, termed massively expedited genome-wide heritability analysis (MEGHA) and accompanying nonparametric sampling techniques that enable flexible inferences for arbitrary statistics of interest. MEGHA produces estimates and significance measures of heritability with several orders of magnitude less computational time than existing methods, making heritability-based prioritization of millions of phenotypes based on data from unrelated individuals tractable for the first time to our knowledge. As a demonstration of application, we conducted heritability analyses on global and local morphometric measurements derived from brain structural MRI scans, using genome-wide SNP data from 1,320 unrelated young healthy adults of non-Hispanic European ancestry. We also computed surface maps of heritability for cortical thickness measures and empirically localized cortical regions where thickness measures were significantly heritable. Our analyses demonstrate the unique capability of MEGHA for large-scale heritability-based screening and high-dimensional heritability profile construction.

Although R-loops are normal transcriptional intermediates, they are also associated with genomic instability. Here, we show that BRCA1 is recruited to R-loops that form normally over a subset of transcription termination regions. There it mediates the recruitment of a specific, physiological binding partner, senataxin (SETX). Disruption of this complex led to R-loop-driven DNA damage at those loci as reflected by adjacent γ-H2AX accumulation and ssDNA breaks within the untranscribed strand of relevant R-loop structures. Genome-wide analysis revealed widespread BRCA1 binding enrichment at R-loop-rich termination regions (TRs) of actively transcribed genes. Strikingly, within some of these genes in BRCA1 null breast tumors, there are specific insertion/deletion mutations located close to R-loop-mediated BRCA1 binding sites within TRs. Thus, BRCA1/SETX complexes support a DNA repair mechanism that addresses R-loop-based DNA damage at transcriptional pause sites.

To identify new protein/pathway alterations and candidate biomarkers for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we performed comparative proteomic profiling of CSF from sporadic ALS (sALS), healthy control (HC), and other neurological disease (OND) subjects using label-free liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A total of 1712 CSF proteins were detected and relatively quantified by spectral counting. Levels of several proteins with diverse biological functions were significantly altered in sALS samples. Enrichment analysis was used to link these alterations to biological pathways, which were predominantly related to inflammation, neuronal activity, and extracellular matrix regulation. We then used our CSF proteomic profiles to create a support vector machines classifier capable of discriminating training set ALS from non-ALS (HC and OND) samples. Four classifier proteins, WD repeat-containing protein 63, amyloid-like protein 1, SPARC-like protein 1, and cell adhesion molecule 3, were identified by feature selection and externally validated. The resultant classifier distinguished ALS from non-ALS samples with 83% sensitivity and 100% specificity in an independent test set. Collectively, our results illustrate the utility of CSF proteomic profiling for identifying ALS protein/pathway alterations and candidate disease biomarkers.

This species has a large genome with significant population-based size variation. The complete genome sequence was determined for the Foshan strain, an established laboratory colony derived from wild mosquitoes from southeastern China, a region within the historical range of the origin of the species. The genome comprises 1,967 Mb, the largest mosquito genome sequenced to date, and its size results principally from an abundance of repetitive DNA classes. In addition, expansions of the numbers of members in gene families involved in insecticide-resistance mechanisms, diapause, sex determination, immunity, and olfaction also contribute to the larger size. Portions of integrated flavivirus-like genomes support a shared evolutionary history of association of these viruses with their vector. The large genome repertory may contribute to the adaptability and success of Ae. albopictus as an invasive species.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.07.087  |  Diagnosis, Treatment  |  Diagnosis, Treatment  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Structural MRI is widely used for investigating brain atrophy in many neurodegenerative disorders, with several research groups developing and publishing techniques to provide quantitative assessments of this longitudinal change. Often techniques are compared through computation of required sample size estimates for future clinical trials. However interpretation of such comparisons is rendered complex because, despite using the same publicly available cohorts, the various techniques have been assessed with different data exclusions and different statistical analysis models. We created the MIRIAD atrophy challenge in order to test various capabilities of atrophy measurement techniques. The data consisted of 69 subjects (46 Alzheimer's disease, 23 control) who were scanned multiple (up to twelve) times at nine visits over a follow-up period of one to two years, resulting in 708 total image sets. Nine participating groups from 6 countries completed the challenge by providing volumetric measurements of key structures (whole brain, lateral ventricle, left and right hippocampi) for each dataset and atrophy measurements of these structures for each time point pair (both forward and backward) of a given subject. From these results, we formally compared techniques using exactly the same dataset. First, we assessed the repeatability of each technique using rates obtained from short intervals where no measurable atrophy is expected. For those measures that provided direct measures of atrophy between pairs of images, we also assessed symmetry and transitivity. Then, we performed a statistical analysis in a consistent manner using linear mixed effect models. The models, one for repeated measures of volume made at multiple time-points and a second for repeated "direct" measures of change in brain volume, appropriately allowed for the correlation between measures made on the same subject and were shown to fit the data well. From these models, we obtained estimates of the distribution of atrophy rates in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) and control groups and of required sample sizes to detect a 25% treatment effect, in relation to healthy ageing, with 95% significance and 80% power over follow-up periods of 6, 12, and 24months. Uncertainty in these estimates, and head-to-head comparisons between techniques, were carried out using the bootstrap. The lateral ventricles provided the most stable measurements, followed by the brain. The hippocampi had much more variability across participants, likely because of differences in segmentation protocol and less distinct boundaries. Most methods showed no indication of bias based on the short-term interval results, and direct measures provided good consistency in terms of symmetry and transitivity. The resulting annualized rates of change derived from the model ranged from, for whole brain: -1.4% to -2.2% (AD) and -0.35% to -0.67% (control), for ventricles: 4.6% to 10.2% (AD) and 1.2% to 3.4% (control), and for hippocampi: -1.5% to -7.0% (AD) and -0.4% to -1.4% (control). There were large and statistically significant differences in the sample size requirements between many of the techniques. The lowest sample sizes for each of these structures, for a trial with a 12month follow-up period, were 242 (95% CI: 154 to 422) for whole brain, 168 (95% CI: 112 to 282) for ventricles, 190 (95% CI: 146 to 268) for left hippocampi, and 158 (95% CI: 116 to 228) for right hippocampi. This analysis represents one of the most extensive statistical comparisons of a large number of different atrophy measurement techniques from around the globe. The challenge data will remain online and publicly available so that other groups can assess their methods.

Like Ebola virus, Lassa virus (LASV) can cause hemorrhagic fever with high case fatality rates. We generated a genomic catalog of almost 200 LASV sequences from clinical and rodent reservoir samples. We show that whereas the 2013-2015 EVD epidemic is fueled by human-to-human transmissions, LASV infections mainly result from reservoir-to-human infections. We elucidated the spread of LASV across West Africa and show that this migration was accompanied by changes in LASV genome abundance, fatality rates, codon adaptation, and translational efficiency. By investigating intrahost evolution, we found that mutations accumulate in epitopes of viral surface proteins, suggesting selection for immune escape. This catalog will serve as a foundation for the development of vaccines and diagnostics. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

10.1186/s13059-015-0628-y  |  Genetics  |  Diagnosis, Drug Discovery, Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Sociality has many rewards, but can also be dangerous, as high population density and low genetic diversity, common in social insects, is ideal for parasite transmission. Despite this risk, honeybees and other sequenced social insects have far fewer canonical immune genes relative to solitary insects. Social protection from infection, including behavioral responses, may explain this depauperate immune repertoire. Here, based on full genome sequences, we describe the immune repertoire of two ecologically and commercially important bumblebee species that diverged approximately 18 million years ago, the North American Bombus impatiens and European Bombus terrestris. 
  Results:  We find that the immune systems of these bumblebees, two species of honeybee, and a solitary leafcutting bee, are strikingly similar. Transcriptional assays confirm the expression of many of these genes in an immunological context and more strongly in young queens than males, affirming Bateman's principle of greater investment in female immunity. We find evidence of positive selection in genes encoding antiviral responses, components of the Toll and JAK/STAT pathways, and serine protease inhibitors in both social and solitary bees. Finally, we detect many genes across pathways that differ in selection between bumblebees and honeybees, or between the social and solitary clades. 
  Conclusions:  The similarity in immune complement across a gradient of sociality suggests that a reduced immune repertoire predates the evolution of sociality in bees. The differences in selection on immune genes likely reflect divergent pressures exerted by parasites across social contexts.

A total of 877 (594 from Hantangang and 283 from Imjingang) fishes were examined by the artificial digestion methods. Clonorchis sinensis metacercariae were detected in 7 (1.2%) fishes (in 3 spp.) from Hantangang in Cheorwon-gun, Gangwon-do, and 40 (14.1%) fishes (in 7 spp.) from Munsancheon in Paju-si, Gyeonggi-do. The average densities were 1.9 and 35.6 per fish infected, respectively. Metagonimus spp. metacercariae were detected in 312 (52.5%) and 113 (39.9%) fishes from Hantangang and Imjingang, and their average densities were 47.5 and 9.6 per fish infected, respectively. Centrocestus armatus metacercariae were found in 161 (27.1%) and 70 (24.7%) fishes from Hantangang and Imjingang, and their average number per fish infected was 694 and 82, respectively. Echinostoma spp. metacercariae were detected in 50 (8.4%) and 94 (33.2%) fishes from Hantangang and Imjingang, and their average densities were 9.6 and 23.1 per fish infected, respectively. The infection status of fishes with metacercariae of Stephanoprora spp., Diplostomum spp., Clinostomum complanatum, Metorchis orientalis, and Metorchis taiwanensis were analyzed by surveyed regions. Conclusively, it was confirmed that C. sinensis metacercariae were quite commonly detected in fishes from Munsancheon but rarely from other localities, whereas the metacercariae of other digenetic trematodes were relatively prevalent in fishes from water systems of Hantangang and Imjingang in Korea.

Although a few renowned alleles are well characterized, functional information is missing for over 100,000 disease-associated variants. Here we functionally profile several thousand missense mutations across a spectrum of Mendelian disorders using various interaction assays. The majority of disease-associated alleles exhibit wild-type chaperone binding profiles, suggesting they preserve protein folding or stability. While common variants from healthy individuals rarely affect interactions, two-thirds of disease-associated alleles perturb protein-protein interactions, with half corresponding to "edgetic" alleles affecting only a subset of interactions while leaving most other interactions unperturbed. With transcription factors, many alleles that leave protein-protein interactions intact affect DNA binding. Different mutations in the same gene leading to different interaction profiles often result in distinct disease phenotypes. Thus disease-associated alleles that perturb distinct protein activities rather than grossly affecting folding and stability are relatively widespread.

To date, imaging genetic studies have mostly focused on discovering isolated genetic effects, typically ignoring potential interactions with non-genetic variables such as disease risk factors, environmental exposures, and epigenetic markers. However, identifying significant interaction effects is critical for revealing the true relationship between genetic and phenotypic variables, and shedding light on disease mechanisms. In this paper, we present a general kernel machine based method for detecting effects of the interaction between multidimensional variable sets. This method can model the joint and epistatic effect of a collection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), accommodate multiple factors that potentially moderate genetic influences, and test for nonlinear interactions between sets of variables in a flexible framework. As a demonstration of application, we applied the method to the data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to detect the effects of the interactions between candidate Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk genes and a collection of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, on hippocampal volume measurements derived from structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Our method identified that two genes, CR1 and EPHA1, demonstrate significant interactions with CVD risk factors on hippocampal volume, suggesting that CR1 and EPHA1 may play a role in influencing AD-related neurodegeneration in the presence of CVD risks.

Loss of 7q31 and somatic mutations affecting the NOTCH2 and KLF2 genes are the commonest genomic aberrations. Epigenetic changes can be pharmacologically reverted; therefore, identification of groups of patients with specific epigenomic alterations might have therapeutic relevance. Here we integrated genome-wide DNA-promoter methylation profiling with gene expression profiling, and clinical and biological variables. An unsupervised clustering analysis of a test series of 98 samples identified 2 clusters with different degrees of promoter methylation. The cluster comprising samples with higher-promoter methylation (High-M) had a poorer overall survival compared with the lower (Low-M) cluster. The prognostic relevance of the High-M phenotype was confirmed in an independent validation set of 36 patients. In the whole series, the High-M phenotype was associated with IGHV1-02 usage, mutations of NOTCH2 gene, 7q31-32 loss, and histologic transformation. In the High-M set, a number of tumor-suppressor genes were methylated and repressed. PRC2 subunit genes and several prosurvival lymphoma genes were unmethylated and overexpressed. A model based on the methylation of 3 genes (CACNB2, HTRA1, KLF4) identified a poorer-outcome patient subset. Exposure of splenic marginal zone lymphoma cell lines to a demethylating agent caused partial reversion of the High-M phenotype and inhibition of proliferation.

10.1056/NEJMoa1502214  |  Genetics, Treatment  |  Prognosis, Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Genomewide association studies can be used to identify disease-relevant genomic regions, but interpretation of the data is challenging. The FTO region harbors the strongest genetic association with obesity, yet the mechanistic basis of this association remains elusive. 
  Methods:  We examined epigenomic data, allelic activity, motif conservation, regulator expression, and gene coexpression patterns, with the aim of dissecting the regulatory circuitry and mechanistic basis of the association between the FTO region and obesity. We validated our predictions with the use of directed perturbations in samples from patients and from mice and with endogenous CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in samples from patients. 
  Results:  Our data indicate that the FTO allele associated with obesity represses mitochondrial thermogenesis in adipocyte precursor cells in a tissue-autonomous manner. The rs1421085 T-to-C single-nucleotide variant disrupts a conserved motif for the ARID5B repressor, which leads to derepression of a potent preadipocyte enhancer and a doubling of IRX3 and IRX5 expression during early adipocyte differentiation. This results in a cell-autonomous developmental shift from energy-dissipating beige (brite) adipocytes to energy-storing white adipocytes, with a reduction in mitochondrial thermogenesis by a factor of 5, as well as an increase in lipid storage. Inhibition of Irx3 in adipose tissue in mice reduced body weight and increased energy dissipation without a change in physical activity or appetite. Knockdown of IRX3 or IRX5 in primary adipocytes from participants with the risk allele restored thermogenesis, increasing it by a factor of 7, and overexpression of these genes had the opposite effect in adipocytes from nonrisk-allele carriers. Repair of the ARID5B motif by CRISPR-Cas9 editing of rs1421085 in primary adipocytes from a patient with the risk allele restored IRX3 and IRX5 repression, activated browning expression programs, and restored thermogenesis, increasing it by a factor of 7. 
  Conclusions:  Our results point to a pathway for adipocyte thermogenesis regulation involving ARID5B, rs1421085, IRX3, and IRX5, which, when manipulated, had pronounced pro-obesity and anti-obesity effects. (Funded by the German Research Center for Environmental Health and others.).

Recognizing patients with CID/HIES is of clinical importance because of the difference in prognosis and management. 
  Objectives:  We sought to define the clinical features that distinguish DOCK8 deficiency from other forms of HIES and CIDs, study the mutational spectrum of DOCK8 deficiency, and report on the frequency of specific clinical findings. 
  Methods:  Eighty-two patients from 60 families with CID and the phenotype of AR-HIES with (64 patients) and without (18 patients) DOCK8 mutations were studied. Support vector machines were used to compare clinical data from 35 patients with DOCK8 deficiency with those from 10 patients with AR-HIES without a DOCK8 mutation and 64 patients with signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) mutations. 
  Results:  DOCK8-deficient patients had median IgE levels of 5201 IU, high eosinophil levels of usually at least 800/μL (92% of patients), and low IgM levels (62%). About 20% of patients were lymphopenic, mainly because of low CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell counts. Fewer than half of the patients tested produced normal specific antibody responses to recall antigens. Bacterial (84%), viral (78%), and fungal (70%) infections were frequently observed. Skin abscesses (60%) and allergies (73%) were common clinical problems. In contrast to STAT3 deficiency, there were few pneumatoceles, bone fractures, and teething problems. Mortality was high (34%). A combination of 5 clinical features was helpful in distinguishing patients with DOCK8 mutations from those with STAT3 mutations. 
  Conclusions:  DOCK8 deficiency is likely in patients with severe viral infections, allergies, and/or low IgM levels who have a diagnosis of HIES plus hypereosinophilia and upper respiratory tract infections in the absence of parenchymal lung abnormalities, retained primary teeth, and minimal trauma fractures.

Thus, the morphometric analysis of the neuronal soma is highly subjective. In this paper, we provide a mathematical definition and an automatic segmentation method to delimit the neuronal soma. We applied this method to the characterization of pyramidal cells, which are the most abundant neurons in the cerebral cortex. Since there are no benchmarks with which to compare the proposed procedure, we validated the goodness of this automatic segmentation method against manual segmentation by neuroanatomists to set up a framework for comparison. We concluded that there were no significant differences between automatically and manually segmented somata, i.e., the proposed procedure segments the neurons similarly to how a neuroanatomist does. It also provides univocal, justifiable and objective cutoffs. Thus, this study is a means of characterizing pyramidal neurons in order to objectively compare the morphometry of the somata of these neurons in different cortical areas and species.

10.1371/journal.pone.0142685  |  None  |  None, Other  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   The main finding of this paper is a novel avalanche-size exponent τ ≈ 1.87 when the generalised sandpile dynamics evolves on the real-world Japanese inter-firm network. The topology of this network is non-layered and directed, displaying the typical bow tie structure found in real-world directed networks, with cycles and triangles. We show that one can move from a strictly layered regular lattice to a more fluid structure of the inter-firm network in a few simple steps. Relaxing the regular lattice structure by introducing an interlayer distribution for the interactions, forces the scaling exponent of the avalanche-size probability density function τ out of the two-dimensional directed sandpile universality class τ = 4/3, into the mean field universality class τ = 3/2. Numerical investigation shows that these two classes are the only that exist on the directed sandpile, regardless of the underlying topology, as long as it is strictly layered. Randomly adding a small proportion of links connecting non adjacent layers in an otherwise layered network takes the system out of the mean field regime to produce non-trivial avalanche-size probability density function. Although these do not display proper scaling, they closely reproduce the behaviour observed on the Japanese inter-firm network.

Here, we show that PRC2 is required to maintain expression of maternal microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) from the Gtl2-Rian-Mirg locus, which is essential for full pluripotency of iPSCs. In the absence of PRC2, the entire locus becomes transcriptionally repressed due to gain of DNAme at the intergenic differentially methylated regions (IG-DMRs). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the IG-DMR serves as an enhancer of the maternal Gtl2-Rian-Mirg locus. Further analysis reveals that PRC2 interacts physically with Dnmt3 methyltransferases and reduces recruitment to and subsequent DNAme at the IG-DMR, thereby allowing for proper expression of the maternal Gtl2-Rian-Mirg locus. Our observations are consistent with a mechanism through which PRC2 counteracts the action of Dnmt3 methyltransferases at an imprinted locus required for full pluripotency.

10.1186/1758-2946-7-S1-S2  |  Other  |  Diagnosis  |  supervised named entity recognition, text mining  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   The automatic extraction of chemical information from text requires the recognition of chemical entity mentions as one of its key steps. When developing supervised named entity recognition (NER) systems, the availability of a large, manually annotated text corpus is desirable. Furthermore, large corpora permit the robust evaluation and comparison of different approaches that detect chemicals in documents. We present the CHEMDNER corpus, a collection of 10,000 PubMed abstracts that contain a total of 84,355 chemical entity mentions labeled manually by expert chemistry literature curators, following annotation guidelines specifically defined for this task. The abstracts of the CHEMDNER corpus were selected to be representative for all major chemical disciplines. Each of the chemical entity mentions was manually labeled according to its structure-associated chemical entity mention (SACEM) class: abbreviation, family, formula, identifier, multiple, systematic and trivial. The difficulty and consistency of tagging chemicals in text was measured using an agreement study between annotators, obtaining a percentage agreement of 91. For a subset of the CHEMDNER corpus (the test set of 3,000 abstracts) we provide not only the Gold Standard manual annotations, but also mentions automatically detected by the 26 teams that participated in the BioCreative IV CHEMDNER chemical mention recognition task. In addition, we release the CHEMDNER silver standard corpus of automatically extracted mentions from 17,000 randomly selected PubMed abstracts. A version of the CHEMDNER corpus in the BioC format has been generated as well. We propose a standard for required minimum information about entity annotations for the construction of domain specific corpora on chemical and drug entities. The CHEMDNER corpus and annotation guidelines are available at: http://www.biocreative.org/resources/biocreative-iv/chemdner-corpus/.

However, the diversity of the HCV genome is a major obstacle for the development of antiviral drugs, vaccines, and genotyping assays. In this large-scale analysis, genome-wide diversity and selective pressure was mapped, focusing on positions important for treatment, drug resistance, and resistance testing. A dataset of 1415 full-genome sequences, including genotypes 1-6 from the Los Alamos database, was analyzed. In 44% of all full-genome positions, the consensus amino acid was different for at least one genotype. Focusing on positions sharing the same consensus amino acid in all genotypes revealed that only 15% was defined as pan-genotypic highly conserved (≥99% amino acid identity) and an additional 24% as pan-genotypic conserved (≥95%). Despite its large genetic diversity, across all genotypes, codon positions were rarely identified to be positively selected (0.23%-0.46%) and predominantly found to be under negative selective pressure, suggesting mainly neutral evolution. For NS3, NS5A, and NS5B, respectively, 40% (6/15), 33% (3/9), and 14% (2/14) of the resistance-related positions harbored as consensus the amino acid variant related to resistance, potentially impeding treatment. For example, the NS3 variant 80K, conferring resistance to simeprevir used for treatment of HCV1 infected patients, was present in 39.3% of the HCV1a strains and 0.25% of HCV1b strains. Both NS5A variants 28M and 30S, known to be associated with resistance to the pan-genotypic drug daclatasvir, were found in a significant proportion of HCV4 strains (10.7%). NS5B variant 556G, known to confer resistance to non-nucleoside inhibitor dasabuvir, was observed in 8.4% of the HCV1b strains. Given the large HCV genetic diversity, sequencing efforts for resistance testing purposes may need to be genotype-specific or geographically tailored.

To address this need, the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium generated the largest collection so far of human epigenomes for primary cells and tissues. Here we describe the integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes generated as part of the programme, profiled for histone modification patterns, DNA accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression. We establish global maps of regulatory elements, define regulatory modules of coordinated activity, and their likely activators and repressors. We show that disease- and trait-associated genetic variants are enriched in tissue-specific epigenomic marks, revealing biologically relevant cell types for diverse human traits, and providing a resource for interpreting the molecular basis of human disease. Our results demonstrate the central role of epigenomic information for understanding gene regulation, cellular differentiation and human disease.

Thus, a multiple-lab study on craniofacial superimposition has been carried out for the first time. In particular, 26 participants from 17 different institutions in 13 countries were asked to deal with 14 identification scenarios, some of them involving the comparison of multiple candidates and unknown skulls. In total, 60 craniofacial superimposition problems divided in two set of females and males. Each participant follow her/his own methodology and employed her/his particular technological means. For each single case they were asked to report the final identification decision (either positive or negative) along with the rationale supporting the decision and at least one image illustrating the overlay/superimposition outcome. This study is expected to provide important insights to better understand the most convenient characteristics of every method included in this study.

In this paper, we presents a novel method for feature selection with the use of opposite sign test (OST) as a local search for the electromagnetism-like mechanism (EM) algorithm, denoted as improved electromagnetism-like mechanism (IEM) algorithm. Nearest neighbor algorithm is served as a classifier for the wrapper method. The proposed IEM algorithm is compared with nine popular feature selection and classification methods. Forty-six datasets from the UCI repository and eight gene expression microarray datasets are collected for comprehensive evaluation. Non-parametric statistical tests are conducted to justify the performance of the methods in terms of classification accuracy and Kappa index. The results confirm that the proposed IEM method is superior to the common state-of-art methods. Furthermore, we apply IEM to predict the occurrence of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) after a gestational DM. Our research helps identify the risk factors for this disease; accordingly accurate diagnosis and prognosis can be achieved to reduce the morbidity and mortality rate caused by DM.

Botulism was confirmed in eight men aged 20 to 35 years who reported sharing a single batch of pruno made with potatoes. Initial symptoms included blurred vision, slurred speech, muscle weakness, ptosis, and dysphagia. All patients received heptavalent botulinum antitoxin, seven required mechanical ventilation, and all survived. The median incubation period was 29 hours. Sera from all patients and leftover pruno tested positive for botulinum toxin type A. Botulism should be considered among prisoners with cranial nerve palsies and descending, symmetric flaccid paralysis. Prison-brewed alcohol, particularly when made with potatoes, can be a vehicle for botulism and is associated with outbreaks of botulism in prisons.

10.2196/rehab.4109  |  Diagnosis, Treatment  |  Diagnosis, Treatment  |  expert system, nearest neighbour algorithm, automated profiling  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Peer support is an emerging form of person-driven active health care. Chronic conditions such as Ménière's disease (a disorder of the inner ear) need continuing rehabilitation and support that is beyond the scope of routine clinical medical practice. Hence, peer-support programs can be helpful in supplementing some of the rehabilitation aspects. 
  Objective:  The aim of this study was to design a computerized data collection system for the peer support of Menière's disease that is capable in profiling the subject for diagnosis and in assisting with problem solving. 
  Methods:  The expert program comprises several data entries focusing on symptoms, activity limitations, participation restrictions, quality of life, attitude and personality trait, and an evaluation of disease-specific impact. Data was collected from 740 members of the Finnish Ménière's Federation and utilized in the construction and evaluation of the program. 
  Results:  The program verifies the diagnosis of a person by using an expert system, and the inference engine selects 50 cases with matched symptom severity by using a nearest neighbor algorithm. These cases are then used as a reference group to compare with the person's attitude, sense of coherence, and anxiety. The program provides feedback for the person and uses this information to guide the person through the problem-solving process. 
  Conclusions:  This computer-based peer-support program is the first example of an advanced computer-oriented approach using artificial intelligence, both in the profiling of the disease and in profiling the person's complaints for hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo.

In order to help generate new research hypotheses, this study explored spatial and temporal patterns of preterm birth in a large, total-population dataset. 
  Methods:  Data on 145 million US births in 3,000 counties from the Natality Files of the National Center for Health Statistics for 1971-2011 were examined. State trends in early (&lt;34 wk) and late (34-36 wk) preterm birth rates were compared. K-means cluster analyses were conducted to identify gestational age distribution patterns for all US counties over time. 
  Results:  A weak association was observed between state trends in &lt;34 wk birth rates and the initial absolute &lt;34 wk birth rate. Significant associations were observed between trends in &lt;34 wk and 34-36 wk birth rates and between white and African American &lt;34 wk births. Periodicity was observed in county-level trends in &lt;34 wk birth rates. Cluster analyses identified periods of significant heterogeneity and homogeneity in gestational age distributional trends for US counties. 
  Conclusion:  The observed geographic and temporal patterns suggest periodicity and complex, shared influences among preterm birth rates in the United States. These patterns could provide insight into promising hypotheses for further research.

10.1007/s00234-015-1556-y  |  Prognosis  |  Prognosis  |  Independent Component Analysis  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Introduction:  Our study is using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to evaluate functional connectivity changes in Parkinson's disease (PD) in an unbiased manner. 
  Methods:  Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data was collected for 27 PD patients and 16 healthy subjects. Differences for intra- and inter-network connectivity between healthy subjects and patients were investigated using FMRIB Software Library (FSL) tools (Melodic ICA, dual regression, FSLNets). 
  Results:  Twenty-three ICA maps were identified as components of neuronal origin. For intra-network connectivity changes, eight components showed a significant connectivity increase in patients (p &lt; 0.05); these were correlated with clinical scores and were largest for (sensori)motor networks. For inter-network connectivity changes, we found higher connectivity between the sensorimotor network and the spatial attention network (p = 0.0098) and lower connectivity between anterior and posterior default mode networks (DMN) (p = 0.024), anterior DMN and visual recognition networks (p = 0.026), as well as between visual attention and main dorsal attention networks (p = 0.03), for patients as compared to healthy subjects. The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve for the best predictor (partial correlation between sensorimotor and spatial attention networks) was 0.772. These functional alterations were not associated with any gray or white matter structural changes. 
  Conclusion:  Our results show higher connectivity between sensorimotor and spatial attention areas in patients that may be related to the reduced movement automaticity in PD.

10.1039/c4an01806k  |  Treatment, Drug Discovery  |  Drug Discovery  |  cluster-based comparison algorithm  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   We evaluated the use of the peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) obtained by matrix assisted laser desorption and ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) to track changes in the structure of a protein. The first problem we had to overcome was the inherent complexity of the PMF, which makes it difficult to compare. We dealt with this problem by developing a cluster-based comparison algorithm which takes into account the proportional error made by the mass spectrometer. This procedure involves grouping together similar masses in an intelligent manner, so that we can determine which data correspond to the same peptide (any slight differences can be explained as experimental errors), and which of them are too different and thus more likely to represent different peptides. The proposed algorithm was applied to track changes in a commercially available monoclonal antibody (mAb), namely rituximab (RTX), prepared under the usual hospital conditions and stored refrigerated (4 °C) and frozen (-20 °C) for a long term study. PMFs were obtained periodically over three months. For each checked time, five replicates of the PMFs were obtained in order to evaluate the similarities between them by means of the occurrences of the particular peptides (m/z). After applying the algorithm to the PMF, different approaches were used to analyse the results. Surprisingly, all of them suggested that there were no differences between the two storage conditions tested, i.e. the RTX samples were almost equally well preserved when stored refrigerated at 4 °C or frozen at -20 °C. The cluster-based methodology is new in protein mass spectrometry and could be useful as an easy test for major changes in proteins and biopharmaceutics for diverse applications in industry and other fields, and could provide additional stability data in relation to the practical use of anticancer drugs.

10.1371/journal.pgen.1005550  |  Genetics  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   The human mutation rate is an essential parameter for studying the evolution of our species, interpreting present-day genetic variation, and understanding the incidence of genetic disease. Nevertheless, our current estimates of the rate are uncertain. Most notably, recent approaches based on counting de novo mutations in family pedigrees have yielded significantly smaller values than classical methods based on sequence divergence. Here, we propose a new method that uses the fine-scale human recombination map to calibrate the rate of accumulation of mutations. By comparing local heterozygosity levels in diploid genomes to the genetic distance scale over which these levels change, we are able to estimate a long-term mutation rate averaged over hundreds or thousands of generations. We infer a rate of 1.61 ± 0.13 × 10-8 mutations per base per generation, which falls in between phylogenetic and pedigree-based estimates, and we suggest possible mechanisms to reconcile our estimate with previous studies. Our results support intermediate-age divergences among human populations and between humans and other great apes.

Various lncRNAs have been implicated in the modulation of chromatin structure, transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation, and regulation of genomic stability in mammals, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster. The purpose of this study is to identify the lncRNA landscape in the malaria vector An. gambiae and assess the evolutionary conservation of lncRNAs and their secondary structures across the Anopheles genus. 
  Results:  Using deep RNA sequencing of multiple Anopheles gambiae life stages, we have identified 2,949 lncRNAs and more than 300 previously unannotated putative protein-coding genes. The lncRNAs exhibit differential expression profiles across life stages and adult genders. We find that across the genus Anopheles, lncRNAs display much lower sequence conservation than protein-coding genes. Additionally, we find that lncRNA secondary structure is highly conserved within the Gambiae complex, but diverges rapidly across the rest of the genus Anopheles. 
  Conclusions:  This study offers one of the first lncRNA secondary structure analyses in vector insects. Our description of lncRNAs in An. gambiae offers the most comprehensive genome-wide insights to date into lncRNAs in this vector mosquito, and defines a set of potential targets for the development of vector-based interventions that may further curb the human malaria burden in disease-endemic countries.

10.1126/science.1259435  |  Genetics  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   The availability of genome sequences from 16 anopheline species provides unprecedented opportunities to study the evolution of reproductive traits relevant for malaria transmission. In Anopheles gambiae, a likely candidate for sexual selection is male 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). Sexual transfer of this steroid hormone as part of a mating plug dramatically changes female physiological processes intimately tied to vectorial capacity. By combining phenotypic studies with ancestral state reconstructions and phylogenetic analyses, we show that mating plug transfer and male 20E synthesis are both derived characters that have coevolved in anophelines, driving the adaptation of a female 20E-interacting protein that promotes oogenesis via mechanisms also favoring Plasmodium survival. Our data reveal coevolutionary dynamics of reproductive traits between the sexes likely to have shaped the ability of anophelines to transmit malaria.

10.1162/ARTL_a_00164  |  Robotics  |  Robotics  |  imitation learning  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   This article describes research in which embodied imitation and behavioral adaptation are investigated in collective robotics. We model social learning in artificial agents with real robots. The robots are able to observe and learn each others' movement patterns using their on-board sensors only, so that imitation is embodied. We show that the variations that arise from embodiment allow certain behaviors that are better adapted to the process of imitation to emerge and evolve during multiple cycles of imitation. As these behaviors are more robust to uncertainties in the real robots' sensors and actuators, they can be learned by other members of the collective with higher fidelity. Three different types of learned-behavior memory have been experimentally tested to investigate the effect of memory capacity on the evolution of movement patterns, and results show that as the movement patterns evolve through multiple cycles of imitation, selection, and variation, the robots are able to, in a sense, agree on the structure of the behaviors that are imitated.

10.1186/s12859-015-0666-1  |  Genetics  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Scoring DNA sequences against Position Weight Matrices (PWMs) is a widely adopted method to identify putative transcription factor binding sites. While common bioinformatics tools produce scores that can reflect the binding strength between a specific transcription factor and the DNA, these scores are not directly comparable between different transcription factors. Other methods, including p-value associated approaches (Touzet H, Varré J-S. Efficient and accurate p-value computation for position weight matrices. Algorithms Mol Biol. 2007;2(1510.1186):1748-7188), provide more rigorous ways to identify potential binding sites, but their results are difficult to interpret in terms of binding energy, which is essential for the modeling of transcription factor binding dynamics and enhancer activities. 
  Results:  Here, we provide two different ways to find the scaling parameter λ that allows us to infer binding energy from a PWM score. The first approach uses a PWM and background genomic sequence as input to estimate λ for a specific transcription factor, which we applied to show that λ distributions for different transcription factor families correspond with their DNA binding properties. Our second method can reliably convert λ between different PWMs of the same transcription factor, which allows us to directly compare PWMs that were generated by different approaches. 
  Conclusion:  These two approaches provide computationally efficient ways to scale PWM scores and estimate the strength of transcription factor binding sites in quantitative studies of binding dynamics. Their results are consistent with each other and previous reports in most of cases.

10.1371/journal.pone.0143204  |  Genetics  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Sterility is a serious problem that can affect all bionts. In teleosts, double haploids (DHs) induced by mitogynogenesis are often sterile. This sterility severely restricts the further application of DHs for production of clones, genetic analysis, and breeding. However, sterile DH individuals are good source materials for investigation of the molecular mechanisms of gonad development, especially for studies into the role of genes that are indispensable for fish reproduction. Here, we used the Illumina sequencing platform to analyze the transcriptome of sterile female DH Japanese flounder in order to identify major genes that cause sterility and to provide a molecular basis for an intensive study of gonadal development in teleosts. Through sequencing, assembly, and annotation, we obtained 52,474 contigs and found that 60.7% of these shared homologies with existing sequences. A total of 1225 differentially expressed unigenes were found, including 492 upregulated and 733 downregulated genes. Gene Ontology and KEGG analyses showed that genes showing significant upregulation, such as CYP11A1, CYP11B2, CYP17, CYP21, HSD3β, bcl2l1, and PRLR, principally correlated with sterol metabolic process, steroid biosynthetic process, and the Jak-stat signaling pathway. The significantly downregulated genes were primarily associated with immune response, antigen processing and presentation, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and protein digestion and absorption. Using a co-expression network analysis, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of gene expression in the gonads of fertile and sterile female DH Japanese flounder. Identification of genes showing significantly different expression will provide further insights into DH reproductive dysfunction and oocyte maturation processes in teleosts.

This study addresses whether seeds are passive carriers or engage a molecular dialogue with pathogens during their development. We developed two pathosystems using Medicago truncatula with Xanthomonas alfalfae subsp. alfalfae (Xaa), the natural Medicago sp. pathogen and Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc), a Brassicaceae pathogen. Three days after flower inoculation, the transcriptome of Xcc-infected pods showed activation of an innate immune response that was strongly limited in Xcc mutated in the type three secretion system, demonstrating an incompatible interaction of Xcc with the reproductive structures. In contrast, the presence of Xaa did not result in an activation of defence genes. Transcriptome profiling during development of infected seeds exhibited time-dependent and differential responses to Xcc and Xaa. Gene network analysis revealed that the transcriptome of Xcc-infected seeds was mainly affected during seed filling whereas that of Xaa-infected seeds responded during late maturation. The Xcc-infected seed transcriptome exhibited an activation of defence response and a repression of targeted seed maturation pathways. Fifty-one percent of putative ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3 targets were deregulated by Xcc, including oleosin, cupin, legumin and chlorophyll degradation genes. At maturity, these seeds displayed decreased weight and increased chlorophyll content. In contrast, these traits were not affected by Xaa infection. These findings demonstrate the existence of a complex molecular dialogue between xanthomonads and developing seeds and provides insights into a previously unexplored trade-off between seed development and pathogen defence.

10.1016/j.jvs.2015.02.038  |  Prognosis  |  Prognosis  |  artificial neural networks  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Review  |    Objective:  Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) carries a high mortality rate, even with prompt transfer to a medical center. An artificial neural network (ANN) is a computational model that improves predictive ability through pattern recognition while continually adapting to new input data. The goal of this study was to effectively use ANN modeling to provide vascular surgeons a discriminant adjunct to assess the likelihood of in-hospital mortality on a pending rAAA admission using easily obtainable patient information from the field. 
  Methods:  Of 332 total patients from a single institution from 1998 to 2013 who had attempted rAAA repair, 125 were reviewed for preoperative factors associated with in-hospital mortality; 108 patients received an open operation, and 17 patients received endovascular repair. Five variables were found significant on multivariate analysis (P &lt; .05), and four of these five (preoperative shock, loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and age) were modeled by multiple logistic regression and an ANN. These predictive models were compared against the Glasgow Aneurysm Score. All models were assessed by generation of receiver operating characteristic curves and actual vs predicted outcomes plots, with area under the curve and Pearson r(2) value as the primary measures of discriminant ability. 
  Results:  Of the 125 patients, 53 (42%) did not survive to discharge. Five preoperative factors were significant (P &lt; .05) independent predictors of in-hospital mortality in multivariate analysis: advanced age, renal disease, loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and shock, although renal disease was excluded from the models. The sequential accumulation of zero to four of these risk factors progressively increased overall mortality rate, from 11% to 16% to 44% to 76% to 89% (age ≥ 70 years considered a risk factor). Algorithms derived from multiple logistic regression, ANN, and Glasgow Aneurysm Score models generated area under the curve values of 0.85 ± 0.04, 0.88 ± 0.04 (training set), and 0.77 ± 0.06 and Pearson r(2) values of .36, .52 and .17, respectively. The ANN model represented the most discriminant of the three. 
  Conclusions:  An ANN-based predictive model may represent a simple, useful, and highly discriminant adjunct to the vascular surgeon in accurately identifying those patients who may carry a high mortality risk from attempted repair of rAAA, using only easily definable preoperative variables. Although still requiring external validation, our model is available for demonstration at https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/surveys/?s=NN97NM7DTK.

Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and meta-analyses have successfully identified numerous type 1 DM-associated susceptibility loci, the underlying mechanisms for these susceptibility loci are currently largely unclear. 
  Methods:  Based on publicly available datasets, we performed integrative analyses (i.e., integrated gene relationships among implicated loci, differential gene expression analysis, functional prediction and functional annotation clustering analysis) and combined with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) results to further explore function mechanisms underlying the associations between genetic variants and type 1 DM. 
  Results:  Among a total of 183 type 1 DM-associated SNPs, eQTL analysis showed that 17 SNPs with cis-regulated eQTL effects on 9 genes. All the 9 eQTL genes enrich in immune-related pathways or Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Functional prediction analysis identified 5 SNPs located in transcription factor (TF) binding sites. Of the 9 eQTL genes, 6 (TAP2, HLA-DOB, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DRB5 and CTSH) were differentially expressed in type 1 DM-associated related cells. Especially, rs3825932 in CTSH has integrative functional evidence supporting the association with type 1 DM. 
  Conclusions:  These findings indicated that integrative analyses can yield important functional information to link genetic variants and type 1 DM.

10.1038/ncomms8440  |  Genetics  |  Prognosis, Genetics  |  microarray analysis  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Transcription activator-like effector (TALE) proteins recognize DNA using a seemingly simple DNA-binding code, which makes them attractive for use in genome engineering technologies that require precise targeting. Although this code is used successfully to design TALEs to target specific sequences, off-target binding has been observed and is difficult to predict. Here we explore TALE-DNA interactions comprehensively by quantitatively assaying the DNA-binding specificities of 21 representative TALEs to ∼5,000-20,000 unique DNA sequences per protein using custom-designed protein-binding microarrays (PBMs). We find that protein context features exert significant influences on binding. Thus, the canonical recognition code does not fully capture the complexity of TALE-DNA binding. We used the PBM data to develop a computational model, Specificity Inference For TAL-Effector Design (SIFTED), to predict the DNA-binding specificity of any TALE. We provide SIFTED as a publicly available web tool that predicts potential genomic off-target sites for improved TALE design.

10.1093/hmg/ddv345  |  Genetics  |  Genetics  |  microarray analysis  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Type 2 brittle cornea syndrome (BCS2) is an inherited connective tissue disease with a devastating ocular phenotype caused by mutations in the transcription factor PR domain containing 5 (PRDM5) hypothesized to exert epigenetic effects through histone and DNA methylation. Here we investigate clinical samples, including skin fibroblasts and retinal tissue from BCS2 patients, to elucidate the epigenetic role of PRDM5 and mechanisms of its dysregulation in disease. First we report abnormal retinal vascular morphology in the eyes of two cousins with BCS2 (PRDM5 Δ exons 9-14) using immunohistochemistry, and mine data from skin fibroblast expression microarrays from patients with PRDM5 mutations p.Arg590* and Δ exons 9-14, as well as from a PRDM5 ChIP-sequencing experiment. Gene ontology analysis of dysregulated PRDM5-target genes reveals enrichment for extracellular matrix (ECM) genes supporting vascular integrity and development. Q-PCR and ChIP-qPCR confirm upregulation of critical mediators of ECM stability in vascular structures (COL13A1, COL15A1, NTN1, CDH5) in patient fibroblasts. We identify H3K9 di-methylation (H3K9me2) at these PRDM5-target genes in fibroblasts, and demonstrate that the BCS2 mutation p.Arg83Cys diminishes interaction of PRDM5 with repressive complexes, including NuRD complex protein CHD4, and the repressive chromatin interactor HP1BP3, by co-immunoprecipitation combined with mass spectrometry. We observe reduced heterochromatin protein 1 binding protein 3 (HP1BP3) staining in the retinas of two cousins lacking exons 9-14 by immunohistochemistry, and dysregulated H3K9me2 in skin fibroblasts of three patients (p.Arg590*, p.Glu134* and Δ exons 9-14) by western blotting. These findings suggest that defective interaction of PRDM5 with repressive complexes, and dysregulation of H3K9me2, play a role in PRDM5-associated disease.

Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate how CTD affects the expression of key genes and functional pathways of human H460 lung cancer cells using complementary DNA microarray analysis. Human H460 lung cancer cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of 10 µM CTD; gene expression was then examined using microarray analysis. The results indicated that 8 genes were upregulated &gt; 4-fold, 29 genes were upregulated &gt;3-4-fold and 156 genes were upregulated &gt;2-3-fold. In addition, 1 gene was downregulated &gt;4 fold, 14 genes were downregulated &gt;3-4-fold and 150 genes were downregulated &gt;2-3 fold in H460 cells following exposure to CTD. It was found that CTD affected DNA damage genes, including DNIT3 and GADD45A, which were upregulated 2.26- and 2.60-fold, respectively, as well as DdiT4, which was downregulated 3.14-fold. In addition, the expression of genes associated with the cell cycle progression were altered, including CCND2, CDKL3 and RASA4, which were upregulated 2.72-, 2.19- and 2.72-fold, respectively; however, CDC42EP3 was downregulated 2.16-fold. Furthermore, apoptosis-associated genes were differentially expressed, including CARD6, which was upregulated 3.54-fold. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that CTD affected the expression of genes associated with DNA damage, cell cycle progression and apoptotic cell death in human lung cancer H460 cells.

10.1111/jipb.12347  |  Genetics  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Root architecture is crucial for plants to absorb water and nutrients. We previously reported edt1 (edt1D) mutant with altered root architecture that contributes significantly to drought resistance. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Here we report one of the mechanisms underlying EDT1/HDG11-conferred altered root architecture. Root transcriptome comparison between the wild type and edt1D revealed that the upregulated genes involved in jasmonate biosynthesis and signaling pathway were enriched in edt1D root, which were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. Further analysis showed that EDT1/HDG11, as a transcription factor, bound directly to the HD binding sites in the promoters of AOS, AOC3, OPR3, and OPCL1, which encode four key enzymes in JA biosynthesis. We found that the jasmonic acid level was significantly elevated in edt1D root compared with that in the wild type subsequently. In addition, more auxin accumulation was observed in the lateral root primordium of edt1D compared with that of wild type. Genetic analysis of edt1D opcl1 double mutant also showed that HDG11 was partially dependent on JA in regulating LR formation. Taken together, overexpression of EDT1/HDG11 increases JA level in the root of edt1D by directly upregulating the expressions of several genes encoding JA biosynthesis enzymes to activate auxin signaling and promote lateral root formation.

GnRHRs have been found in extra-pituitary tissues, including prostate, which may be affected by the GnRH and GnRH analogues used in therapy. The direct effect of degarelix on human prostate cell growth was evaluated. Normal prostate myofibroblast WPMY-1 and epithelial WPE1-NA22 cells, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)-1 cells, androgen-independent PC-3 and androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cells, as well as VCaP cells derived from a patient with castration-resistant prostate cancer were used. Discriminatory protein and lipid fingerprints of normal, hyperplastic, and cancer cells were generated by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS). The investigated cell lines express GNRHR1 and GNRHR2 and their endogenous ligands. Degarelix treatment reduced cell viability in all prostate cell lines tested, with the exception of the PC-3 cells; this can be attributed to increased apoptosis, as indicated by increased caspase 3/7, 8 and 9 levels. WPE1-NA22, BPH-1, LNCaP, and VCaP cell viability was not affected by treatment with the GnRH agonists leuprolide and goserelin. Using MALDI MS, we detected changes in m/z signals that were robust enough to create a complete discriminatory profile induced by degarelix. Transcriptomic analysis of BPH-1 cells provided a global map of genes affected by degarelix and indicated that the biological processes affected were related to cell growth, G-coupled receptors, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, angiogenesis and cell adhesion. Taken together, these data demonstrate that (i) the GnRH antagonist degarelix exerts a direct effect on prostate cell growth through apoptosis; (ii) MALDI MS analysis provided a basis to fingerprint degarelix-treated prostate cells; and (iii) the clusters of genes affected by degarelix suggest that this compound, in addition to its known use in the treatment of prostate cancer, may be efficacious in BPH.

10.1104/pp.15.00510  |  Genetics  |  Genetics  |  microarray analysis  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Dormancy is a complex evolutionary trait that temporally prevents seed germination, thus allowing seedling growth at a favorable season. High-throughput analyses of transcriptomes have led to significant progress in understanding the molecular regulation of this process, but the role of posttranscriptional mechanisms has received little attention. In this work, we have studied the dynamics of messenger RNA association with polysomes and compared the transcriptome with the translatome in dormant and nondormant seeds of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) during their imbibition at 25 °C in darkness, a temperature preventing germination of dormant seeds only. DNA microarray analysis revealed that 4,670 and 7,028 transcripts were differentially abundant in dormant and nondormant seeds in the transcriptome and the translatome, respectively. We show that there is no correlation between transcriptome and translatome and that germination regulation is also largely translational, implying a selective and dynamic recruitment of messenger RNAs to polysomes in both dormant and nondormant seeds. The study of 5' untranslated region features revealed that GC content and the number of upstream open reading frames could play a role in selective translation occurring during germination. Gene Ontology clustering showed that the functions of polysome-associated transcripts differed between dormant and nondormant seeds and revealed actors in seed dormancy and germination. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the essential role of selective polysome loading in this biological process.

The need for an increased range of analyzed bacteria coupled with the obtainment of rapid and early results justify the development of a DNA microarray for the identification of waterborne pathogens. This DNA microarray has 16 implanted probes with a median size of 147 bases, targeting 12 different parameters, including all mandatory indicator microorganisms, such as Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, total and fecal coliforms and enterococci. The validation performed with DNA extracted from pure microbial cultures showed the suitability of the probes for detection of the target microorganism. To overcome the high dilution of water samples it was included either a prior culture step of bacterial contaminants retained after filtering 100 ml of water, or a 10-fold increase in the volume of filtered water, that resulted in the increase of the detected bacteria. The analysis of complex environmental water samples using culture methods and the DNA microarray revealed that the latter detected the same parameters plus other bacteria tested only in the DNA microarray. The results show that this DNA microarray may be a useful tool for water microbiological surveillance.

Pathogen effectors act transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally to suppress defense responses. A major challenge to understanding disease and defense responses is discriminating between transcriptional reprogramming associated with microbial-associated molecular pattern (MAMP)-triggered immunity (MTI) and that orchestrated by effectors. A high-resolution time course of genome-wide expression changes following challenge with Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 and the nonpathogenic mutant strain DC3000hrpA- allowed us to establish causal links between the activities of pathogen effectors and suppression of MTI and infer with high confidence a range of processes specifically targeted by effectors. Analysis of this information-rich data set with a range of computational tools provided insights into the earliest transcriptional events triggered by effector delivery, regulatory mechanisms recruited, and biological processes targeted. We show that the majority of genes contributing to disease or defense are induced within 6 h postinfection, significantly before pathogen multiplication. Suppression of chloroplast-associated genes is a rapid MAMP-triggered defense response, and suppression of genes involved in chromatin assembly and induction of ubiquitin-related genes coincide with pathogen-induced abscisic acid accumulation. Specific combinations of promoter motifs are engaged in fine-tuning the MTI response and active transcriptional suppression at specific promoter configurations by P. syringae.

10.3233/JAD-141623  |  Prognosis  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Drug Discovery  |  network analysis  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   There is growing evidence that the human brain is a large scale complex network. The structural network is reported to be disrupted in cognitively impaired patients. However, there have been few studies evaluating the effects of amyloid and small vessel disease (SVD) markers, the common causes of cognitive impairment, on structural networks. Thus, we evaluated the association between amyloid and SVD burdens and structural networks using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Furthermore, we determined if network parameters predict cognitive impairments. Graph theoretical analysis was applied to DTI data from 232 cognitively impaired patients with varying degrees of amyloid and SVD burdens. All patients underwent Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB) PET to detect amyloid burden, MRI to detect markers of SVD, including the volume of white matter hyperintensities and the number of lacunes, and detailed neuropsychological testing. The whole-brain network was assessed by network parameters of integration (shortest path length, global efficiency) and segregation (clustering coefficient, transitivity, modularity). PiB retention ratio was not associated with any white matter network parameters. Greater white matter hyperintensity volumes or lacunae numbers were significantly associated with decreased network integration (increased shortest path length, decreased global efficiency) and increased network segregation (increased clustering coefficient, increased transitivity, increased modularity). Decreased network integration or increased network segregation were associated with poor performances in attention, language, visuospatial, memory, and frontal-executive functions. Our results suggest that SVD alters white matter network integration and segregation, which further predicts cognitive dysfunction.

The factors that affect such differences in susceptibility remain unknown. A Bos taurus genome-wide gene chip was used to analyze gene expression profiles in the peripheral blood of water buffalo and yellow cattle pre- and post-infection with S. japonicum. This study showed that most of the identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between water buffalo and yellow cattle pre- and post-infection were involved in immune-related processes, and the expression level of immune genes was lower in water buffalo. The unique DEGs (390) in yellow cattle were mainly associated with inflammation pathways, while the unique DEGs (2,114) in water buffalo were mainly associated with immune-related factors. The 83 common DEGs may be the essential response genes during S. japonicum infection, the highest two gene ontology (GO) functions were associated with the regulation of fibrinolysis. The pathway enrichment analysis showed that the DEGs constituted similar immune-related pathways pre- and post-infection between the two hosts. This first analysis of the transcriptional profiles of natural hosts has enabled us to gain new insights into the mechanisms that govern their susceptibility or resistance to S. japonicum infections.

  Method:  In vitro, the effect of repaglinide on the metabolism of pioglitazone was assessed in pooled human liver microsomes. In silico, an IVIVE-PBPK linked model was built with Simcyp®. Then, a randomized, 2-phase cross-over clinical study was conducted in 12 healthy volunteers. 
  Results:  Repaglinide showed a strong inhibitory effect on the metabolism of pioglitazone in vitro (Ki = 0.0757 µm), [I]/Ki &gt; 0.1. The Simcyp® prediction ratios of AUC and Cmax between the two treatment groups were both about 1.01. The pharmacokinetics of pioglitazone in clinical trials showed no significant difference between these two treatment groups (p &gt; 0.05). 
  Conclusion:  Repaglinide has no significant inhibitory effect on the metabolism of pioglitazone in vivo, which is inconsistent with the in vitro results. The lack of an inhibitory effect was partly due to extensive plasma protein binding and to the high in vivo clearance of repaglinide, for the concentration of repaglinide in vivo was far smaller than in vitro.

10.1242/dev.109454  |  Prognosis, Genetics  |  Genetics  |  transcriptome analysis  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Balancing stem cell self-renewal and initiation of lineage specification programs is essential for the development and homeostasis of the hematopoietic system. We have specifically ablated geminin in the developing murine hematopoietic system and observed profound defects in the generation of mature blood cells, leading to embryonic lethality. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) accumulated in the fetal liver following geminin ablation, while committed progenitors were reduced. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis identified key HSC transcription factors as being upregulated upon geminin deletion, revealing a gene network linked with geminin that controls fetal hematopoiesis. In order to obtain mechanistic insight into the ability of geminin to regulate transcription, we examined Hoxa9 as an example of a key gene in definitive hematopoiesis. We demonstrate that in human K562 cells geminin is associated with HOXA9 regulatory elements and its absence increases HOXA9 transcription similarly to that observed in vivo. Moreover, silencing geminin reduced recruitment of the PRC2 component SUZ12 to the HOXA9 locus and resulted in an increase in RNA polymerase II recruitment and H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), whereas the repressive marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 were reduced. The chromatin landscape was also modified at the regulatory regions of HOXA10 and GATA1. K562 cells showed a reduced ability to differentiate to erythrocytes and megakaryocytes upon geminin silencing. Our data suggest that geminin is indispensable for fetal hematopoiesis and regulates the generation of a physiological pool of stem and progenitor cells in the fetal hematopoietic system.

The investigation of attentional modulation in high-level visual areas, however, is hampered by the lack of clear tuning or contrast response functions. In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging study we therefore systematically assessed how small voxel-wise biases in object preference across hundreds of voxels in the lateral occipital complex were affected when attention was directed to objects. We found that the strength of attentional modulation depended on a voxel's object preference in the absence of attention, a pattern indicative of an amplificatory mechanism. Our results show that such attentional modulation effectively increased the mutual information between voxel responses and object identity. Further, these local modulatory effects led to improved information-based object readout at the level of multi-voxel activation patterns and to an increased reproducibility of these patterns across repeated presentations. We conclude that attentional modulation enhances object coding in local and distributed object representations of the lateral occipital complex.

With a sufficiently large sample number, these microbial communities can be explored by constructing and analyzing co-occurrence networks, which detect taxon associations from abundance data and can give insights into community structure. Here, we investigate how co-occurrence networks differ across biomes and which other factors influence their properties. For this, we inferred microbial association networks from 20 different 16S rDNA sequencing data sets and observed that soil microbial networks harbor proportionally fewer positive associations and are less densely interconnected than host-associated networks. After excluding sample number, sequencing depth and beta-diversity as possible drivers, we found a negative correlation between community evenness and positive edge percentage. This correlation likely results from a skewed distribution of negative interactions, which take place preferentially between less prevalent taxa. Overall, our results suggest an under-appreciated role of evenness in shaping microbial association networks.

The relevance of micro-RNAs as regulators of the legume-rhizobia nitrogen-fixing symbiosis is emerging. The objective of this work was to functionally characterize the role of micro-RNA172 (miR172) and its conserved target APETALA2 (AP2) transcription factor in the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris)-Rhizobium etli symbiosis. Our expression analysis revealed that mature miR172c increased upon rhizobial infection and continued increasing during nodule development, reaching its maximum in mature nodules and decaying in senescent nodules. The expression of AP2-1 target showed a negative correlation with miR172c expression. A drastic decrease in miR172c and high AP2-1 mRNA levels were observed in ineffective nodules. Phenotypic analysis of composite bean plants with transgenic roots overexpressing miR172c or a mutated AP2-1 insensitive to miR172c cleavage demonstrated the pivotal regulatory role of the miR172 node in the common bean-rhizobia symbiosis. Increased miR172 resulted in improved root growth, increased rhizobial infection, increased expression of early nodulation and autoregulation of nodulation genes, and improved nodulation and nitrogen fixation. In addition, these plants showed decreased sensitivity to nitrate inhibition of nodulation. Through transcriptome analysis, we identified 114 common bean genes that coexpressed with AP2-1 and proposed these as being targets for transcriptional activation by AP2-1. Several of these genes are related to nodule senescence, and we propose that they have to be silenced, through miR172c-induced AP2-1 cleavage, in active mature nodules. Our work sets the basis for exploring the miR172-mediated improvement of symbiotic nitrogen fixation in common bean, the most important grain legume for human consumption.

Differences in implementation, assumptions, and evaluations have made comparison of these models very difficult. Taxonomies have been constructed in an attempt at the organization and classification of models, but are not sufficient at quantifying which classes of models are most capable of explaining available data. At the same time, a multitude of physiological and behavioral findings have been published, measuring various aspects of human and non-human primate visual attention. All of these elements highlight the need to integrate the computational models with the data by (1) operationalizing the definitions of visual attention tasks and (2) designing benchmark datasets to measure success on specific tasks, under these definitions. In this paper, we provide some examples of operationalizing and benchmarking different visual attention tasks, along with the relevant design considerations.

A key challenge in elucidating the nature of these systems, and for engineering manufacturing methods inspired by biochemical reactions, is to attain a comprehensive understanding of the stereochemical ground rules of enzymatic reactions. Here, we present a model of catalysis that can be performed magnetically by centimetre-sized passive floating units. The designed system, which is equipped with permanent magnets only, passively obeys the local causalities imposed by magnetic interactions, albeit it shows a spatial behaviour and an energy profile analogous to those of biochemical enzymes. In this process, the enzyme units trigger physical conformation changes of the target by levelling out the magnetic potential barrier (activation potential) to a funnel type and, thus, induce cascading conformation changes of the targeted substrate units reacting in parallel. The inhibitor units, conversely, suppress such changes by increasing the potential. Because the model is purely mechanical and established on a physics basis in the absence of turbulence, each performance can be explained by the morphology of the unit, extending the definition of catalysis to systems of alternative scales.

10.1186/s12976-015-0006-1  |  Treatment  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Treatment  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Despite a vast literature, atherosclerosis and the associated ischemia/reperfusion injuries remain today in many ways a mystery. Why do atheromatous plaques make and store a supply of cholesterol and sulfate within the major arteries supplying the heart? Why are treatment programs aimed to suppress certain myocardial infarction risk factors, such as elevated serum homocysteine and inflammation, generally counterproductive? 
  Methods:  Our methods are based on an extensive search of the literature in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease as well as in the area of the unique properties of water, the role of biosulfates in the vascular wall, and the role of electromagnetic fields in vascular flow. Our investigation reveals a novel pathology linked to atherosclerosis that better explains the observed facts than the currently held popular view. 
  Results:  We propose a novel theory that atherosclerosis can best be explained as being due to cholesterol sulfate deficiency. Furthermore, atheromatous plaques replenish the supply of cholesterol and sulfate to the microvasculature, by exploiting the inflammatory agent superoxide to derive sulfate from homocysteine and other sulfur sources. We argue that the sulfate anions attached to the glycosaminoglycans in the glycocalyx are essential in maintaining the structured water that is crucial for vascular endothelial health and erythrocyte mobility through capillaries. Sulfate depletion leads to cholesterol accumulation in atheromas, because its transport through water-based media depends on sulfurylation. We show that streaming potential induces nitric oxide (NO) release, and NO derivatives break down the extracellular matrix, redistributing sulfate to the microvasculature. We argue that low (less negative) zeta potential due to insufficient sulfate anions leads to hypertension and thrombosis, because these responses can increase streaming potential and induce nitric-oxide mediated vascular relaxation, promoting oxygen delivery. Our hypothesis is a parsimonious explanation of multiple features of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 
  Conclusions:  If our interpretation is correct, then it would have a significant impact on how atherosclerosis is treated. We recommend a high intake of sulfur-containing foods as well as an avoidance of exposure to toxicants that may impair sulfate synthesis.

10.1038/ng.3190  |  Genetics  |  Genetics  |  statistical analysis  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Linear mixed models are a powerful statistical tool for identifying genetic associations and avoiding confounding. However, existing methods are computationally intractable in large cohorts and may not optimize power. All existing methods require time cost O(MN(2)) (where N is the number of samples and M is the number of SNPs) and implicitly assume an infinitesimal genetic architecture in which effect sizes are normally distributed, which can limit power. Here we present a far more efficient mixed-model association method, BOLT-LMM, which requires only a small number of O(MN) time iterations and increases power by modeling more realistic, non-infinitesimal genetic architectures via a Bayesian mixture prior on marker effect sizes. We applied BOLT-LMM to 9 quantitative traits in 23,294 samples from the Women's Genome Health Study (WGHS) and observed significant increases in power, consistent with simulations. Theory and simulations show that the boost in power increases with cohort size, making BOLT-LMM appealing for genome-wide association studies in large cohorts.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.07.066  |  Other  |  None, Other  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   While several cortical regions have been highlighted for their category selectivity (e.g., scene-selective regions like the parahippocampal place area, object selective regions like the lateral occipital complex), a growing trend in cognitive neuroscience has been to investigate what particular perceptual properties these regions calculate. Classical scene-selective regions have been particularly targeted in recent work as being sensitive to object size or other related properties. Here we test to which extent these regions are sensitive to spatial information of stimuli at any size. We introduce the spatial object property of "interaction envelope," defined as the space through which a user transverses to interact with an object. In two functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments, we examined activity in a comprehensive set of perceptual regions of interest for when human participants viewed object images varying along the dimensions of interaction envelope and physical size. Importantly, we controlled for confounding perceptual and semantic object properties. We find that scene-selective regions are in fact sensitive to object interaction envelope for small, manipulable objects regardless of real-world size and task. Meanwhile, small-scale entity regions maintain selectivity to stimulus physical size. These results indicate that regions traditionally associated with scene processing may not be solely sensitive to larger object and scene information, but instead are calculating local spatial information of objects and scenes of all sizes.

Although companies such as Google and Apple are nearly synonymous with innovation, virtually all sectors in our current lives are imbued with yearn for innovation. This has led to organizational focus on innovative strategies as well as recruitment of chief innovation officers and teams in a myriad of organizations. At times, however, the word innovation seems like an overused cliché, as there are now more than 5,000 books in print with the word "innovation" in the title. More recently, innovation has garnered significant attention in health care. The future of health care is expected to innovate on a large scale in order to deliver sustained value for an overall transformative care. To date, there are no published reports on the state of the art in innovation in pediatric health care and in particular, pediatric cardiac intensive care. This report will address the issue of innovation in pediatric medicine with relevance to cardiac intensive care and delineate possible future directions and strategies in pediatric cardiac intensive care.

Proteomic analysis of their signaling pathways promises to enhance our understanding of cancer aberrations at the functional level, but this requires accurate and robust tools. Here, we develop a state of the art quantitative mass spectrometric pipeline to characterize formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of patients with closely related subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We combined a super-SILAC approach with label-free quantification (hybrid LFQ) to address situations where the protein is absent in the super-SILAC standard but present in the patient samples. Shotgun proteomic analysis on a quadrupole Orbitrap quantified almost 9,000 tumor proteins in 20 patients. The quantitative accuracy of our approach allowed the segregation of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients according to their cell of origin using both their global protein expression patterns and the 55-protein signature obtained previously from patient-derived cell lines (Deeb, S. J., D'Souza, R. C., Cox, J., Schmidt-Supprian, M., and Mann, M. (2012) Mol. Cell. Proteomics 11, 77-89). Expression levels of individual segregation-driving proteins as well as categories such as extracellular matrix proteins behaved consistently with known trends between the subtypes. We used machine learning (support vector machines) to extract candidate proteins with the highest segregating power. A panel of four proteins (PALD1, MME, TNFAIP8, and TBC1D4) is predicted to classify patients with low error rates. Highly ranked proteins from the support vector analysis revealed differential expression of core signaling molecules between the subtypes, elucidating aspects of their pathobiology.

We examined the U87, U251, and U373 malignant cell lines as in vitro models to determine the impact of cellular cross-talk on their phenotypic alterations in co-cultures. These cells were also studied at the transcriptome level, to define the mechanisms of their observed mutually affected genomic stability, proliferation, invasion and resistance to temozolomide. This is the first direct demonstration of the neural and mesenchymal molecular fingerprints of U87 and U373 cells, respectively. U87-cell conditioned medium lowered the genomic stability of U373 (U251) cells, without affecting cell proliferation. In contrast, upon exposure of U87 cells to U373 (U251) conditioned medium, U87 cells showed increased genomic stability, decreased proliferation rates and increased invasion, due to a plethora of produced cytokines identified in the co-culture media. This cross talk altered the expression 264 genes in U87 cells that are associated with proliferation, inflammation, migration, and adhesion, and 221 genes in U373 cells that are associated with apoptosis, the cell cycle, cell differentiation and migration. Indirect and direct co-culturing of U87 and U373 cells showed mutually opposite effects on temozolomide resistance. In conclusion, definition of transcriptional alterations of distinct glioblastoma cells upon co-culturing provides better understanding of the mechanisms of glioblastoma heterogeneity, which will provide the basis for more informed glioma treatment in the future.

An important problem in protein structure determination using NMR spectroscopy is the mapping of peaks to corresponding amino acids, also known as the assignment problem. Structure-Based Assignment (SBA) is an approach to solve this problem using a template structure that is homologous to the target. Our previously developed approach Nuclear Vector Replacement-Binary Integer Programming (NVR-BIP) computed the optimal solution for small proteins, but was unable to solve the assignments of large proteins. NVR-Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) extended the applicability of the NVR approach for such proteins. One of the input data utilized in these approaches is the Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) data. NOE is an interaction observed between two protons if the protons are located close in space. These protons could be amide protons, protons attached to the alpha-carbon atom in the backbone of the protein, or side chain protons. NVR only uses backbone protons. In this paper, we reformulate the NVR-BIP model to distinguish the type of proton in NOE data and use the corresponding proton coordinates in the extended formulation. In addition, the threshold value over interproton distances is set in a standard manner for all proteins by extracting the NOE upper bound distance information from the data. We also convert NOE intensities into distance thresholds. Our new approach thus handles the NOE data correctly and without manually determined parameters. We accordingly adapt NVR-ACO solution methodology to these changes. Computational results show that our approaches obtain optimal solutions for small proteins. For the large proteins our ant colony optimization-based approach obtains promising results.

Reduced hamstring flexibility is common in adolescents (75% of boys and 35% of girls aged 10). The length of the hamstring muscle has an important role in both the effectiveness and the efficiency of basic human movements, and reduced hamstring flexibility is related to various musculoskeletal conditions. There are various approaches to measuring hamstring flexibility with high reliability; the most commonly used approaches in the scientific literature are the sit-and-reach test, hip joint angle (HJA), and active knee extension. The assessment of hamstring flexibility using video analysis could help with adolescent flexibility follow-up. Fifty-four adolescents from a local school participated in a descriptive study of repeated measures using a crossover design. Active knee extension and HJA were measured with an inclinometer and were simultaneously recorded with a video camera. Each video was downloaded to a computer and subsequently analyzed using Kinovea 0.8.15, a free software application for movement analysis. All outcome measures showed reliability estimates with α &gt; 0.90. The lowest reliability was obtained for HJA (α = 0.91). The preliminary findings support the use of a free software tool for assessing hamstring flexibility, offering health professionals a useful tool for adolescent flexibility follow-up.

10.1371/journal.pone.0144398  |  Diagnosis, Genetics  |  Diagnosis, Genetics  |  Gene ontology term enrichment analysis  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Review  |   Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder resulting from expansion of CAG repeats in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. Previous studies have shown mutant HTT can alter expression of genes associated with dysregulated epigenetic modifications. One of the most widely studied chromatin modifications is trimethylated lysine 4 of histone 3 (H3K4me3). Here, we conducted the first comprehensive study of H3K4me3 ChIP-sequencing in neuronal chromatin from the prefrontal cortex of six HD cases and six non-neurologic controls, and its association with gene expression measured by RNA-sequencing. We detected 2,830 differentially enriched H3K4me3 peaks between HD and controls, with 55% of them down-regulated in HD. Although H3K4me3 signals are expected to be associated with mRNA levels, we found an unexpected discordance between altered H3K4me3 peaks and mRNA levels. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis of the genes with differential H3K4me3 peaks, revealed statistically significantly enriched GO terms only in the genes with down-regulated signals in HD. The most frequently implicated biological process terms are organ morphogenesis and positive regulation of gene expression. More than 9,000 H3K4me3 peaks were located not near any recognized transcription start sites and approximately 36% of these "distal" peaks co-localized to known enhancer sites. Six transcription factors and chromatin remodelers are differentially enriched in HD H3K4me3 distal peaks, including EZH2 and SUZ12, two core subunits of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Moreover, PRC2 repressive state was significantly depleted in HD-enriched peaks, suggesting the epigenetic role of PRC2 inhibition associated with up-regulated H3K4me3 in Huntington's disease. In summary, our study provides new insights into transcriptional dysregulation of Huntington's disease by analyzing the differentiation of H3K4me3 enrichment.

10.1118/1.4915284  |  Treatment, Prognosis  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Treatment  |  bayesian network  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Purpose:  Prediction of radiation pneumonitis (RP) has been shown to be challenging due to the involvement of a variety of factors including dose-volume metrics and radiosensitivity biomarkers. Some of these factors are highly correlated and might affect prediction results when combined. Bayesian network (BN) provides a probabilistic framework to represent variable dependencies in a directed acyclic graph. The aim of this study is to integrate the BN framework and a systems' biology approach to detect possible interactions among RP risk factors and exploit these relationships to enhance both the understanding and prediction of RP. 
  Methods:  The authors studied 54 nonsmall-cell lung cancer patients who received curative 3D-conformal radiotherapy. Nineteen RP events were observed (common toxicity criteria for adverse events grade 2 or higher). Serum concentration of the following four candidate biomarkers were measured at baseline and midtreatment: alpha-2-macroglobulin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), transforming growth factor, interleukin-6. Dose-volumetric and clinical parameters were also included as covariates. Feature selection was performed using a Markov blanket approach based on the Koller-Sahami filter. The Markov chain Monte Carlo technique estimated the posterior distribution of BN graphs built from the observed data of the selected variables and causality constraints. RP probability was estimated using a limited number of high posterior graphs (ensemble) and was averaged for the final RP estimate using Bayes' rule. A resampling method based on bootstrapping was applied to model training and validation in order to control under- and overfit pitfalls. 
  Results:  RP prediction power of the BN ensemble approach reached its optimum at a size of 200. The optimized performance of the BN model recorded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.83, which was significantly higher than multivariate logistic regression (0.77), mean heart dose (0.69), and a pre-to-midtreatment change in ACE (0.66). When RP prediction was made only with pretreatment information, the AUC ranged from 0.76 to 0.81 depending on the ensemble size. Bootstrap validation of graph features in the ensemble quantified confidence of association between variables in the graphs where ten interactions were statistically significant. 
  Conclusions:  The presented BN methodology provides the flexibility to model hierarchical interactions between RP covariates, which is applied to probabilistic inference on RP. The authors' preliminary results demonstrate that such framework combined with an ensemble method can possibly improve prediction of RP under real-life clinical circumstances such as missing data or treatment plan adaptation.

BrainPrint captures shape information of an ensemble of cortical and subcortical structures by solving the eigenvalue problem of the 2D and 3D Laplace-Beltrami operator on triangular (boundary) and tetrahedral (volumetric) meshes. This discriminative characterization enables new ways to study the similarity between brains; the focus can either be on a specific brain structure of interest or on the overall brain similarity. We highlight four applications for BrainPrint in this article: (i) subject identification, (ii) age and sex prediction, (iii) brain asymmetry analysis, and (iv) potential genetic influences on brain morphology. The properties of BrainPrint require the derivation of new algorithms to account for the heterogeneous mix of brain structures with varying discriminative power. We conduct experiments on three datasets, including over 3000 MRI scans from the ADNI database, 436 MRI scans from the OASIS dataset, and 236 MRI scans from the VETSA twin study. All processing steps for obtaining the compact representation are fully automated, making this processing framework particularly attractive for handling large datasets.

There were 5001 up- or down-regulated genes in 2-fold differentially expressed genes, 956 up- or down-regulated genes in 5-fold differentially expressed genes, and 114 up- or down-regulated genes in 20-fold differentially expressed genes. Therefore, significant differences were observed in the gene expression in pathological scar tissues and normal foreskin tissues. The development of pathological scar tissues has been correlated to changes in multiple genes and pathways, which are believed to form a dynamic network connection.

  Materials and methods:  A total of 696 patients with lung cancer were enrolled. The factors were compared employing Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney test or the Chi-square test and variables that were significantly related to the presence of deep fungal infection selected as candidates for input into the final artificial neural network analysis (ANN) model. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the performance of the artificial neural network (ANN) model and logistic regression (LR) model. 
  Results:  The prevalence of deep fungal infection from lung cancer in this entire study population was 32.04%(223/696), deep fungal infections occur in sputum specimens 44.05% (200/454). The ratio of candida albicans was 86.99% (194/223) in the total fungi. It was demonstrated that older (≥65 years), use of antibiotics, low serum albumin concentrations (≤37.18 g /L), radiotherapy, surgery, low hemoglobin hyperlipidemia (≤93.67 g /L), long time of hospitalization (≥14 days) were apt to deep fungal infection and the ANN model consisted of the seven factors. The AUC of ANN model (0.829±0.019) was higher than that of LR model (0.756±0.021). 
  Conclusions:  The artificial neural network model with variables consisting of age, use of antibiotics, serum albumin concentrations, received radiotherapy, received surgery, hemoglobin, time of hospitalization should be useful for predicting the deep fungal infection in lung cancer.

10.1371/journal.pone.0123236  |  Genetics  |  Treatment, Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   14-3-3 proteins are a large multigenic family of regulatory proteins ubiquitously found in eukaryotes. In plants, 14-3-3 proteins are reported to play significant role in both development and response to stress stimuli. Therefore, considering their importance, genome-wide analyses have been performed in many plants including Arabidopsis, rice and soybean. But, till date, no comprehensive investigation has been conducted in any C4 panicoid crops. In view of this, the present study was performed to identify 8, 5 and 26 potential 14-3-3 gene family members in foxtail millet (Si14-3-3), sorghum (Sb14-3-3) and maize (Zm14-3-3), respectively. In silico characterization revealed large variations in their gene structures; segmental and tandem duplications have played a major role in expansion of these genes in foxtail millet and maize. Gene ontology annotation showed the participation of 14-3-3 proteins in diverse biological processes and molecular functions, and in silico expression profiling indicated their higher expression in all the investigated tissues. Comparative mapping was performed to derive the orthologous relationships between 14-3-3 genes of foxtail millet and other Poaceae members, which showed a higher, as well as similar percentage of orthology among these crops. Expression profiling of Si14-3-3 genes during different time-points of abiotic stress and hormonal treatments showed a differential expression pattern of these genes, and sub-cellular localization studies revealed the site of action of Si14-3-3 proteins within the cells. Further downstream characterization indicated the interaction of Si14-3-3 with a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling phosphoprotein (SiRSZ21A) in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, and this demonstrates that Si14-3-3 might regulate the splicing events by binding with phosphorylated SiRSZ21A. Taken together, the present study is a comprehensive analysis of 14-3-3 gene family members in foxtail millet, sorghum and maize, which provides interesting information on their gene structure, protein domains, phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships, and expression patterns during abiotic stresses and hormonal treatments, which could be useful in choosing candidate members for further functional characterization. In addition, demonstration of interaction between Si14-3-3 and SiRSZ21A provides novel clues on the involvement of 14-3-3 proteins in the splicing events.

10.3390/ijms16059693  |  Genetics  |  Genetics  |  microarray analysis  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Review  |   Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) enhances cellular proliferation and reduces apoptosis during the early differentiation of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) into neural progenitor-like cells (NPCs) in the presence of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). BMSCs were differentiated in three groups of growth factors: (A) EGF + bFGF, (B) EGF + bFGF + IGF-1, and (C) without growth factor. To unravel the molecular mechanisms of the NPCs derivation, microarray analysis using GeneChip miRNA arrays was performed. The profiles were compared among the groups. Annotated microRNA fingerprints (GSE60060) delineated 46 microRNAs temporally up-regulated or down-regulated compared to group C. The expressions of selected microRNAs were validated by real-time PCR. Among the 46 microRNAs, 30 were consistently expressed for minimum of two consecutive time intervals. In Group B, only miR-496 was up-regulated and 12 microRNAs, including the let-7 family, miR-1224, miR-125a-3p, miR-214, miR-22, miR-320, miR-708, and miR-93, were down-regulated. Bioinformatics analysis reveals that some of these microRNAs (miR-22, miR-214, miR-125a-3p, miR-320 and let-7 family) are associated with reduction of apoptosis. Here, we summarize the roles of key microRNAs associated with IGF-1 in the differentiation of BMSCs into NPCs. These findings may provide clues to further our understanding of the mechanisms and roles of microRNAs as key regulators of BMSC-derived NPC maintenance.

We conducted simultaneous microscopic and transcriptomic analyses of the pathogen and the host to investigate the infection process developed by B. cinerea on MB versus VB, and the plant defense mechanisms deployed to stop the fungus spreading. On the pathogen side, our genome-wide transcriptomic data revealed that B. cinerea genes upregulated during infection of MB are enriched in functional categories related to necrotrophy, such as degradation of the plant cell wall, proteolysis, membrane transport, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and detoxification. Quantitative-polymerase chain reaction on a set of representative genes related to virulence and microscopic observations further demonstrated that the infection is also initiated on VB but is stopped at the penetration stage. On the plant side, genome-wide transcriptomic analysis and metabolic data revealed a defense pathway switch during berry ripening. In response to B. cinerea inoculation, VB activated a burst of ROS, the salicylate-dependent defense pathway, the synthesis of the resveratrol phytoalexin, and cell-wall strengthening. On the contrary, in infected MB, the jasmonate-dependent pathway was activated, which did not stop the fungal necrotrophic process.

10.1128/EC.00117-15  |  Genetics  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Inositolphosphorylceramide (IPC) and its mannosylated derivatives are the only complex sphingolipids of yeast. Their synthesis can be reduced by aureobasidin A (AbA), which specifically inhibits the IPC synthase Aur1. AbA reportedly, by diminishing IPC levels, causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, an increase in cytosolic calcium, reactive oxygen production, and mitochondrial damage leading to apoptosis. We found that when Aur1 is gradually depleted by transcriptional downregulation, the accumulation of ceramides becomes a major hindrance to cell survival. Overexpression of the alkaline ceramidase YPC1 rescues cells under this condition. We established hydroxylated C26 fatty acids as a reliable hallmark of ceramide hydrolysis. Such hydrolysis occurs only when YPC1 is overexpressed. In contrast, overexpression of YPC1 has no beneficial effect when Aur1 is acutely repressed by AbA. A high-throughput genetic screen revealed that vesicle-mediated transport between Golgi apparatus, endosomes, and vacuole becomes crucial for survival when Aur1 is repressed, irrespective of the mode of repression. In addition, vacuolar acidification becomes essential when cells are acutely stressed by AbA, and quinacrine uptake into vacuoles shows that AbA activates vacuolar acidification. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine does not improve cell growth on AbA, indicating that reactive oxygen radicals induced by AbA play a minor role in its toxicity. AbA strongly induces the cell wall integrity pathway, but osmotic support does not improve the viability of wild-type cells on AbA. Altogether, the data support and refine current models of AbA-mediated cell death and add vacuolar protein transport and acidification as novel critical elements of stress resistance.

Here, we aimed to explore the innate immune system and detoxification mechanism of the deep sea mussel Bathymodiolus platifrons collected from a methane seep in the South China Sea. We sequenced the transcriptome of the mussels' gill, foot and mantle tissues and generated a transcriptomic database containing 96,683 transcript sequences. Based on GO and KEGG annotations, we reported transcripts that were related to the innate immune system, heavy metal detoxification and sulfide metabolic genes. Our in-depth analysis on the isoforms of peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) that have different cellular location and potentially differential selectivity towards peptidoglycan (PGN) from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were differentially expressed in different tissues. We also reported a potentially novel form of metallothionein and the production of phytochelatin in B. platifrons, which has not been reported in any of its coastal relative Mytilus mussel species. Overall, the present study provided new insights into heavy metal and sulfide metabolism in B. platifrons and can be served as the basis for future molecular studies on host-symbiont interactions in cold seep mussels.

10.1097/MD.0000000000001228  |  Treatment  |  Prognosis  |  statistical analysis  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   This study sought to evaluate the predictive value of the DAP (diameter-axial-polar) nephrometry system on surgical outcomes following partial nephrectomy (PN).This was a retrospective study of 237 patients who underwent open or minimally invasive PN for renal tumors at a single tertiary care center between 2009 and 2013. The primary outcomes included ischemia time &gt;20 minutes and percentage of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline &gt;10%. Statistical analysis was performed to study associations and predictions.The DAP sum score exhibited a statistically significant correlation with ischemia time, operative time (OT), estimated blood loss (EBL), length of hospital stay (LOS), and percent change in eGFR. The DAP sum score (odds ratio [OR]: 1.749; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.379-2.220; P &lt; 0.001) and conventional laparoscopy and laparo-endoscopic single-site (CL&amp;LESS) surgery versus the open surgical approach (OR: 5.736; 95% CI: 2.529-13.011; P &lt; 0.001) independently predicted an ischemia time &gt;20 minutes. Similarly, the DAP sum score (OR: 1.297; 95% CI 1.051-1.602; P = 0.016), age-weighted Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) (OR: 4.730; 95% CI 1.463-15.291; P = 0.009), EBL (OR 2.433; 95% CI 1.095-5.407; P = 0.029), and ischemia time (OR 3.332; 95% CI 1.777-6.249; P &lt; 0.001) were identified as independent predictors of eGFR decline &gt;10%. Furthermore, the DAP score × ischemia time interactions were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001).We confirmed the predictive value of the DAP nephrometry score with respect to ischemia time and renal functional decline in an independent external cohort of patients undergoing PN. The effect of the DAP score on renal functional decline partially depends on that of ischemia time, and the individual component DAP scores may have different effects on clinical outcomes.

10.1007/s13304-015-0304-5  |  Treatment, Robotics, Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis, Robotics  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Laparoscopic resection of liver tumors located in the posterosuperior segments is a challenging operation that could be facilitated by robotic assistance. Laparoscopic resection of 12 tumors located in posterosuperior segments (IVa: 1; VII: 5; VIII: 6) was carried out under robotic assistance. All patients had a single tumor nodule. Data were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively. Surgery required a mean of 260.4 min (115-430) and was completed laparoscopically in all but one patient, who required conversion to mini-laparotomy because of intolerance of pneumoperitoneum (8.3%). Mean estimated blood loss was 252.7 ml (50-600), making transfusion necessary in 3 patients (25.0%). Post-operative complications occurred in 4 patients (33.3%), being of Clavien-Dindo grade II in 3 patients (25.0%) and Clavien-Dindo grade IV in 1 patient (8.3%). Reoperation was required in 1 patient, who subsequently had a long hospital stay, because of decompensated cirrhosis. Median length of hospital stay was 8.5 days (7-96). No patient was readmitted. Pathology showed hepatocellular carcinoma in 7 patients (58.3%), liver metastasis in 2 patients (16.6%), and hepatic adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, and hemangioma in one patient each (8.3%). All patients had a margin negative resection. After a mean follow-up period of 21.4 months (±24.4), no patient with malignant histology developed recurrence. Our initial experience confirms that laparoscopic robot-assisted resection of tumors located in the posterosuperior segments is feasible. Further experience is needed before final conclusions can be drawn and meaningful comparison with other surgical techniques becomes possible.

10.1074/mcp.M115.052894  |  Treatment, Drug Discovery  |  Diagnosis, Treatment  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   The coordinated and synchronized cardiac muscle contraction relies on an efficient gap junction-mediated intercellular communication (GJIC) between cardiomyocytes, which involves the rapid anisotropic impulse propagation through connexin (Cx)-containing channels, namely of Cx43, the most abundant Cx in the heart. Expectedly, disturbing mechanisms that affect channel activity, localization and turnover of Cx43 have been implicated in several cardiomyopathies, such as myocardial ischemia. Besides gap junction-mediated intercellular communication, Cx43 has been associated with channel-independent functions, including modulation of cell adhesion, differentiation, proliferation and gene transcription. It has been suggested that the role played by Cx43 is dictated by the nature of the proteins that interact with Cx43. Therefore, the characterization of the Cx43-interacting network and its dynamics is vital to understand not only the molecular mechanisms underlying pathological malfunction of gap junction-mediated intercellular communication, but also to unveil novel and unanticipated biological functions of Cx43. In the present report, we applied a quantitative SWATH-MS approach to characterize the Cx43 interactome in rat hearts subjected to ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion. Our results demonstrate that, in the heart, Cx43 interacts with proteins related with various biological processes such as metabolism, signaling and trafficking. The interaction of Cx43 with proteins involved in gene transcription strengthens the emerging concept that Cx43 has a role in gene expression regulation. Importantly, our data shows that the interactome of Cx43 (Connexome) is differentially modulated in diseased hearts. Overall, the characterization of Cx43-interacting network may contribute to the establishment of new therapeutic targets to modulate cardiac function in physiological and pathological conditions. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD002331.

  Methods:  A retrospective series of cervical cancer patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stages IB2-IIB treated with NACT followed by radical surgery was analyzed. Clinical predictors of persistence of intermediate- and/or high-risk factors at final pathological analysis were investigated. Statistical analysis was performed using univariate and multivariate analysis and using a model based on artificial intelligence known as artificial neuronal network (ANN) analysis. 
  Results:  Overall, 101 patients were available for the analyses. Fifty-two (51 %) patients were considered at high risk secondary to parametrial, resection margin and/or lymph node involvement. When disease was confined to the cervix, four (4 %) patients were considered at intermediate risk. At univariate analysis, FIGO grade 3, stage IIB disease at diagnosis and the presence of enlarged nodes before NACT predicted the presence of intermediate- and/or high-risk factors at final pathological analysis. At multivariate analysis, only FIGO grade 3 and tumor diameter maintained statistical significance. The specificity of ANN models in evaluating predictive variables was slightly superior to conventional multivariable models. 
  Conclusions:  FIGO grade, stage, tumor diameter, and histology are associated with persistence of pathological intermediate- and/or high-risk factors after NACT and radical surgery. This information is useful in counseling patients at the time of treatment planning with regard to the probability of being subjected to pelvic radiotherapy after completion of the initially planned treatment.

The efficiency of a problem solver depends on the speed of its individual decisions and the number of decisions it can explore in parallel. It remains unknown whether the primate brain can consider multiple decisions at the same time. We therefore trained monkeys to navigate through a decision tree with stochastic sensory evidence at multiple branching points and recorded neuronal activity in visual cortical areas V1 and V4. We found a first phase of decision making in which neuronal activity increased in parallel along multiple branches of the decision tree. This was followed by an integration phase where the optimal overall strategy crystallized as the result of interactions between local decisions. The results reveal how sensory evidence is integrated efficiently for hierarchical decisions and contribute to our understanding of the brain mechanisms that implement complex mental programs.

Understanding their function in the context of sensory processing and representation is a major current challenge. Here we report that intrinsic cortical dynamics strongly affect the representational geometry of a brain region, as reflected in response-pattern dissimilarities, and exaggerate the similarity of representations between brain regions. We characterized the representations in several human visual areas by representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) constructed from fMRI response-patterns for natural image stimuli. The RDMs of different visual areas were highly similar when the response-patterns were estimated on the basis of the same trials (sharing intrinsic cortical dynamics), and quite distinct when patterns were estimated on the basis of separate trials (sharing only the stimulus-driven component). We show that the greater similarity of the representational geometries can be explained by coherent fluctuations of regional-mean activation within visual cortex, reflecting intrinsic dynamics. Using separate trials to study stimulus-driven representations revealed clearer distinctions between the representational geometries: a Gabor wavelet pyramid model explained representational geometry in visual areas V1-3 and a categorical animate-inanimate model in the object-responsive lateral occipital cortex.

PMID:26862343  |  Prognosis  |  Prognosis  |  support vector machines, gravitational search algorithm  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  The aim of this study is to present an objective method based on support vector machines (SVMs) and gravitational search algorithm (GSA) which is initially utilized for recognition the pattern among risk factors and hypertension (HTN) to stratify and analysis HTN's risk factors in an Iranian urban population. 
  Methods:  This community-based and cross-sectional research has been designed based on the probabilistic sample of residents of Isfahan, Iran, aged 19 years or over from 2001 to 2007. One of the household members was randomly selected from different age groups. Selected individuals were invited to a predefined health center to be educated on how to collect 24-hour urine sample as well as learning about topographic parameters and blood pressure measurement. The data from both the estimated and measured blood pressure [for both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)] demonstrated that optimized SVMs have a highest estimation potential. 
  Results:  This result was particularly more evident when SVMs performance is evaluated with regression and generalized linear modeling (GLM) as common methods. Blood pressure risk factors impact analysis shows that age has the highest impact level on SBP while it falls second on the impact level ranking on DBP. The results also showed that body mass index (BMI) falls first on the impact level ranking on DBP while have a lower impact on SBP. 
  Conclusion:  Our analysis suggests that salt intake could efficiently influence both DBP and SBP with greater impact level on SBP. Therefore, controlling salt intake may lead to not only control of HTN but also its prevention.

However, ubiquitous testing procedures have yet to be implemented in these areas, necessitating a simple, rapid, and accurate testing platform to diagnose sickle cell disease. Here, we present a label-free, sensitive, and specific testing platform using only a small blood sample (&lt;1 μl) based on the higher density of sickle red blood cells under deoxygenated conditions. Testing is performed with a lightweight and compact 3D-printed attachment installed on a commercial smartphone. This attachment includes an LED to illuminate the sample, an optical lens to magnify the image, and two permanent magnets for magnetic levitation of red blood cells. The sample is suspended in a paramagnetic medium with sodium metabisulfite and loaded in a microcapillary tube that is inserted between the magnets. Red blood cells are levitated in the magnetic field based on equilibrium between the magnetic and buoyancy forces acting on the cells. Using this approach, we were able to distinguish between the levitation patterns of sickle versus control red blood cells based on their degree of confinement.

Genome-wide chromatin-states area rich source of information about cellular state, yielding insights beyond what is typically obtained by transcriptome profiling. We propose an integrative method for genome-wide functional predictions of lncRNAs by combining chromatin states data with gene expression patterns. We first validated the method using protein-coding genes with known function annotations. Our validation results indicated that our integrative method performs better than co-expression analysis, and is accurate across different conditions. Next, by applying the integrative model genome-wide, we predicted the probable functions for more than 97% of human lncRNAs. The putative functions inferred by our method match with previously annotated by the targets of lncRNAs. Moreover, the linkage from the cellular processes influenced by cancer-associated lncRNAs to the cancer hallmarks provided a "lncRNA point-of-view" on tumor biology. Our approach provides a functional annotation of the lncRNAs, which we developed into a web-based application, LncRNA Ontology, to provide visualization, analysis, and downloading of lncRNA putative functions.

For example, the ChIP-exo protocol precisely characterizes protein-DNA cross-linking patterns by combining chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with 5' → 3' exonuclease digestion. Similarly, deeply sequenced chromatin accessibility assays (e.g. DNase-seq and ATAC-seq) enable the detection of protected footprints at protein-DNA binding sites. With these techniques and others, we have the potential to characterize the individual nucleotides that interact with transcription factors, nucleosomes, RNA polymerases and other regulatory proteins in a particular cellular context. In this review, we explain the experimental assays and computational analysis methods that enable high-resolution profiling of protein-DNA binding events. We discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with such approaches.

Inconsistencies may arise from averaging heterogeneous groups of patients. Here we investigate whether SZ is a heterogeneous group of disorders distinguished by distinct patterns of FA reductions. We developed a Generalized Factorization Method (GFM) to identify biclusters (i.e., subsets of subjects associated with a subset of particular characteristics, such as low FA in specific regions). GFM appropriately assembles a collection of unsupervised techniques with Non-negative Matrix Factorization to generate biclusters, rather than averaging across all subjects and all their characteristics. DTI tract-based spatial statistics images, which output is the locally maximal FA projected onto the group white matter skeleton, were analyzed in 47 SZ and 36 healthy subjects, identifying 8 biclusters. The mean FA of the voxels of each bicluster was significantly different from those of other SZ subjects or 36 healthy controls. The eight biclusters were organized into four more general patterns of low FA in specific regions: 1) genu of corpus callosum (GCC), 2) fornix (FX)+external capsule (EC), 3) splenium of CC (SCC)+retrolenticular limb (RLIC)+posterior limb (PLIC) of the internal capsule, and 4) anterior limb of the internal capsule. These patterns were significantly associated with particular clinical features: Pattern 1 (GCC) with bizarre behavior, pattern 2 (FX+EC) with prominent delusions, and pattern 3 (SCC+RLIC+PLIC) with negative symptoms including disorganized speech. The uncovered patterns suggest that SZ is a heterogeneous group of disorders that can be distinguished by different patterns of FA reductions associated with distinct clinical features.

10.2196/mhealth.4160  |  Smart Healthcare, Treatment  |  Treatment, Smart Healthcare  |  multi-armed bandit  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  A dramatic rise in health-tracking apps for mobile phones has occurred recently. Rich user interfaces make manual logging of users' behaviors easier and more pleasant, and sensors make tracking effortless. To date, however, feedback technologies have been limited to providing overall statistics, attractive visualization of tracked data, or simple tailoring based on age, gender, and overall calorie or activity information. There are a lack of systems that can perform automated translation of behavioral data into specific actionable suggestions that promote healthier lifestyle without any human involvement. 
  Objective:  MyBehavior, a mobile phone app, was designed to process tracked physical activity and eating behavior data in order to provide personalized, actionable, low-effort suggestions that are contextualized to the user's environment and previous behavior. This study investigated the technical feasibility of implementing an automated feedback system, the impact of the suggestions on user physical activity and eating behavior, and user perceptions of the automatically generated suggestions. 
  Methods:  MyBehavior was designed to (1) use a combination of automatic and manual logging to track physical activity (eg, walking, running, gym), user location, and food, (2) automatically analyze activity and food logs to identify frequent and nonfrequent behaviors, and (3) use a standard machine-learning, decision-making algorithm, called multi-armed bandit (MAB), to generate personalized suggestions that ask users to either continue, avoid, or make small changes to existing behaviors to help users reach behavioral goals. We enrolled 17 participants, all motivated to self-monitor and improve their fitness, in a pilot study of MyBehavior. In a randomized two-group trial, investigators randomly assigned participants to receive either MyBehavior's personalized suggestions (n=9) or nonpersonalized suggestions (n=8), created by professionals, from a mobile phone app over 3 weeks. Daily activity level and dietary intake was monitored from logged data. At the end of the study, an in-person survey was conducted that asked users to subjectively rate their intention to follow MyBehavior suggestions. 
  Results:  In qualitative daily diary, interview, and survey data, users reported MyBehavior suggestions to be highly actionable and stated that they intended to follow the suggestions. MyBehavior users walked significantly more than the control group over the 3 weeks of the study (P=.05). Although some MyBehavior users chose lower-calorie foods, the between-group difference was not significant (P=.15). In a poststudy survey, users rated MyBehavior's personalized suggestions more positively than the nonpersonalized, generic suggestions created by professionals (P&lt;.001). 
  Conclusions:  MyBehavior is a simple-to-use mobile phone app with preliminary evidence of efficacy. To the best of our knowledge, MyBehavior represents the first attempt to create personalized, contextualized, actionable suggestions automatically from self-tracked information (ie, manual food logging and automatic tracking of activity). Lessons learned about the difficulty of manual logging and usability concerns, as well as future directions, are discussed.

Strong evidence also suggests its role in metastasis. It is proved experimentally that PAR1 can induce numerous cell phenotypes, i.e. proliferation and differentiation. A strong link between PAR1 gene overexpression and high levels of ß-catenin was suggested by a study of the PAR1-Gα(13)-DVL axis in ß-catenin stabilization in cancers. An in vitro study was carried out to analyze PAR1 expression by flow cytometry on CD38+138+ plasma cells obtained from patients either at diagnosis (n: 46) (newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM)) or at relapse (n: 45) (relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM)) and compared with the controls. Our previously synthesized benzoxazole (XT2B) and benzamide (XT5) derivatives were tested with in vitro 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays, which revealed significant inhibitory activity on PAR1. We provide docking studies using Autodock Vina of these newly tested compounds to compare with the known PAR1 inhibitors in order to examine the binding mechanisms. In addition, the docking results are validated using HYDE binding assessment and a neural network (NN) scoring function.

10.1111/jipb.12328  |  Genetics  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   In this report, we compared transcriptomic differences between a synthetic Populus section Tacamahaca triploid driven by second-division restitution and its parents using a high-throughput RNA-seq method. A total of 4,080 genes were differentially expressed between the high-growth vigor allotriploids (SDR-H) and their parents, and 719 genes were non-additively expressed in SDR-H. Differences in gene expression between the allotriploid and male parent were more significant than those between the allotriploid and female parent, which may be caused by maternal effects. We observed 3,559 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the SDR-H and male parent. Notably, the genes were mainly involved in metabolic process, cell proliferation, DNA methylation, cell division, and meristem and developmental growth. Among the 1,056 DEGs between SDR-H and female parent, many genes were associated with metabolic process and carbon utilization. In addition, 1,789 DEGs between high- and low-growth vigor allotriploid were mainly associated with metabolic process, auxin poplar transport, and regulation of meristem growth. Our results indicated that the higher poplar ploidy level can generate extensive transcriptomic diversity compared with its parents. Overall, these results increased our understanding of the driving force for phenotypic variation and adaptation in allopolyploids driven by second-division restitution.

Mature seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana are desiccation tolerant, but they lose desiccation tolerance (DT) while progressing to germination. Yet, there is a small developmental window during which DT can be rescued by treatment with abscisic acid (ABA). To gain temporal resolution and identify relevant genes in this process, data from a time series of microarrays were used to build a gene co-expression network. The network has two regions, namely early response (ER) and late response (LR). Genes in the ER region are related to biological processes, such as dormancy, acquisition of DT and drought, amplification of signals, growth arrest and induction of protection mechanisms (such as LEA proteins). Genes in the LR region lead to inhibition of photosynthesis and primary metabolism, promote adaptation to stress conditions and contribute to seed longevity. Phenotyping of 12 hubs in relation to re-establishment of DT with T-DNA insertion lines indicated a significant increase in the ability to re-establish DT compared with the wild-type in the lines cbsx4, at3g53040 and at4g25580, suggesting the operation of redundant and compensatory mechanisms. Moreover, we show that re-establishment of DT by polyethylene glycol and ABA occurs through partially overlapping mechanisms. Our data confirm that co-expression network analysis is a valid approach to examine data from time series of transcriptome analysis, as it provides promising insights into biologically relevant relations that help to generate new information about the roles of certain genes for DT.

10.1104/pp.114.253120  |  Genetics  |  Drug Discovery, Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   AvrE family type III effector proteins share the ability to suppress host defenses, induce disease-associated cell death, and promote bacterial growth. However, despite widespread contributions to numerous bacterial diseases in agriculturally important plants, the mode of action of these effectors remains largely unknown. WtsE is an AvrE family member required for the ability of Pantoea stewartii ssp. stewartii (Pnss) to proliferate efficiently and cause wilt and leaf blight symptoms in maize (Zea mays) plants. Notably, when WtsE is delivered by a heterologous system into the leaf cells of susceptible maize seedlings, it alone produces water-soaked disease symptoms reminiscent of those produced by Pnss. Thus, WtsE is a pathogenicity and virulence factor in maize, and an Escherichia coli heterologous delivery system can be used to study the activity of WtsE in isolation from other factors produced by Pnss. Transcriptional profiling of maize revealed the effects of WtsE, including induction of genes involved in secondary metabolism and suppression of genes involved in photosynthesis. Targeted metabolite quantification revealed that WtsE perturbs maize metabolism, including the induction of coumaroyl tyramine. The ability of mutant WtsE derivatives to elicit transcriptional and metabolic changes in susceptible maize seedlings correlated with their ability to promote disease. Furthermore, chemical inhibitors that block metabolic flux into the phenylpropanoid pathways targeted by WtsE also disrupted the pathogenicity and virulence activity of WtsE. While numerous metabolites produced downstream of the shikimate pathway are known to promote plant defense, our results indicate that misregulated induction of phenylpropanoid metabolism also can be used to promote pathogen virulence.

Complex febrile seizures are associated with an increased risk to develop temporal lobe epilepsy. To investigate short- and long-term effects of experimental febrile seizures (eFS), we induced eFS in highly febrile convulsion-susceptible C57BL/6J mice at post-natal day 10 by exposure to hyperthermia (HT) and compared them to normotherm-exposed (NT) mice. We detected structural re-organization in the hippocampus 14 days after eFS. To identify molecular candidates, which entrain this structural re-organization, we investigated temporal changes in mRNA expression profiles eFS 1 hour to 56 days after eFS. We identified 931 regulated genes and profiled several candidates using in situ hybridization and histology at 3 and 14 days after eFS. This is the first study to report genome-wide transcriptome analysis after eFS in mice. We identify temporal regulation of multiple processes, such as stress-, immune- and inflammatory responses, glia activation, glutamate-glutamine cycle and myelination. Identification of the short- and long-term changes after eFS is important to elucidate the mechanisms contributing to epileptogenesis.

The phosphorylation events that regulate circadian-dependent signaling and the processes which post-translationally respond to clock-gated signals are largely unknown. To better elucidate post-translational events tied to the circadian system we carried out a survey of circadian-regulated protein phosphorylation events in Arabidopsis seedlings. A large-scale mass spectrometry-based quantitative phosphoproteomics approach employing TiO2-based phosphopeptide enrichment techniques identified and quantified 1586 phosphopeptides on 1080 protein groups. A total of 102 phosphopeptides displayed significant changes in abundance, enabling the identification of specific patterns of response to circadian rhythms. Our approach was sensitive enough to quantitate oscillations in the phosphorylation of low abundance clock proteins (early flowering4; ELF4 and pseudoresponse regulator3; PRR3) as well as other transcription factors and kinases. During constant light, extensive cyclic changes in phosphorylation status occurred in critical regulators, implicating direct or indirect regulation by the circadian system. These included proteins influencing transcriptional regulation, translation, metabolism, stress and phytohormones-mediated responses. We validated our analysis using the elf4-211 allele, in which an S45L transition removes the phosphorylation herein identified. We show that removal of this phosphorylatable site diminishes interaction with early flowering3 (ELF3), a key partner in a tripartite evening complex required for circadian cycling. elf4-211 lengthens period, which increases with increasing temperature, relative to the wild type, resulting in a more stable temperature compensation of circadian period over a wider temperature range.

Spinors generated by the average-of-configuration Hartree-Fock method with the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian were used in CI calculations by the KRCI (Kramers-restricted configuration interaction) program. The CI reference space was generated by distributing 11 electrons among the 11 Kramers pairs composed mainly of Dy [4f], [6s], [6p] atomic spinors, and double excitations are allowed from this space to the virtual molecular spinors. The CI calculations indicate that the ground state has the dominant configuration (4f(9))(6s(2))(Ω = 7.5). Above this ground state, 4 low-lying excited states (Ω = 8.5, 7.5, 7.5, 7.5) are found with dominant configurations (4f(10))(6s). These results are consistent with the experimental studies of McCarthy et al. Above these 5 states, 2 states were observed at T0 = 2.39 eV, 2.52 eV by McCarthy et al. and were named as [19.3]8.5 and [20.3]8.5. McCarthy et al. proposed that both states have dominant configurations (4f(9))(6s)(6p), but these configurations are not consistent with the large Re's (∼3.9 a.u.) estimated from the observed rotational constants. The present CI calculations provide near-degenerate states of (4f(10))(6p3/2,1/2), (4f(10))(6p3/2,3/2), and (4f(9))(6s)(6p3/2,1/2) at around 3 eV. The former two states have larger Re (3.88 a.u.) than the third, so that it is reasonable to assign (4f(10))(6p3/2,1/2) to [19.3]8.5 and (4f(10))(6p3/2,3/2) to [20.3]8.5.

In angiosperms, this adjustment involves the differential regulation of vascular cambial activity between the lower (opposite wood) and upper (tension wood) sides of the leaning stem. We investigated the molecular mechanisms leading to the formation of differential wood types through a quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis on poplar subjected to a gravitropic stimulus. We identified and quantified 675 phosphopeptides, corresponding to 468 phosphoproteins, and 3 763 nonphosphorylated peptides, corresponding to 1 155 proteins, in the differentiating xylem of straight-growing trees (control) and trees subjected to a gravitational stimulus during 8 weeks. About 1% of the peptides were specific to a wood type (straight, opposite, or tension wood). Proteins quantified in more than one type of wood were more numerous: a mixed linear model showed 389 phosphopeptides and 556 proteins to differ in abundance between tension wood and opposite wood. Twenty-one percent of the phosphoproteins identified here were described in their phosphorylated form for the first time. Our analyses revealed remarkable developmental molecular plasticity, with wood type-specific phosphorylation events, and highlighted the involvement of different proteins in the biosynthesis of cell wall components during the formation of the three types of wood.

Using genome-wide SAGE-Seq, we provide a global assessment of differentially expressed genes altered with age and environmental enrichment in the hippocampus. Qualitative and quantitative proteomics in naïve young and aged mice was used to further identify phosphorylated proteins differentially expressed with age. We found that increased expression of endogenous protein phosphatase-1 inhibitors in aged mice may be characteristic of long-term environmental enrichment and improved cognitive status. As such, hippocampus-dependent performances in spatial, recognition, and associative memories, which are sensitive to aging, were preserved by environmental enrichment and accompanied by decreased protein phosphatase activity. Age-associated phosphorylated proteins were also found to correspond to the functional categories of age-associated genes identified through transcriptome analysis. Together, this study provides a comprehensive map of the transcriptome and proteome in the aging brain, and elucidates endogenous protein phosphatase-1 inhibition as a potential means through which environmental enrichment may ameliorate age-related cognitive deficits.

Owing to an intrinsic band gap of 1.2-1.9 eV, monolayer or a-few-layer MoS2 is used for fabricating field effect transistors (FETs) with high electron mobility and on/off ratio. However, the traditional FETs are controlled by an externally supplied gate voltage, which may not be sensitive enough to directly interface with a mechanical stimulus for applications in electronic skin. Here we report a type of top-pressure/force-gated field effect transistors (PGFETs) based on a hybrid structure of a 2D MoS2 flake and 1D ZnO nanowire (NW) array. Once an external pressure is applied, the piezoelectric polarization charges created at the tips of ZnO NWs grown on MoS2 act as a gate voltage to tune/control the source-drain transport property in MoS2. At a 6.25 MPa applied stimulus on a packaged device, the source-drain current can be tuned for ∼25%, equivalent to the results of applying an extra -5 V back gate voltage. Another type of PGFET with a dielectric layer (Al2O3) sandwiched between MoS2 and ZnO also shows consistent results. A theoretical model is proposed to interpret the received data. This study sets the foundation for applying the 2D material-based FETs in the field of artificial intelligence.

However, GGT's predictive utility applies well beyond liver disease: elevated GGT is linked to increased risk to a multitude of diseases and conditions, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, metabolic syndrome (MetS), and all-cause mortality. The literature from multiple population groups worldwide consistently shows strong predictive power for GGT, even across different gender and ethnic categories. Here, we examine the relationship of GGT to other serum markers such as serum ferritin (SF) levels, and we suggest a link to exposure to environmental and endogenous toxins, resulting in oxidative and nitrosative stress. We observe a general upward trend in population levels of GGT over time, particularly in the US and Korea. Since the late 1970s, both GGT and incident MetS and its related disorders have risen in virtual lockstep. GGT is an early predictive marker for atherosclerosis, heart failure, arterial stiffness and plaque, gestational diabetes, and various liver diseases, including viral hepatitis, other infectious diseases, and several life-threatening cancers. We review literature both from the medical sciences and from life insurance industries demonstrating that serum GGT is a superior marker for future disease risk, when compared against multiple other known mortality risk factors.

Gene knockout is a genetic engineering technique that can modify the metabolism of microbial cells to obtain desirable phenotypes. Optimisation algorithms have been developed to identify the effects of gene knockout. However, the complexities of metabolic networks have made the process of identifying the effects of genetic modification on desirable phenotypes challenging. Furthermore, a vast number of reactions in cellular metabolism often lead to a combinatorial problem in obtaining optimal gene knockout. The computational time increases exponentially as the size of the problem increases. This work reports an extension of Bees Hill Flux Balance Analysis (BHFBA) to identify optimal gene knockouts to maximise the production yield of desired phenotypes while sustaining the growth rate. This proposed method functions by integrating OptKnock into BHFBA for validating the results automatically. The results show that the extension of BHFBA is suitable, reliable, and applicable in predicting gene knockout. Through several experiments conducted on Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Clostridium thermocellum as model organisms, extension of BHFBA has shown better performance in terms of computational time, stability, growth rate, and production yield of desired phenotypes.

In general, there is no single algorithm that is suitable for all types of data, conditions, and applications. Each algorithm has its own advantages, limitations, and deficiencies. Hence, research for novel and effective approaches for unsupervised data classification is still active. In this paper a heuristic algorithm, Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO) algorithm, was adapted for data clustering problems by modifying the main operators of BBO algorithm, which is inspired from the natural biogeography distribution of different species. Similar to other population-based algorithms, BBO algorithm starts with an initial population of candidate solutions to an optimization problem and an objective function that is calculated for them. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm assessment was carried on six medical and real life datasets and was compared with eight well known and recent unsupervised data classification algorithms. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed evolutionary optimization algorithm is efficient for unsupervised data classification.

10.1118/1.4916088  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis  |  support vector machines  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Purpose:  To investigate the importance of presurgical computed tomography (CT) intensity and texture information from ground-glass opacities (GGO) and solid nodule components for the prediction of adenocarcinoma recurrence. 
  Methods:  For this study, 101 patients with surgically resected stage I adenocarcinoma were selected. During the follow-up period, 17 patients had disease recurrence with six associated cancer-related deaths. GGO and solid tumor components were delineated on presurgical CT scans by a radiologist. Computational texture models of GGO and solid regions were built using linear combinations of steerable Riesz wavelets learned with linear support vector machines (SVMs). Unlike other traditional texture attributes, the proposed texture models are designed to encode local image scales and directions that are specific to GGO and solid tissue. The responses of the locally steered models were used as texture attributes and compared to the responses of unaligned Riesz wavelets. The texture attributes were combined with CT intensities to predict tumor recurrence and patient hazard according to disease-free survival (DFS) time. Two families of predictive models were compared: LASSO and SVMs, and their survival counterparts: Cox-LASSO and survival SVMs. 
  Results:  The best-performing predictive model of patient hazard was associated with a concordance index (C-index) of 0.81 ± 0.02 and was based on the combination of the steered models and CT intensities with survival SVMs. The same feature group and the LASSO model yielded the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.8 ± 0.01 for predicting tumor recurrence, although no statistically significant difference was found when compared to using intensity features solely. For all models, the performance was found to be significantly higher when image attributes were based on the solid components solely versus using the entire tumors (p &lt; 3.08 × 10(-5)). 
  Conclusions:  This study constitutes a novel perspective on how to interpret imaging information from CT examinations by suggesting that most of the information related to adenocarcinoma aggressiveness is related to the intensity and morphological properties of solid components of the tumor. The prediction of adenocarcinoma relapse was found to have low specificity but very high sensitivity. Our results could be useful in clinical practice to identify patients for which no recurrence is expected with a very high confidence using a presurgical CT scan only. It also provided an accurate estimation of the risk of recurrence after a given duration t from surgical resection (i.e., C-index = 0.81 ± 0.02).

 10.1016/j.joca.2017.09.001  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Smart Healthcare  |  AI  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Objective:  Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is among the higher contributors to global disability. Despite its high prevalence, currently, there is no cure for this disease. Furthermore, the available diagnostic approaches have large precision errors and low sensitivity. Therefore, there is a need for new biomarkers to correctly identify early knee OA. 
  Method:  We have created an analytics pipeline based on machine learning to identify small models (having few variables) that predict the 30-months incidence of knee OA (using multiple clinical and structural OA outcome measures) in overweight middle-aged women without knee OA at baseline. The data included clinical variables, food and pain questionnaires, biochemical markers (BM) and imaging-based information. 
  Results:  All the models showed high performance (AUC &gt; 0.7) while using only a few variables. We identified both the importance of each variable within the models as well its direction. Finally, we compared the performance of two models with the state-of-the-art approaches available in the literature. 
  Conclusions:  We showed the potential of applying machine learning to generate predictive models for the knee OA incidence. Imaging-based information were found particularly important in the proposed models. Furthermore, our analysis confirmed the relevance of known BM for knee OA. Overall, we propose five highly predictive small models that can be possibly adopted for an early prediction of knee OA.

Here, we report a high sensitivity, ultrathin, and transparent pressure sensor based on wrinkled graphene prepared by a facile liquid-phase shrink method. Two pieces of wrinkled graphene are face to face assembled into a pressure sensor, in which a porous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membrane with the thickness of only 200 nm was used to insulate the two layers of graphene. The pressure sensor exhibits ultrahigh operating sensitivity (6.92 kPa<sup>-1</sup>), resulting from the insulation in its inactive state and conduction under compression. Formation of current pathways is attributed to the contact of graphene wrinkles through the pores of AAO membrane. In addition, the pressure sensor is also an on/off and energy saving device, due to the complete isolation between the two graphene layers when the sensor is not subjected to any pressure. We believe that our high-performance pressure sensor is an ideal candidate for integration in flexible electronics, but also paves the way for other 2D materials to be involved in the fabrication of pressure sensors.

Genome-wide regulations of immune response genes of inbred chickens with different genetic backgrounds, following very virulent infectious bursal disease virus (vvIBDV) infection are poorly characterized. Therefore, this study aims to analyse the bursal tissue transcriptome of six inbred chicken lines 6, 7, 15, N, O and P following infection with vvIBDV strain UK661 using strand-specific next-generation sequencing, by highlighting important genes and pathways involved in the infected chicken during peak infection at 3 days post-infection. All infected chickens succumbed to the infection without major variations among the different lines. However, based on the viral loads and bursal lesion scoring, lines P and 6 can be considered as the most susceptible lines, while lines 15 and N were regarded as the least affected lines. Transcriptome profiling of the bursa identified 4588 genes to be differentially expressed, with 2985 upregulated and 1642 downregulated genes, in which these genes were commonly or uniquely detected in all or several infected lines. Genes that were upregulated are primarily pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and IFN-related. Various genes that are associated with B-cell functions and genes related to apoptosis were downregulated, together with the genes involved in p53 signalling. In conclusion, bursal transcriptome profiles of different inbred lines showed differential expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, Th1 cytokines, JAK-STAT signalling genes, MAPK signalling genes, and their related pathways following vvIBDV infection.

10.3892/mmr.2017.7457  |  Genetics  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   The present study aimed to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). RNA‑sequencing profiles GSM629264 and GSM629265, from the GSE25599 data set, were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and processed by quality evaluation. GSM629264 and GSM629265 were from HCC and adjacent non‑cancerous tissues, respectively. TopHat software was used for alignment analysis, followed by the detection of novel splicing sites. In addition, the Cufflinks software package was used to analyze gene expressions, and the Cuffdiff program was used to screen for differently expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed splicing variants. Gene ontology functional enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses of DEGs were also performed. Transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate DEGs were identified, and a protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. The hub node in the PPI network was obtained, and the TFs and miRNAs that regulated the hub node were further predicted. The quality of the sequencing data met the standards for analysis, and the clean reads were ~65%. Most sequencing reads mapped into coding sequence exons (CDS_exons), whereas other reads mapped into exon 3' untranslated regions (UTR_Exons), 5'UTR_Exons and Introns. Upregulated and downregulated DEGs between HCC and adjacent non‑cancerous tissues were screened. Genes of differentially expressed splicing variants were identified, including vesicle‑associated membrane protein 4, phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class C, protein disulfide isomerase family A member 4 and growth arrest specific 5. Screened DEGs were enriched in the complement pathway. In the PPI network, ubiquitin C (UBC) was the hub node. UBC was predicted to be regulated by several TFs, including specificity protein 1 (SP1), FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (FOS), proto‑oncogene c‑JUN (JUN), FOS‑like antigen 2 (FOSL2) and SWI/SNF‑related, matrix‑associated, actin‑dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily A, member 4 (SMARCA4), and several miRNAs, including miR‑30 and miR‑181. Results from the present study demonstrated that UBC, SP1, FOS, JUN, FOSL2, SMARCA4, miR‑30 and miR‑181 may participate in the development of HCC.

Such stationary activity of neurons may be expected for recordings from in vitro slices or anesthetized animals. However, modeling activity of cortical circuitries of awake animals has been more challenging because both spike-rates and interactions can change according to sensory stimulation, behavior, or an internal state of the brain. Previous approaches modeling the dynamics of neural interactions suffer from computational cost; therefore, its application was limited to only a dozen neurons. Here by introducing multiple analytic approximation methods to a state-space model of neural population activity, we make it possible to estimate dynamic pairwise interactions of up to 60 neurons. More specifically, we applied the pseudolikelihood approximation to the state-space model, and combined it with the Bethe or TAP mean-field approximation to make the sequential Bayesian estimation of the model parameters possible. The large-scale analysis allows us to investigate dynamics of macroscopic properties of neural circuitries underlying stimulus processing and behavior. We show that the model accurately estimates dynamics of network properties such as sparseness, entropy, and heat capacity by simulated data, and demonstrate utilities of these measures by analyzing activity of monkey V4 neurons as well as a simulated balanced network of spiking neurons.

Phonotactic knowledge-knowledge of the allowable sound combinations in a language-remains particularly understudied. The purpose of this study was to investigate the brain regions crucial to phonotactic knowledge in left-hemisphere stroke survivors. Results were compared to areas in which gray matter anatomy related to phonotactic knowledge in healthy controls. 44 patients with chronic left-hemisphere stroke, and 32 controls performed an English-likeness rating task on 60 auditory non-words of varying phonotactic regularities. They were asked to rate on a 1-5 scale, how close each non-word sounded to English. Patients' performance was compared to that of healthy controls, using mixed effects modeling. Multivariate lesion-symptom mapping and voxel-based morphometry were used to find the brain regions important for phonotactic processing in patients and controls respectively. The results showed that compared to controls, stroke survivors were less sensitive to phonotactic regularity differences. Lesion-symptom mapping demonstrated that a loss of sensitivity to phonotactic regularities was associated with lesions in left angular gyrus and posterior middle temporal gyrus. Voxel-based morphometry also revealed a positive correlation between gray matter density in left angular gyrus and sensitivity to phonotactic regularities in controls. We suggest that the angular gyrus is used to compare the incoming speech stream to internal predictions based on the frequency of sound sequences in the language derived from stored lexical representations in the posterior middle temporal gyrus.

10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00499  |  Drug Discovery, Treatment  |  Drug Discovery, Treatment  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Calcineurin is a critical cell-signaling protein that orchestrates growth, stress response, virulence, and antifungal drug resistance in several fungal pathogens. Blocking calcineurin signaling increases the efficacy of several currently available antifungals and suppresses drug resistance. We demonstrate the application of a novel scanning quadrupole DIA method for the analysis of changes in the proteins coimmunoprecipitated with calcineurin during therapeutic antifungal drug treatments of the deadly human fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Our experimental design afforded an assessment of the precision of the method as demonstrated by peptide- and protein-centric analysis from eight replicates of the study pool QC samples. Two distinct classes of clinically relevant antifungal drugs that are guideline recommended for the treatment of invasive "aspergillosis" caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, the azoles (voriconazole) and the echinocandins (caspofungin and micafungin), which specifically target the fungal plasma membrane and the fungal cell wall, respectively, were chosen to distinguish variations occurring in the proteins coimmunoprecipitated with calcineurin. Novel potential interactors were identified in response to the different drug treatments that are indicative of the possible role for calcineurin in regulating these effectors. Notably, treatment with voriconazole showed increased immunoprecipitation of key proteins involved in membrane ergosterol biosynthesis with calcineurin. In contrast, echinocandin (caspofungin or micafungin) treatments caused increased immunoprecipitation of proteins involved in cell-wall biosynthesis and septation. Furthermore, abundant coimmunoprecipitation of ribosomal proteins with calcineurin occurred exclusively in echinocandins treatment, indicating reprogramming of cellular growth mechanisms during different antifungal drug treatments. While variations in the observed calcineurin immunoprecipitated proteins may also be due to changes in their expression levels under different drug treatments, this study suggests an important role for calcineurin-dependent cellular mechanisms in response to antifungal treatment of A. fumigatus that warrants future studies.

These metals include essential metals such as zinc (Zn) or manganese (Mn) and non-essential metals like cadmium (Cd) or lead (Pb). Although a few heavy metal transporters have been well identified in model plants (e.g. Arabidopsis and rice), little is known about their functionality in rapeseed (Brassica napus). B. napus is an important oil crop ranking the third largest sources of vegetable oil over the world. Importantly, B. napus has long been considered as a desirable candidate for phytoremediation owning to its massive dry weight productivity and moderate to high Cd accumulation. In this study, 270 metal transporter genes (MTGs) from B. napus genome were identified and annotated using bioinformatics and high-throughput sequencing. Most of the MTGs (74.8%, 202/270) were validated by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) the seedling libraries. Based on the sequence identity, nine superfamilies including YSL, OPT, NRAMP, COPT, ZIP, CDF/MTP, HMA, MRP and PDR have been classified. RNA-sequencing profiled 202 non-redundant MTGs from B. napus seedlings, of which, 108 MTGs were differentially expressed and 62 genes were significantly induced under Cd stress. These differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are dispersed in the rapeseed genome. Some of the genes were well confirmed by qRT-PCR. Analysis of the genomic distribution of MTGs on B. napus chromosomes revealed that their evolutional expansion was probably through localized allele duplications.

Still, health care providers face significant clinical and economic challenges when introducing innovations. 
  Methods:  Prospectively derived administrative cost data of patients who were coded with a primary diagnosis of obesity (ICD-10 code E.66.X), a procedure of gastric bypass surgery (CHOP code 44.3), and a robotic identifier (CHOP codes 00.90.50 or 00.39) during the years 2012 to 2015 was analyzed and compared to the triggered reimbursement for this patient cohort. 
  Results:  A total of 348 patients were identified. The mean number of diagnoses was 2.7 and the mean length of stay was 5.9 days. The overall mean cost per patients was Swiss Francs (CHF) from 2012 to 2014 that was 21,527, with a mean reimbursement of CHF 24,917. Cost of the surgery in 2015 was comparable to the previous years with CHF 22,550.0 (p = 0.6618), but reimbursement decreased significantly to CHF 20,499.0 (0.0001). 
  Conclusions:  The average cost for robotic gastric bypass surgery fell well below the average reimbursement within the Swiss DRG system between 2012 and 2014, and this robotic procedure was a DRG winner for that period. However, the Swiss DRG system has matured over the years with a significant decrease resulting in a deficit for robotic gastric bypass surgery in 2015. This stipulates a discussion as to how health care providers should continue offering robotic gastric bypass surgery, particularly in the light of developing clinical evidence.

There is heterogeneity among this CSC population that leads to multiple subpopulations with their own distinct biological features and protein expression. The protein expression and function may be impacted by amino acid variants that can occur largely due to single nucleotide changes. We have thus performed proteomic analysis of breast CSC subpopulations by mass spectrometry to study the presence of single amino acid variants (SAAVs) and their relation to breast cancer. We have used CSC markers to isolate pure breast CSC subpopulation fractions (ALDH+ and CD44+/CD24- cell populations) and the mature luminal cells (CD49f-EpCAM+) from the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. By searching the Swiss-CanSAAVs database, 374 unique SAAVs were identified in total, where 27 are cancer-related SAAVs. 135 unique SAAVs were found in the CSC population compared with the mature luminal cells. The distribution of SAAVs detected in MCF-7 cells was compared with those predicted from the Swiss-CanSAAVs database, where we found distinct differences in the numbers of SAAVs detected relative to that expected from the Swiss-CanSAAVs database for several of the amino acids.

The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor MYC2 has attracted attention as a master regulator of JA signalling in dicotyledonous plants. However, how MYC2 functions in monocotyledonous plants, including agriculturally important crops such as cultivated rice, has been poorly understood. To elucidate the comprehensive effects of rice MYC2 (OsMYC2) on the JA-inducible transcriptional modifications, we performed RNA-sequencing by using OsMYC2-knockdown plants (osmyc2RNAi). In osmyc2RNAi, JA-inducible expression of many defence-related genes, for example chitinases and proteinase inhibitors, was compromised. Decrease in JA-dependent activation of the biosynthetic pathways of specialised metabolites, especially defence compounds, was also evident in the osmyc2RNAi line. Furthermore, a substantial change was noted in the expression of distinct types of transcription factors, such as MYB-type factors, likely depicting the importance of OsMYC2 in not only defence responses but also other morphogenetic events. Our findings provide fundamental information to understand the overall functions of MYC2 in JA signalling in monocotyledonous plants, which might yield agricultural benefits.

In addition, it is currently widely accepted that plant-to-plant communication allows specific neighbors to be warned of likely incoming stress (defense priming). Systemin is a plant peptide hormone promoting the systemic response to herbivory in tomato. This 18-aa peptide is also able to induce the release of bioactive Volatile Organic Compounds, thus also promoting the interaction between the tomato and the third trophic level (e.g. predators and parasitoids of insect pests). In this work, using a combination of gene expression (RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR), behavioral and chemical approaches, we demonstrate that systemin triggers metabolic changes of the plant that are capable of inducing a primed state in neighboring unchallenged plants. At the molecular level, the primed state is mainly associated with an elevated transcription of pattern -recognition receptors, signaling enzymes and transcription factors. Compared to naïve plants, systemin-primed plants were significantly more resistant to herbivorous pests, more attractive to parasitoids and showed an increased response to wounding. Small peptides are nowadays considered fundamental signaling molecules in many plant processes and this work extends the range of downstream effects of this class of molecules to intraspecific plant-to-plant communication.

Due to its potential threat to human beings, the type strain of this species LMG 6003T was completely sequenced in this study. The genomic analysis revealed that the genome of LMG 6003T consists of one circular DNA chromosome of 6 492 697 bp with a GC content of 65.10%. The entire genome contains 6208 predicted coding genes, 61 tRNAs and 13 rRNA genes. Comparative genome analysis between LMG 6003T and another selected 10 sequenced Achromobacter revealed that 725 genes only exist in LMG 6003T. In particular, these genes include several important pathogenic-related genes such as Type IV prepilin peptidase (TadV/CpaA), Type VI secretion lipoprotein (VasD) and type 1 fimbriae major subunit (FimA). Genomic island (GI) analysis also suggests the existence of GIs in LMG 6003T. All these results strongly suggest the unique genomic features in LMG 6003T against other Achromobacter species. This report will provide us with an extended understanding of A. insolitus at the genomic level and would be helpful for understanding the evolution of the Achromobacter genus.

Brittle 1, encoded by BT1, is a transporter of adenosine diphosphate-glucose, which plays an important role in the biosynthesis of starch in the endosperm of cereals. Here, we report that the promoter (pZmBT1) of the maize BT1 homolog, ZmBT1, contains an MBSI site (TAACTG), which is important for its activity. Moreover, high expression level of the gene for ZmMYB14 transcription factor was observed in the maize endosperm; its expression pattern was similar to those of the starch synthesis-related genes in maize seeds. ZmMYB14 is a typical 2R-MYB transcription factor localized in the nucleus and possessed transcriptional activation activity. ZmMYB14 could bind to the region of pZmBT1 from -280 to -151 bp and promote its activity through the TAACTG site. It was also observed to promote the activity of pZmSh2, pZmBt2, pZmGBSSI, pZmSSI, and pZmSBE1 in the maize endosperm in transient gene overexpression assays. Furthermore, ZmMYB14 was also shown to bind directly to the promoters of six starch-synthesizing genes, ZmGBSSI, ZmSSI, ZmSSIIa, ZmSBE1, ZmISA1, and ZmISA2 in yeast. These findings indicate that ZmMYB14 functions as a key regulator of ZmBT1 and is closely related to the biosynthesis of starch. Our results provide crucial information related to the regulation of starch biosynthesis in maize and would be helpful in devising strategies for modulating starch production in maize endosperm.

Using <i>ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE1a</i> (<i>AOX1a</i>) gene expression as a model system of retrograde or stress signaling between mitochondria and the nucleus, MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN29 (MYB29) was identified as a negative regulator (<i>regulator of alternative oxidase1a 7</i> [<i>rao7</i>] mutant) in a genetic screen of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>rao7/myb29</i> mutants have increased levels of AOX1a transcript and protein compared to wild type after induction with antimycin A. A variety of genes previously associated with the mitochondrial stress response also display enhanced transcript abundance, indicating that RAO7/MYB29 negatively regulates mitochondrial stress responses in general. Meta-analysis of hormone-responsive marker genes and identification of downstream transcription factor networks revealed that MYB29 functions in the complex interplay of ethylene, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and reactive oxygen species signaling by regulating the expression of various ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR and WRKY transcription factors. Despite an enhanced induction of mitochondrial stress response genes, <i>rao7</i>/<i>myb29</i> mutants displayed an increased sensitivity to combined moderate light and drought stress. These results uncover interactions between mitochondrial retrograde signaling and the regulation of glucosinolate biosynthesis, both regulated by RAO7/MYB29. This common regulator can explain why perturbation of the mitochondrial function leads to transcriptomic responses overlapping with responses to biotic stress.

They are highly immunogenic because they are not present in normal tissues and hence bypass central thymic tolerance. Although neoantigens were long-envisioned as optimal targets for an anti-tumour immune response, their systematic discovery and evaluation only became feasible with the recent availability of massively parallel sequencing for detection of all coding mutations within tumours, and of machine learning approaches to reliably predict those mutated peptides with high-affinity binding of autologous human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules. We hypothesized that vaccination with neoantigens can both expand pre-existing neoantigen-specific T-cell populations and induce a broader repertoire of new T-cell specificities in cancer patients, tipping the intra-tumoural balance in favour of enhanced tumour control. Here we demonstrate the feasibility, safety, and immunogenicity of a vaccine that targets up to 20 predicted personal tumour neoantigens. Vaccine-induced polyfunctional CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells targeted 58 (60%) and 15 (16%) of the 97 unique neoantigens used across patients, respectively. These T cells discriminated mutated from wild-type antigens, and in some cases directly recognized autologous tumour. Of six vaccinated patients, four had no recurrence at 25 months after vaccination, while two with recurrent disease were subsequently treated with anti-PD-1 (anti-programmed cell death-1) therapy and experienced complete tumour regression, with expansion of the repertoire of neoantigen-specific T cells. These data provide a strong rationale for further development of this approach, alone and in combination with checkpoint blockade or other immunotherapies.

Here, we systematically analyzed the copy number alterations and differentially transcribed genes. Integrative analysis of the association between copy number variants and differential gene expression suggested that copy number variants will lead to aberrant expression of the corresponding genes. We performed a KEGG pathway and GO analysis, which revealed that cell cycle may have an effective role in the progression of esophageal cancer. FAM60A was then screened out as a potential prognostic factor through survival analysis and correlation analysis with clinical-pathological parameters. We subsequently showed that silencing of FAM60A could inhibit esophageal carcinoma tumor cell growth, migration and invasion in vitro. Through the bioinformatic analysis, we predict that FAM60A may act as a transcriptional factor to regulate genes that are correlated with each cell cycle. In summary, we comprehensively analyzed copy number segments and transcriptional expression profiles, which provided a novel approach to identify clinical biomarkers and therapeutic targets of esophageal carcinoma.

In this study, we mapped the spatio-temporal specificity of gene expression profiles in rice under excess NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and the changes in gene expression in root and shoot at various time points by RNA-Seq (Quantification) using Illumina HiSeqTM 2000. By comparative analysis, 307 and 675 genes were found to be up-regulated after 4h and 12h of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> exposure in the root, respectively. In the shoot, 167 genes were up-regulated at 4h, compared with 320 at 12h. According to KEGG analysis, up-regulated DEGs mainly participate in phenylpropanoid (such as flavonoid) and amino acid (such as proline, cysteine, and methionine) metabolism, which is believed to improve NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> stress tolerance through adjustment of energy metabolism in the shoot, while defense and signaling pathways, guiding whole-plant acclimation, play the leading role in the root. We furthermore critically assessed the roles of key phytohormones, and found abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene (ET) to be the major regulatory molecules responding to excess NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and activating the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signal-transduction pathway. Moreover, we found up-regulated hormone-associated genes are involved in regulating flavonoid biosynthesis and are regulated by tissue flavonoid accumulation.

10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.10.038  |  None  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Mammary gland is an important organ for milk synthesis and secretion. It undergoes dramatic physiological changes to adapt the shift from peak to late lactation stage. Protein plays a final very vital role in many life functions, and the protein changes during different lactation stages potentially reflect the biology of lactation and the functions of mammary gland in cows. In current study, we adopted tandem mass tags label-based quantitative analysis technique and to investigate proteome changes occurring in bovine mammary gland from peak to late lactation stages. A total of 3753 proteins from mammary tissues taken at two lactation points from four individual cows by biopsy were quantified, out of which 179 proteins were expressed differentially between two stages. We observed five new DEPs (AACS, DHCR7, GSTM3, SFRP1 and SFRP4) and nine functional well-studies known proteins (PLIN2, LPIN1, PLIN3, GSN, CD74, MMP2, SOD1, SOD3 and GPX3) related to milk performance and mammary morphology. Bioinformatics analyses of the DEPs showed a majority of the up-regulated proteins during late lactation stage were related to apoptosis and immune process, while the downregulated proteins were mainly involved in localization, lipid metabolic and transport process. This suggests that the mammary gland can adapt to different molecular functions according to the biological need of the animal. From the integrated analysis of the differentially expressed proteins with known quantitative trait loci and genome-wide association study data, we identified 95 proteins may potentially affect milking performance. We expect findings in this study could be a valuable resource for future studies investigating the bovine proteome and functional studies.

10.3390/s17040827  |  Diagnosis, Smart Healthcare  |  Diagnosis  |  DataGathering  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Inertial measurement units (IMUs) are devices used, among other fields, in health applications, since they are light, small and effective. More concretely, IMUs have been demonstrated to be useful in the monitoring of motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). In this sense, most of previous works have attempted to assess PD symptoms in controlled environments or short tests. This paper presents the design of an IMU, called 9 × 3, that aims to assess PD symptoms, enabling the possibility to perform a map of patients' symptoms at their homes during long periods. The device is able to acquire and store raw inertial data for artificial intelligence algorithmic training purposes. Furthermore, the presented IMU enables the real-time execution of the developed and embedded learning models. Results show the great flexibility of the 9 × 3, storing inertial information and algorithm outputs, sending messages to external devices and being able to detect freezing of gait and bradykinetic gait. Results obtained in 12 patients exhibit a sensitivity and specificity over 80%. Additionally, the system enables working 23 days (at waking hours) with a 1200 mAh battery and a sampling rate of 50 Hz, opening up the possibility to be used for other applications like wellbeing and sports.

With regard to radiographic phenotypes, generally unconnected through present understanding to the presence of specific mutations, artificial intelligence methods can automatically quantify phenotypic characters by using predefined, engineered algorithms or automatic deep-learning methods, a process also known as radiomics. Here we demonstrate how imaging phenotypes can be connected to somatic mutations through an integrated analysis of independent datasets of 763 lung adenocarcinoma patients with somatic mutation testing and engineered CT image analytics. We developed radiomic signatures capable of distinguishing between tumor genotypes in a discovery cohort (<i>n</i> = 353) and verified them in an independent validation cohort (<i>n</i> = 352). All radiomic signatures significantly outperformed conventional radiographic predictors (tumor volume and maximum diameter). We found a radiomic signature related to radiographic heterogeneity that successfully discriminated between EGFR<sup>+</sup> and EGFR<sup>-</sup> cases (AUC = 0.69). Combining this signature with a clinical model of EGFR status (AUC = 0.70) significantly improved prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.75). The highest performing signature was capable of distinguishing between EGFR<sup>+</sup> and KRAS<sup>+</sup> tumors (AUC = 0.80) and, when combined with a clinical model (AUC = 0.81), substantially improved its performance (AUC = 0.86). A KRAS<sup>+</sup>/KRAS<sup>-</sup> radiomic signature also showed significant albeit lower performance (AUC = 0.63) and did not improve the accuracy of a clinical predictor of KRAS status. Our results argue that somatic mutations drive distinct radiographic phenotypes that can be predicted by radiomics. This work has implications for the use of imaging-based biomarkers in the clinic, as applied noninvasively, repeatedly, and at low cost. <i>Cancer Res; 77(14); 3922-30. ©2017 AACR</i>.

10.3233/JAD-161057  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  White matter signal abnormalities (WMSA) (also known as 'hyperintensities') on MRI are commonly seen in normal aging and increases have been noted in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but whether there is a spatial specificity to these increases is unknown. 
  Objective:  To discern whether or not there is a spatial pattern of WMSA in the brains of individuals with AD that differs from those who exhibit cognitively healthy aging. 
  Method:  Structural MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative public database were used to quantify WMSA in 35 regions of interest (ROIs). Regional measures were compared between cognitively healthy older controls (OC; n = 107) and individuals with a clinical diagnosis of AD (n = 127). Regional WMSA volume was also assessed in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 74) who were 6, 12, and 24 months away from AD conversion. 
  Results:  WMSA volume was significantly greater in AD compared to OC in 24 out of 35 ROIs after controlling for age, and nine were significantly higher after normalizing for total WMSA. Regions with greater WMSA volume in AD included rostral frontal, inferior temporal, and inferior parietal WM. In MCI, frontal and temporal regions demonstrated significantly greater WMSA volume with decreasing time-to-AD-conversion. 
  Discussion:  Individuals with AD have greater regional volume of WMSA compared to OC regardless of age or total WMSA volume. Accumulation of regional WMSA is linked to time to AD conversion in individuals with MCI. These findings indicate WMSA is an important pathological component of AD development.

However, it remains unknown whether these proposed approaches could also perform well in the clinical use of a multifunctional prosthesis control. In this study, the online effect of arm position variation on motion identification was evaluated by using a motion-test environment (MTE) developed to mimic the real-time control of myoelectric prostheses. The performance of different classifier configurations in reducing the impact of arm position variation was investigated using four real-time metrics based on dataset obtained from transradial amputees. The results of this study showed that, compared to the commonly used motion classification method, the CC and MPC configurations improved the real-time performance across seven classes of movements in five different arm positions (8.7% and 12.7% increments of motion completion rate, resp.). The results also indicated that high offline classification accuracy might not ensure good real-time performance under variable arm positions, which necessitated the investigation of the real-time control performance to gain proper insight on the clinical implementation of EMG-pattern-recognition-based controllers for limb amputees.

The size of these datasets creates a need for automated clustering methods to group the streamlines into meaningful bundles. Conventional clustering techniques group streamlines based on their spatial coordinates. Neuroanatomists, however, define white-matter bundles based on the anatomical structures that they go through or next to, rather than their spatial coordinates. Thus we propose a similarity measure for clustering streamlines based on their position relative to cortical and subcortical brain regions. We incorporate this measure into a hierarchical clustering algorithm and compare it to a measure that relies on Euclidean distance, using data from the Human Connectome Project. We show that the anatomical similarity measure leads to a 20% improvement in the overlap of clusters with manually labeled tracts. Importantly, this is achieved without introducing any prior information from a tract atlas into the clustering algorithm, therefore without imposing the existence of any named tracts.

In normal cells, activity of p53 is controlled by interaction with MDM2. The well understood p53-MDM2 interaction facilitates design of ligands that could potentially disrupt or prevent the complexation owing to its emergence as an important objective for cancer therapy. However, thermodynamic quantification of the p53-peptide induced structural changes of the MDM2-protein remains an area to be explored. This study attempts to understand the conformational free energy and entropy costs due to this complex formation from the histograms of dihedral angles generated from molecular dynamics simulations. Residue-specific quantification illustrates that, hydrophobic residues of the protein contribute maximum to the conformational thermodynamic changes. Thermodynamic quantification of structural changes of the protein unfold the fact that, p53 binding provides a source of inter-element cooperativity among the protein secondary structural elements, where the highest affected structural elements (a2 and a4) found at the binding site of the protein affects faraway structural elements (ß1 and Loop1) of the protein. The communication perhaps involves water mediated hydrogen bonded network formation. Further, we infer that in inhibitory F19A mutation of P53, though Phe19 is important in the recognition process, it has less prominent contribution in the stability of the complex. Collectively, this study provides vivid microscopic understanding of the interaction within the protein complex along with exploring mutation sites, which will contribute further to engineer the protein function and binding affinity.

10.1002/prot.25432  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis  |  Prognosis  |  profile-profile alignments, FORTE  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Proteins often exist as their multimeric forms when they function as so-called biological assemblies consisting of the specific number and arrangement of protein subunits. Consequently, elucidating biological assemblies is necessary to improve understanding of protein function. Template-Based Modeling (TBM), based on known protein structures, has been used widely for protein structure prediction. Actually, TBM has become an increasingly useful approach in recent years because of the increased amounts of information related to protein amino acid sequences and three-dimensional structures. An apparently similar situation exists for biological assembly structure prediction as protein complex structures in the PDB increase, although the inference of biological assemblies is not a trivial task. Many methods using TBM, including ours, have been developed for protein structure prediction. Using enhanced profile-profile alignments, we participated in the 12th Community Wide Experiment on the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP12), as the FONT team (Group # 480). Herein, we present experimental procedures and results of retrospective analyses using our approach for the Quaternary Structure Prediction category of CASP12. We performed profile-profile alignments of several types, based on FORTE, our profile-profile alignment algorithm, to identify suitable templates. Results show that these alignment results enable us to find templates in almost all possible cases. Moreover, we have come to understand the necessity of developing a model selection method that provides improved accuracy. Results also demonstrate that, to some extent, finding templates of protein complexes is useful even for MEDIUM and HARD assembly prediction.

The current bioinformatics challenge is to interpret the data and underlying biology, where efficient algorithms for analyzing heterogeneous high-throughput data using biological networks are becoming increasingly valuable. In this paper, we propose a software package based on the Prize-collecting Steiner Forest graph optimization approach. The PCSF package performs fast and user-friendly network analysis of high-throughput data by mapping the data onto a biological networks such as protein-protein interaction, gene-gene interaction or any other correlation or coexpression based networks. Using the interaction networks as a template, it determines high-confidence subnetworks relevant to the data, which potentially leads to predictions of functional units. It also interactively visualizes the resulting subnetwork with functional enrichment analysis.

Conventional AI methods are applied using features selected by a human operator, which are manually extracted based on diagnostic techniques and field expertise. However, developing robust features for each diagnostic purpose is often labour-intensive and time-consuming, and the features extracted for one specific task may be unsuitable for others. In this paper, a novel AI method based on a deep belief network (DBN) is proposed for the unsupervised fault diagnosis of a gear transmission chain, and the genetic algorithm is used to optimize the structural parameters of the network. Compared to the conventional AI methods, the proposed method can adaptively exploit robust features related to the faults by unsupervised feature learning, thus requires less prior knowledge about signal processing techniques and diagnostic expertise. Besides, it is more powerful at modelling complex structured data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using datasets from rolling bearings and gearbox. To show the superiority of the proposed method, its performance is compared with two well-known classifiers, i.e., back propagation neural network (BPNN) and support vector machine (SVM). The fault classification accuracies are 99.26% for rolling bearings and 100% for gearbox when using the proposed method, which are much higher than that of the other two methods.

10.1371/journal.pone.0188196  |  Diagnosis  |  None, Other  |  Klassifikatoren  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Since anatomic MRI is presently not able to directly discern neuronal loss in Parkinson's Disease (PD), studying the associated functional connectivity (FC) changes seems a promising approach toward developing non-invasive and non-radioactive neuroimaging markers for this disease. While several groups have reported such FC changes in PD, there are also significant discrepancies between studies. Investigating the reproducibility of PD-related FC changes on independent datasets is therefore of crucial importance. We acquired resting-state fMRI scans for 43 subjects (27 patients and 16 normal controls, with 2 replicate scans per subject) and compared the observed FC changes with those obtained in two independent datasets, one made available by the PPMI consortium (91 patients, 18 controls) and a second one by the group of Tao Wu (20 patients, 20 controls). Unfortunately, PD-related functional connectivity changes turned out to be non-reproducible across datasets. This could be due to disease heterogeneity, but also to technical differences. To distinguish between the two, we devised a method to directly check for disease heterogeneity using random splits of a single dataset. Since we still observe non-reproducibility in a large fraction of random splits of the same dataset, we conclude that functional heterogeneity may be a dominating factor behind the lack of reproducibility of FC alterations in different rs-fMRI studies of PD. While global PD-related functional connectivity changes were non-reproducible across datasets, we identified a few individual brain region pairs with marginally consistent FC changes across all three datasets. However, training classifiers on each one of the three datasets to discriminate PD scans from controls produced only low accuracies on the remaining two test datasets. Moreover, classifiers trained and tested on random splits of the same dataset (which are technically homogeneous) also had low test accuracies, directly substantiating disease heterogeneity.

Several large-scale datasets derived from hundreds of human microbiome samples sourced from multiple studies are now publicly available.

To overcome these challenges, we developed GutCyc, a compendium of environmental pathway genome databases (ePGDBs) constructed from 418 assembled human microbiome datasets using MetaPathways, enabling reproducible functional metagenomic annotation. We also generated metabolic network reconstructions for each metagenome using the Pathway Tools software, empowering researchers and clinicians interested in visualizing and interpreting metabolic pathways encoded by the human gut microbiome. For the first time, GutCyc provides consistent annotations and metabolic pathway predictions, making possible comparative community analyses between health and disease states in inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, and type 2 diabetes. GutCyc data products are searchable online, or may be downloaded and explored locally using MetaPathways and Pathway Tools.

Recently, a novel digital technology was developed to investigate pain location and pain extent. The aim of this study was to describe pain location and pain extent in musicians using a digital method for pain drawing (PD) analysis. Additionally, the association between PD variables and clinical features were explored in musicians with pain. 
  Methods:  One hundred and fifty-eight musicians (90 women and 68 men; aged 22.4 ± 3.6 years) were recruited from Swiss and U.K. conservatories. Participants were asked to complete a survey including both background musical information and clinical features, the QuickDASH (QD) questionnaire, and the digital PDs. 
  Results:  Of the 158 participants, 126 musicians (79.7%) reported having pain, with higher prevalence in the areas of the neck and shoulders, the lower back, and the right arm. The mean percentage of pain extent was 3.1% ± 6.5%. The mean QD score was higher for musicians with pain than for those without pain. Additionally, the results indicated a positive correlation between the QD score and pain extent, and there were significant correlations between age and pain intensity, as well as between pain extent and pain intensity. 
  Conclusions:  The high prevalence of pain among musicians has been confirmed using a digital technique for PD acquisition and analysis. In addition, positive correlations between pain extent and upper limb disability have been demonstrated. Our findings highlight the need for effective prevention and treatment strategies for musicians.

In stark contrast, biological neural networks continually adapt to changing domains, possibly by leveraging complex molecular machinery to solve many tasks simultaneously. In this study, we introduce <i>intelligent synapses</i> that bring some of this biological complexity into artificial neural networks. Each synapse accumulates task relevant information over time, and exploits this information to rapidly store new memories without forgetting old ones. We evaluate our approach on continual learning of classification tasks, and show that it dramatically reduces forgetting while maintaining computational efficiency.

Whether these postmortem changes are specific to ET remains to be investigated. We assessed CF-PC synaptic pathology in the postmortem cerebellum across a range of degenerative movement disorders [10 Parkinson's disease (PD) cases, 10 multiple system atrophy (MSA) cases, 10 spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) cases, and 20 ET cases] and 25 controls. We observed differences in terms of CF pathological features across these disorders. Specifically, PD cases and ET cases both had more CFs extending into the parallel fiber (PF) territory, but ET cases had more complex branching and increased length of CFs in the PF territory along with decreased CF synaptic density compared to PD cases. MSA cases and SCA1 cases had the most severely reduced CF synaptic density and a marked paucity of CFs extending into the PF territory. Furthermore, CFs in a subset of MSA cases formed collateral branches parallel to the PC layer, a feature not seen in other diagnostic groups. Using unsupervised cluster analysis, the cases and controls could all be categorized into four clusters based on the CF pathology and features of PC pathology, including counts of PCs and their axonal torpedoes. ET cases and PD cases co-segregated into two clusters, whereas SCA1 cases and MSA cases formed another cluster, separate from the control cluster. Interestingly, the presence of resting tremor seemed to be the clinical feature that separated the cases into the two ET-PD clusters. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that these degenerative movement disorders seem to differ with respect to the pattern of CF synaptic pathology they exhibit. It remains to be determined how these differences contribute to the clinical presentations of these diseases.

To address this issue, here we characterized lncRNA expression profile in primary human B cell response to TB infection using microarray assay. Several lncRNAs and mRNAs were chosen for RT-qPCR validation. Bioinformatics prediction was applied to delineate function of the deregulated mRNAs. We found that 844 lncRNAs and 597 mRNAs were differentially expressed between B cell samples from individuals with or without TB. KEGG pathway analysis for the deregulated mRNAs indicated a number of pathways, such as TB, TLR signaling pathway and antigen processing and presentation. Moreover, corresponding to the dysregulation of many lncRNAs, we also found that their adjacent protein-coding genes were also deregulated. Functional annotation for the corresponding mRNAs showed that these lncRNAs were mainly associated with TLR signaling, TGF-ß signaling. Interestingly, SOCS3, which is a critical negative regulator of cytokine response to TB infection and its nearby lncRNA XLOC_012582, were highly expressed in active TB B cells. Subsequent RT-qPCR results confirmed the changes. Whether upregulated XLOC_012582 causes SOCS3 overexpression and is eventually involved in the context of exacerbations of active TB represents an interesting issue that deserves to be further explored. Taken together, for the first time, we identified a set of deregulated lncRNAs in active TB B cells and their functions were predicted. Such findings provided novel insight into the pathogenesis of TB and further studies should focus on the function and pathogenic mechanisms of the lncRNAs involved in active TB.

Among various approaches to SDR, a promising method is based on the eigendecomposition of the outer product of the gradient of the conditional density of output given input. In this letter, we propose a novel estimator of the gradient of the logarithmic conditional density that directly fits a linear-in-parameter model to the true gradient under the squared loss. Thanks to this simple least-squares formulation, its solution can be computed efficiently in a closed form. Then we develop a new SDR method based on the proposed gradient estimator. We theoretically prove that the proposed gradient estimator, as well as the SDR solution obtained from it, achieves the optimal parametric convergence rate. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that our SDR method compares favorably with existing approaches in both accuracy and computational efficiency on a variety of artificial and benchmark data sets.

10.1007/s11596-017-1734-8  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Genetics  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Treatment, Genetics  |  microarray  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Esophageal cancer is a common malignant tumor, whose pathogenesis and prognosis factors are not fully understood. This study aimed to discover the gene clusters that have similar functions and can be used to predict the prognosis of esophageal cancer. The matched microarray and RNA sequencing data of 185 patients with esophageal cancer were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and gene co-expression networks were built without distinguishing between squamous carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. The result showed that 12 modules were associated with one or more survival data such as recurrence status, recurrence time, vital status or vital time. Furthermore, survival analysis showed that 5 out of the 12 modules were related to progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS). As the most important module, the midnight blue module with 82 genes was related to PFS, apart from the patient age, tumor grade, primary treatment success, and duration of smoking and tumor histological type. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that "glycoprotein binding" was the top enriched function of midnight blue module genes. Additionally, the blue module was the exclusive gene clusters related to OS. Platelet activating factor receptor (PTAFR) and feline Gardner-Rasheed (FGR) were the top hub genes in both modeling datasets and the STRING protein interaction database. In conclusion, our study provides novel insights into the prognosis-associated genes and screens out candidate biomarkers for esophageal cancer.

10.1002/jgm.2936  |  Prognosis, Genetics  |  Prognosis, Genetics  |  microarray, Fisher's ratio, feature elimination  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous disease and the most common adult leukemia in western countries. IgVH mutational status distinguishes two major types of CLL, each associated with a different prognosis and survival. Sequencing identified NOTCH1 and SF3B1 as the two main recurrent mutations. We described a novel method to clarify how these mutations affect gene expression by finding small-scale signatures that predict the IgVH, NOTCH1 and SF3B1 mutations. We subsequently defined the biological pathways and correlation networks involved in disease development, with the potential goal of identifying new drugable targets. 
  Methods:  We modeled a microarray dataset consisting of 48807 probes derived from 163 samples. The use of Fisher's ratio and fold change combined with feature elimination allowed us to identify the minimum number of genes with the highest predictive mutation power and, subsequently, we applied network and pathway analyses of these genes to identify their biological roles. 
  Results:  The mutational status of the patients was accurately predicted (94-99%) using small-scale gene signatures: 13 genes for IgVH, 60 for NOTCH1 and 22 for SF3B1. LPL plays an important role in the case of the IgVH mutation, whereas MSI2, LTK, TFEC and CNTAP2 are involved in the NOTCH1 mutation, and RPL32 and PLAGL1 are involved in the SF3B1 mutation. Four high discriminatory genes (IGHG1, MYBL1, NRIP1 and RGS1) are common to these three mutations. The IL-4-mediated signaling events pathway appears to be involved as a common mechanism and suggests an important role of the immune response mechanisms and antigen presentation. 
  Conclusions:  This retrospective analysis served to provide a deeper understanding of the effects of the different mutations in CLL disease progression, with the expectation that these findings will be clinically applied in the near future to the development of new drugs.

10.1017/S2045796017000014  |  Prognosis, Treatment  |  Prognosis, Treatment  |  logistic regression, random coefficient analysis  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Aims:  Poor recovery from depressive disorder has been shown to be related to low perceived social support and loneliness, but not to social network size or frequency of social interactions. Some studies suggest that the significance of social relationships for depression course may be greater in younger than in older patients, and may differ between men and women. None of the studies examined to what extent the different aspects of social relationships have unique or overlapping predictive values for depression course. It is the aim of the present study to examine the differential predictive values of social network characteristics, social support and loneliness for the course of depressive disorder, and to test whether these predictive associations are modified by gender or age. 
  Methods:  Two naturalistic cohort studies with the same design and overlapping instruments were combined to obtain a study sample of 1474 patients with a major depressive disorder, of whom 1181 (80.1%) could be studied over a 2-year period. Social relational variables were assessed at baseline. Two aspects of depression course were studied: remission at 2-year follow-up and change in depression severity over the follow-up period. By means of logistic regression and random coefficient analysis, the individual and combined predictive values of the different social relational variables for depression course were studied, controlling for potential confounders and checking for effect modification by age (below 60 v. 60 years or older) and gender. 
  Results:  Multiple aspects of the social network, social support and loneliness were related to depression course, independent of potential confounders - including depression severity - but when combined, their predictive values were found to overlap to a large extent. Only the social network characteristic of living in a larger household, the social support characteristic of few negative experiences with the support from a partner or close friend, and limited feelings of loneliness proved to have unique predictive value for a favourable course of depression. Little evidence was found for effect modification by gender or age. 
  Conclusions:  If depressed persons experience difficulties in their social relationships, this may impede their recovery. Special attention for interpersonal problems, social isolation and feelings of loneliness seems warranted in depression treatment and relapse prevention. It will be of great interest to test whether social relational interventions can contribute to better recovery and relapse prevention of depressive disorder.

The obstacle recognition library is designed and implemented to address the design and evaluation of obstacle detection in a transportation cyber-physical system. The library is integrated into a co-simulation framework that is supported on the interaction between SCANeR software and Matlab/Simulink. From the best of the authors' knowledge, two main contributions are reported in this paper. Firstly, the modelling and simulation of virtual on-chip light detection and ranging sensors in a cyber-physical system, for traffic scenarios, is presented. The cyber-physical system is designed and implemented in SCANeR. Secondly, three specific artificial intelligence-based methods for obstacle recognition libraries are also designed and applied using a sensory information database provided by SCANeR. The computational library has three methods for obstacle detection: a multi-layer perceptron neural network, a self-organization map and a support vector machine. Finally, a comparison among these methods under different weather conditions is presented, with very promising results in terms of accuracy. The best results are achieved using the multi-layer perceptron in sunny and foggy conditions, the support vector machine in rainy conditions and the self-organized map in snowy conditions.

Sequencing these repetitive regions is challenging, even with recent improvements in sequencing technologies. Among these repeats, a haplotype carrying a particular sequence and shortening of the D4Z4 array on human chromosome 4q35 causes one of the most prevalent forms of muscular dystrophy with autosomal-dominant inheritance, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). Here, we applied a nanopore-based ultra-long read sequencer to sequence a BAC clone containing 13 D4Z4 repeats and flanking regions. We successfully obtained the whole D4Z4 repeat sequence, including the pathogenic gene DUX4 in the last D4Z4 repeat. The estimated sequence accuracy of the total repeat region was 99.8% based on a comparison with the reference sequence. Errors were typically observed between purine or between pyrimidine bases. Further, we analyzed the D4Z4 sequence from publicly available ultra-long whole human genome sequencing data obtained by nanopore sequencing. This technology may be a new tool for studying D4Z4 repeats and pathomechanism of FSHD in the future and has the potential to widen our understanding of subtelomeric regions.

10.1007/s00198-016-3825-y  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis, Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   In male Caucasians with discordant hip bone mineral density (BMD), we applied the subcellular separation and proteome profiling to investigate the monocytic cytosol. Three BMD-associated proteins (ALDOA, MYH14, and Rap1B) were identified based on multiple omics evidence, and they may influence the pathogenic mechanisms of osteoporosis by regulating the activities of monocytes. 
  Introduction:  Osteoporosis is a serious public health problem, leading to significant mortality not only in aging females but also in males. Peripheral blood monocytes (PBMs) play important roles in bone metabolism by acting as precursors of osteoclasts and producing cytokines important for osteoclast development. The first cytosolic sub-proteome profiling analysis was performed in male PBMs to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) that are associated with BMDs and risk of osteoporosis. 
  Methods:  Here, we conducted a comparative proteomics analysis in PBMs from Caucasian male subjects with discordant hip BMD (29 low BMD vs. 30 high BMD). To decrease the proteome complexity and expand the coverage range of the cellular proteome, we separated the PBM proteome into several subcellular compartments and focused on the cytosolic fractions, which are involved in a wide range of fundamental biochemical processes. 
  Results:  Of the total of 3796 detected cytosolic proteins, we identified 16 significant (P &lt; 0.05) and an additional 22 suggestive (P &lt; 0.1) DEPs between samples with low vs. high hip BMDs. Some of the genes for DEPs, including ALDOA, MYH14, and Rap1B, showed an association with BMD in multiple omics studies (proteomic, transcriptomic, and genomic). Further bioinformatics analysis revealed the enrichment of DEPs in functional terms for monocyte proliferation, differentiation, and migration. 
  Conclusions:  The combination strategy of subcellular separation and proteome profiling allows an in-depth and refined investigation into the composition and functions of cytosolic proteome, which may shed light on the monocyte-mediated pathogenic mechanisms of osteoporosis.

10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b00955  |  Diagnosis  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Pre-eclampsia is a hypertensive disorder characterized by the new onset of hypertension &gt;140/90 mmHg and proteinuria after the 20th week of gestation. The disorder is multifactorial and originates with abnormal placentation. Comparison of the placental proteome of normotensive (n = 25) and pre-eclamptic (n = 25) patients by gel-free proteomic techniques identified a total of 2145 proteins in the placenta of which 180 were differentially expressed (&gt;1.3 fold, p &lt; 0.05). Gene ontology enrichment analysis of biological process suggested that the differentially expressed proteins belonged to various physiological processes such as angiogenesis, apoptosis, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and placental development, which are implicated in the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia. Some of the differentially expressed proteins were monitored in the plasma by multiple reaction monitoring analysis, which showed an increase in apolipoproteins A-I and A-II in gestational weeks 26-30 (2-fold, p &lt; 0.01), while haptoglobin and hemopexin decreased in gestational weeks 26-30 and week 40/at delivery (1.8 fold, p &lt; 0.01) in pre-eclamptic patients. This study provides a proteomic insight into the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia. Identified candidate proteins can be evaluated further for the development of potential biomarkers associated with pre-eclampsia pathogenesis.

This protein maintains a high degree of genetic variation among intra- and inter-host isolates. HIV Nef is relevant to HIV-associated neurological diseases (HAND) in patients treated with combined antiretroviral therapy because of the protein's role in promoting survival and migration of infected brain macrophages. In this study, we analyzed 2020 HIV Nef sequences derived from 22 different tissues and 31 subjects using a novel computational approach. This approach combines statistical regression and evolved neural networks (ENNs) to classify brain sequences based on the physical and chemical characteristics of functional Nef domains. Based on training, testing, and validation data, the method successfully classified brain Nef sequences at 84.5% and provided informative features for further examination. These included physicochemical features associated with the Src-homology-3 binding domain, the Nef loop (including the AP-2 Binding region), and a cytokine-binding domain. Non-brain sequences from patients with HIV-associated neurological disease were frequently classified as brain, suggesting that the approach could indicate neurological risk using blood-derived virus or for the development of biomarkers for use in assay systems aimed at drug efficacy studies for the treatment of HIV-associated neurological diseases.

We aimed to predict the contribution of schisantherin A and schisandrin A to drug-drug interaction (DDI) between Wuzhi capsule and tacrolimus using physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling. Firstly, the inhibition mechanism of schisantherin A and schisandrin A on CYP3A4/5 was investigated. Thereafter, PBPK models of schisantherin A, schisandrin A and tacrolimus were established. Finally, tacrolimus pharmacokinetics were evaluated after the combined use with schisantherin A or schisandrin A. The blood area under the curve (AUC) of tacrolimus increased 1.77- and 2.61-fold after a single dose and multiple doses of schisantherin A, respectively. Meanwhile, schisandrin A inhibited tacrolimus metabolism to a smaller extent. Also, it showed that mechanism-based inhibition (MBI) played a more important role in DDI than reversible inhibition after long-term administration, while reversible inhibition was comparable to MBI after single-dose administration. In conclusion, we utilized PBPK modelling to quantify the contribution of schisantherin A and schisandrin A to DDI between tacrolimus and Wuzhi capsule. This may provide more insights for the rational use of this drug combination.

A total of 81 differentially expressed miRNAs belonging to 29 families and 8133 mRNAs were identified. The Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses showed that genes encoding the DNA/RNA binding, catalytic activity and signalling molecules were all significantly enriched. Moreover, 88 miRNA-mRNA interaction pairs were identified through a combined analysis of the two datasets. We also found evidence showing that the virus-derived siRNAs (vsiRNAs) from the PVY genome target tobacco translationally controlled tumor protein (NtTCTP) mRNA and mediate plant resistance to PVY. Together, our findings revealed that both miRNA and mRNA expression patterns can be changed in response to PVY infection and novel vsiRNA-plant interactions that may regulate plant resistance to PVY. Both provide fresh insights into the virus-plant interactions.

Virus infection can trigger the changes of the cellular microRNA (miRNA) expression profile, which play important post-transcriptional regulatory roles in gene expression and can greatly influence viral replication and pathogenesis. Here, we employed deep sequencing technology to determine which cellular miRNAs were differentially expressed in primary sheep testicular (ST) cells infected with BTV. A total of 25 known miRNAs and 240 novel miRNA candidates that were differentially expressed in BTV-infected and uninfected ST cells were identified, and 251 and 8428 predicted target genes were annotated, respectively. Nine differentially expressed miRNAs and their mRNA targets were validated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Targets prediction and functional analysis of these regulated miRNAs revealed significant enrichment for several signaling pathways including MAPK, PI3K-Akt, endocytosis, Hippo, NF-kB, viral carcinogenesis, FoxO, and JAK-STAT signaling pathways. This study provides a valuable basis for further investigation on the roles of miRNAs in BTV replication and pathogenesis.

10.1016/j.compbiomed.2017.09.013  |  Robotics, Smart Healthcare  |  Robotics  |  Electromyogram pattern recognition (EMG-PR)  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Review  |   Electromyogram pattern recognition (EMG-PR) based control for upper-limb prostheses conventionally focuses on the classification of signals acquired in a controlled laboratory setting. In such a setting, relatively stable and high performances are often reported because subjects could consistently perform muscle contractions corresponding to a targeted limb motion. Meanwhile the clinical implementation of EMG-PR method is characterized by degradations in stability and classification performances due to the disparities between the constrained laboratory setting and clinical use. One of such disparities is the mobility of subject that would cause changes in the EMG signal patterns when eliciting identical limb motions in mobile scenarios. In this study, the effect of mobility on the performance of EMG-PR motion classifier was firstly investigated based on myoelectric and accelerometer signals acquired from six upper-limb amputees across four scenarios. Secondly, three methods were proposed to mitigate such effect on the EMG-PR motion classifier. From the obtained results, an average classification error (CE) of 9.50% (intra-scenario) was achieved when data from the same scenarios were used to train and test the EMG-PR classifier, while the CE increased to 18.48% (inter-scenario) when trained and tested with dataset from different scenarios. This implies that mobility would significantly lead to about 8.98% increase of classification error (p &lt; 0.05). By applying the proposed methods, the degradation in classification performance was significantly reduced from 8.98% to 1.86% (Dual-stage sequential method), 3.17% (Hybrid strategy), and 4.64% (Multi-scenario strategy). Hence, the proposed methods may potentially improve the clinical robustness of the currently available multifunctional prostheses.

10.3389/fnins.2017.00324  |  None  |  Robotics  |  mixed-signal neuromorphic hardware, eRBP  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   An ongoing challenge in neuromorphic computing is to devise general and computationally efficient models of inference and learning which are compatible with the spatial and temporal constraints of the brain. One increasingly popular and successful approach is to take inspiration from inference and learning algorithms used in deep neural networks. However, the workhorse of deep learning, the gradient descent Gradient Back Propagation (BP) rule, often relies on the immediate availability of network-wide information stored with high-precision memory during learning, and precise operations that are difficult to realize in neuromorphic hardware. Remarkably, recent work showed that exact backpropagated gradients are not essential for learning deep representations. Building on these results, we demonstrate an event-driven random BP (eRBP) rule that uses an error-modulated synaptic plasticity for learning deep representations. Using a two-compartment Leaky Integrate &amp; Fire (I&amp;F) neuron, the rule requires only one addition and two comparisons for each synaptic weight, making it very suitable for implementation in digital or mixed-signal neuromorphic hardware. Our results show that using eRBP, deep representations are rapidly learned, achieving classification accuracies on permutation invariant datasets comparable to those obtained in artificial neural network simulations on GPUs, while being robust to neural and synaptic state quantizations during learning.

The automatic segmentation of SR-µCT scans is highly valuable due to its innumerous applications in geological sciences, especially for morphology, typology, and characterization of rocks. For a great number of µCT scan slices, a manual process of segmentation would be impractical, either for the time expended and for the accuracy of results. Aiming the automatic segmentation of SR-µCT geological sample images, we applied and compared Energy Minimization via Graph Cuts (GC) algorithms and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), as well as the well-known K-means and Fuzzy C-Means algorithms. The Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Sensitivity and Precision were the metrics used for comparison. Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's tests were applied and the best methods were the GC algorithms and ANNs (with Levenberg-Marquardt and Bayesian Regularization). For those algorithms, an approximate Dice Similarity Coefficient of 95% was achieved. Our results confirm the possibility of usage of those algorithms for segmentation and posterior quantification of porosity of an igneous rock sample SR-µCT scan.

10.2196/resprot.8085  |  Smart Healthcare  |  None, Other  |  Adaptive E-Learning-Umgebungen (AEEs)  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Review  |    Background:  Adaptive e-learning environments (AEEs) can provide tailored instruction by adapting content, navigation, presentation, multimedia, and tools to each user's navigation behavior, individual objectives, knowledge, and preferences. AEEs can have various levels of complexity, ranging from systems using a simple adaptive functionality to systems using artificial intelligence. While AEEs are promising, their effectiveness for the education of health professionals and health professions students remains unclear. 
  Objective:  The purpose of this systematic review is to assess the effectiveness of AEEs in improving knowledge, competence, and behavior in health professionals and students. 
  Methods:  We will follow the Cochrane Collaboration and the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group guidelines on systematic review methodology. A systematic search of the literature will be conducted in 6 bibliographic databases (CINAHL, EMBASE, ERIC, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science) using the concepts "adaptive e-learning environments," "health professionals/students," and "effects on knowledge/skills/behavior." We will include randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials, in addition to controlled before-after, interrupted time series, and repeated measures studies published between 2005 and 2017. The title and the abstract of each study followed by a full-text assessment of potentially eligible studies will be independently screened by 2 review authors. Using the EPOC extraction form, 1 review author will conduct data extraction and a second author will validate the data extraction. The methodological quality of included studies will be independently assessed by 2 review authors using the EPOC risk of bias criteria. Included studies will be synthesized by a descriptive analysis. Where appropriate, data will be pooled using meta-analysis by applying the RevMan software version 5.1, considering the heterogeneity of studies. 
  Results:  The review is in progress. We plan to submit the results in the beginning of 2018. 
  Conclusion:  Providing tailored instruction to health professionals and students is a priority in order to optimize learning and clinical outcomes. This systematic review will synthesize the best available evidence regarding the effectiveness of AEEs in improving knowledge, competence, and behavior in health professionals and students. It will provide guidance to policy makers, hospital managers, and researchers in terms of AEE development, implementation, and evaluation in health care.

10.2196/jmir.6983  |  Smart Healthcare, Treatment  |  Treatment, Smart Healthcare  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Review  |    Background:  The daily commute could be a right moment to teach drivers to use movement or breath towards improving their mental health. Long commutes, the relevance of transitioning from home to work, and vice versa and the privacy of commuting by car make the commute an ideal scenario and time to perform mindful exercises safely. Whereas driving safety is paramount, mindful exercises might help commuters decrease their daily stress while staying alert. Increasing vehicle automation may present new opportunities but also new challenges. 
  Objective:  This study aimed to explore the design space for movement-based mindful interventions for commuters. We used qualitative analysis of simulated driving experiences in combination with simple movements to obtain key design insights. 
  Methods:  We performed a semistructured viability assessment in 2 parts. First, a think-aloud technique was used to obtain information about a driving task. Drivers (N=12) were given simple instructions to complete movements (configural or breath-based) while engaged in either simple (highway) or complex (city) simulated urban driving tasks using autonomous and manual driving modes. Then, we performed a matching exercise where participants could experience vibrotactile patterns from the back of the car seat and map them to the prior movements. 
  Results:  We report a summary of individual perceptions concerning different movements and vibrotactile patterns. Beside describing situations within a drive when it may be more likely to perform movement-based interventions, we also describe movements that may interfere with driving and those that may complement it well. Furthermore, we identify movements that could be conducive to a more relaxing commute and describe vibrotactile patterns that could guide such movements and exercises. We discuss implications for design such as the influence of driving modality on the adoption of movement, need for personal customization, the influence that social perception has on participants, and the potential role of prior awareness of mindful techniques in the adoption of new movement-based interventions. 
  Conclusions:  This exploratory study provides insights into which types of movements could be better suited to design mindful interventions to reduce stress for commuters, when to encourage such movements, and how best to guide them using noninvasive haptic stimuli embedded in the car seat.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.07.019  |  Diagnosis  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Population-level inferences and individual-level analyses are two important aspects in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. Extracting reliable and informative features from fMRI data that capture biologically meaningful inter-subject variation is critical for aligning and comparing functional networks across subjects, and connecting the properties of functional brain organization with variations in behavior, cognition and genetics. In this study, we derive two new measures, which we term functional density map and edge map, and demonstrate their usefulness in characterizing the function of individual brains. Specifically, using data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we show that (1) both functional maps capture intrinsic properties of the functional connectivity pattern in individuals while exhibiting large variation across subjects; (2) functional maps derived from either resting-state or task-evoked fMRI can be used to accurately identify subjects from a population; and (3) cross-subject alignment using these functional maps considerably reduces functional variation and improves functional correspondence across subjects over state-of-the-art multimodal registration algorithms. Our results suggest that the proposed functional density and edge maps are promising features in characterizing the functional architecture in individuals and provide an alternative way to explore the functional variation across subjects.

10.1371/journal.pone.0172290  |  Other  |  None, Other  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Knowledge about the arrangement of visual elements is an important aspect of perception. This study investigates whether humans learn rules of two-dimensional abstract patterns (exemplars) generated from Reber's artificial grammar. The key question is whether the subjects can implicitly learn them without explicit instructions, and, if so, how they use the acquired knowledge to judge new patterns (probes) in relation to their finite experience of the exemplars. The analysis was conducted using dissimilarities among patterns, which are defined with n-gram probabilities and the Levenshtein distance. The results show that subjects are able to learn rules of two-dimensional visual patterns (exemplars) and make categorical judgment of probes based on knowledge of exemplar-based representation. Our analysis revealed that subjects' judgments of probes were related to the degree of dissimilarities between the probes and exemplars. The result suggests the coexistence of configural and element-based processing in exemplar-based representations. Exemplar-based representation was preferred to prototypical representation through tasks requiring discrimination, recognition and working memory. Relations of the studied judgment processes to the neural basis are discussed. We conclude that knowledge of a finite experience of two-dimensional visual patterns would be crystalized in different levels of relations among visual elements.

Oxidative stress and adipokines are potential biomarkers in such pregnancies; thus, the measurement of these molecules has been considered critical. Therefore, we developed artificial neural network (ANN) models based on maternal weight status and clinical data to predict reliable maternal blood concentrations of these biomarkers at the end of pregnancy. Adipokines (adiponectin, leptin, and resistin), and DNA, lipid and protein oxidative markers (8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine, malondialdehyde and carbonylated proteins, respectively) were assessed in blood of normal weight, overweight and obese women in the third trimester of pregnancy. A Back-propagation algorithm was used to train ANN models with four input variables (age, pre-gestational body mass index (p-BMI), weight status and gestational age). ANN models were able to accurately predict all biomarkers with regression coefficients greater than R² = 0.945. P-BMI was the most significant variable for estimating adiponectin and carbonylated proteins concentrations (37%), while gestational age was the most relevant variable to predict resistin and malondialdehyde (34%). Age, gestational age and p-BMI had the same significance for leptin values. Finally, for 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine prediction, the most significant variable was age (37%). These models become relevant to improve clinical and nutrition interventions in prenatal care.

While also continuing as an independent field, computational neuroscience has combined with computational systems biology, and neural multiscale modeling arose as one offshoot. This consolidation has added electrical, graphical, dynamical system, learning theory, artificial intelligence and neural network viewpoints with the microscale of cellular biology (neuronal and glial), mesoscales of vascular, immunological and neuronal networks, on up to macroscales of cognition and behavior. The complexity of linkages that produces pathophysiology in neurological, neurosurgical and psychiatric disease will require multiscale modeling to provide understanding that exceeds what is possible with statistical analysis or highly simplified models: how to bring together pharmacotherapeutics with neurostimulation, how to personalize therapies, how to combine novel therapies with neurorehabilitation, how to interlace periodic diagnostic updates with frequent reevaluation of therapy, how to understand a physical disease that manifests as a disease of the mind. Multiscale modeling will also help to extend the usefulness of animal models of human diseases in neuroscience, where the disconnects between clinical and animal phenomenology are particularly pronounced. Here we cover areas of particular interest for clinical application of these new modeling neurotechnologies, including epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, ischemic disease, neurorehabilitation, drug addiction, schizophrenia and neurostimulation.

10.1002/jmri.25585  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis  |  single-shot gradient echo echo-planar imaging, image analysis  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Purpose:  To present a method for spatiotemporal alignment of in-utero magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) time series acquired during maternal hyperoxia for enabling improved quantitative tracking of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes that characterize oxygen transport through the placenta to fetal organs. 
  Materials and methods:  The proposed pipeline for spatiotemporal alignment of images acquired with a single-shot gradient echo echo-planar imaging includes 1) signal nonuniformity correction, 2) intravolume motion correction based on nonrigid registration, 3) correction of motion and nonrigid deformations across volumes, and 4) detection of the outlier volumes to be discarded from subsequent analysis. BOLD MRI time series collected from 10 pregnant women during 3T scans were analyzed using this pipeline. To assess pipeline performance, signal fluctuations between consecutive timepoints were examined. In addition, volume overlap and distance between manual region of interest (ROI) delineations in a subset of frames and the delineations obtained through propagation of the ROIs from the reference frame were used to quantify alignment accuracy. A previously demonstrated rigid registration approach was used for comparison. 
  Results:  The proposed pipeline improved anatomical alignment of placenta and fetal organs over the state-of-the-art rigid motion correction methods. In particular, unexpected temporal signal fluctuations during the first normoxia period were significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.01) and volume overlap and distance between region boundaries measures were significantly improved (P &lt; 0.01). 
  Conclusion:  The proposed approach to align MRI time series enables more accurate quantitative studies of placental function by improving spatiotemporal alignment across placenta and fetal organs.

Most existing methods require computation of the joint histogram of the images, while some perform joint segmentation and registration in alternate iterations. In this work, we introduce a new non-information-theoretical method for pairwise multimodal image registration, in which the error of segmentation - using both images - is considered as the registration cost function. We empirically evaluate our method via rigid registration of multi-contrast brain magnetic resonance images, and demonstrate an often higher registration accuracy in the results produced by the proposed technique, compared to those by several existing methods.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.04.028  |  Other  |  None, Other  |  intrinsic resting state fMRI signal correlation patterns  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Aligning brain structures across individuals is a central prerequisite for comparative neuroimaging studies. Typically, registration approaches assume a strong association between the features used for alignment, such as macro-anatomy, and the variable observed, such as functional activation or connectivity. Here, we propose to use the structure of intrinsic resting state fMRI signal correlation patterns as a basis for alignment of the cortex in functional studies. Rather than assuming the spatial correspondence of functional structures between subjects, we have identified locations with similar connectivity profiles across subjects. We mapped functional connectivity relationships within the brain into an embedding space, and aligned the resulting maps of multiple subjects. We then performed a diffeomorphic alignment of the cortical surfaces, driven by the corresponding features in the joint embedding space. Results show that functional alignment based on resting state fMRI identifies functionally homologous regions across individuals with higher accuracy than alignment based on the spatial correspondence of anatomy. Further, functional alignment enables measurement of the strength of the anatomo-functional link across the cortex, and reveals the uneven distribution of this link. Stronger anatomo-functional dissociation was found in higher association areas compared to primary sensory- and motor areas. Functional alignment based on resting state features improves group analysis of task based functional MRI data, increasing statistical power and improving the delineation of task-specific core regions. Finally, a comparison of the anatomo-functional dissociation between cohorts is demonstrated with a group of left and right handed subjects.

10.1186/s12984-016-0212-z  |  Robotics  |  Robotics  |  Bewegungsklassifizierungsmethode, Klassifizierung, LDA-Algorithmus, SFS-Algorithmus (Sequential Forward Selection)  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Review  |    Background:  Most of the modern motorized prostheses are controlled with the surface electromyography (sEMG) recorded on the residual muscles of amputated limbs. However, the residual muscles are usually limited, especially after above-elbow amputations, which would not provide enough sEMG for the control of prostheses with multiple degrees of freedom. Signal fusion is a possible approach to solve the problem of insufficient control commands, where some non-EMG signals are combined with sEMG signals to provide sufficient information for motion intension decoding. In this study, a motion-classification method that combines sEMG and electroencephalography (EEG) signals were proposed and investigated, in order to improve the control performance of upper-limb prostheses. 
  Methods:  Four transhumeral amputees without any form of neurological disease were recruited in the experiments. Five motion classes including hand-open, hand-close, wrist-pronation, wrist-supination, and no-movement were specified. During the motion performances, sEMG and EEG signals were simultaneously acquired from the skin surface and scalp of the amputees, respectively. The two types of signals were independently preprocessed and then combined as a parallel control input. Four time-domain features were extracted and fed into a classifier trained by the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) algorithm for motion recognition. In addition, channel selections were performed by using the Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) algorithm to optimize the performance of the proposed method. 
  Results:  The classification performance achieved by the fusion of sEMG and EEG signals was significantly better than that obtained by single signal source of either sEMG or EEG. An increment of more than 14% in classification accuracy was achieved when using a combination of 32-channel sEMG and 64-channel EEG. Furthermore, based on the SFS algorithm, two optimized electrode arrangements (10-channel sEMG + 10-channel EEG, 10-channel sEMG + 20-channel EEG) were obtained with classification accuracies of 84.2 and 87.0%, respectively, which were about 7.2 and 10% higher than the accuracy by using only 32-channel sEMG input. 
  Conclusions:  This study demonstrated the feasibility of fusing sEMG and EEG signals towards improving motion classification accuracy for above-elbow amputees, which might enhance the control performances of multifunctional myoelectric prostheses in clinical application. 
  Trial registration:  The study was approved by the ethics committee of Institutional Review Board of Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, and the reference number is SIAT-IRB-150515-H0077.

10.1063/1.4981938  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis  |  piezoelektrisches (PZT) Anregungssystem  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Nondestructive evaluation using shearography requires a way to stress the inspection target. This technique is able to directly measure the displacement gradient distribution on the object surface. Shearography visualizes the internal structural damages as the anomalous pattern in the shearograpic fringe pattern. A piezoelectric (PZT) excitation system is able to generate loadings in the vibrational, acoustic, and ultrasonic regimes. In this paper, we propose a PZT-excited stroboscopic shearography. The PZT excitation could generate vibrational loading, a stationary wavefield, and a nonstationary propagation wave to fulfill the external loading requirement of shearography. The sweeping of the PZT excitation frequency, the formation of a standing wave, and a small shearing to suppress the incident wave were powerful controllable tools to detect the defects. The sweeping of the PZT excitation frequency enabled us to determine one of the defect-sensitive frequencies almost in real time. In addition, because the defect sensitive frequencies always existed in wide and plural ranges, the risk of the defect being overlooked by the inspector could be alleviated. The results of evaluation using stroboscopic shearography showed that an artificial 20 mm-diameter defect could be visualized at the excitation frequencies of 5-8 kHz range and 12.5-15.5 kHz range. This technique provided full field reliable and repeatable inspection results. Additionally, the proposed method overcame the important drawback of the time-averaged shearography, being required to identify the resonance vibration frequency sensitive to the defect.

Here, we investigated the gene expression profiles of HBV-related LF patients. Whole genome expression arrays were used to detect gene expression in liver biopsy samples from chronically HBV infected patients. Through integrative data analysis, we identified several pathways and key genes involved in the initiation and exacerbation of liver fibrosis. Weight gene co-expression analysis revealed that integrin subunit ß-like 1 (ITGBL1) was a key regulator of fibrogenesis. Functional experiments demonstrated that ITGBL1 was an upstream regulator of LF via interactions with transforming growth factor ß1. In summary, we investigated the gene expression profiles of HBV-related LF patients and identified a key regulator ITGBL1. Our findings provide a foundation for future studies of gene functions and promote the development of novel antifibrotic therapies.

Early phases of DR are characterized by retinal pericyte loss mainly related to concurrent inflammatory process. Recently, an important link between P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) and inflammation has been demonstrated indicating this receptor as potential pharmacological target in DR. Here we first carried out an in silico molecular modeling study in order to characterize the allosteric pocket in P2X7R, and identify a suitable P2X7R antagonist through molecular docking. JNJ47965567 was identified as the hit compound in docking calculations, as well as for its absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) profile. As an in vitro model of early diabetic retinopathy, human retinal pericytes were exposed to high glucose (25mM, 48h) that caused a significant (p&lt;0.05) release of IL-1ß and LDH. The block of P2X7R by JNJ47965567 significantly (p&lt;0.05) reverted the damage elicited by high glucose, detected as IL-1ß and LDH release. Overall, our findings suggest that the P2X7R represents an attractive pharmacological target to manage the early phase of diabetic retinopathy, and the compound JNJ47965567 is a good template to discover other P2X7R selective antagonists.

Here we argue that such representations are encoded by stable spatio-temporal patterns of firing within cell assemblies known as polychronous groups, or PGs. We develop a physiologically grounded, unsupervised spiking neural network model of the auditory brain with local, biologically realistic, spike-time dependent plasticity (STDP) learning, and show that the plastic cortical layers of the network develop PGs which convey substantially more information about the speaker independent identity of two naturally spoken word stimuli than does rate encoding that ignores the precise spike timings. We furthermore demonstrate that such informative PGs can only develop if the input spatio-temporal spike patterns to the plastic cortical areas of the model are relatively stable.

Not surprisingly, identifying drugs and compounds that extend lifespan in model organisms is a growing research area. Here, we present DrugAge (http://genomics.senescence.info/drugs/), a curated database of lifespan-extending drugs and compounds. At the time of writing, DrugAge contains 1316 entries featuring 418 different compounds from studies across 27 model organisms, including worms, flies, yeast and mice. Data were manually curated from 324 publications. Using drug-gene interaction data, we also performed a functional enrichment analysis of targets of lifespan-extending drugs. Enriched terms include various functional categories related to glutathione and antioxidant activity, ion transport and metabolic processes. In addition, we found a modest but significant overlap between targets of lifespan-extending drugs and known aging-related genes, suggesting that some but not most aging-related pathways have been targeted pharmacologically in longevity studies. DrugAge is freely available online for the scientific community and will be an important resource for biogerontologists.

10.1111/his.13333  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Treatment  |  AI  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Aims:  Evaluating expression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) by visual examination of immunohistochemistry (IHC) on invasive breast cancer (BCa) is a key part of the diagnostic assessment of BCa due to its recognized importance as a predictive and prognostic marker in clinical practice. However, visual scoring of HER2 is subjective, and consequently prone to interobserver variability. Given the prognostic and therapeutic implications of HER2 scoring, a more objective method is required. In this paper, we report on a recent automated HER2 scoring contest, held in conjunction with the annual PathSoc meeting held in Nottingham in June 2016, aimed at systematically comparing and advancing the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI)-based automated methods for HER2 scoring. 
  Methods and results:  The contest data set comprised digitized whole slide images (WSI) of sections from 86 cases of invasive breast carcinoma stained with both haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and IHC for HER2. The contesting algorithms predicted scores of the IHC slides automatically for an unseen subset of the data set and the predicted scores were compared with the 'ground truth' (a consensus score from at least two experts). We also report on a simple 'Man versus Machine' contest for the scoring of HER2 and show that the automated methods could beat the pathology experts on this contest data set. 
  Conclusions:  This paper presents a benchmark for comparing the performance of automated algorithms for scoring of HER2. It also demonstrates the enormous potential of automated algorithms in assisting the pathologist with objective IHC scoring.

AI is generally accepted as having started with the invention of robots. The term derives from the Czech word robota, meaning biosynthetic machines used as forced labor. In this field, Leonardo Da Vinci's lasting heritage is today's burgeoning use of robotic-assisted surgery, named after him, for complex urologic and gynecologic procedures. Da Vinci's sketchbooks of robots helped set the stage for this innovation. AI, described as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, was officially born in 1956. The term is applicable to a broad range of items in medicine such as robotics, medical diagnosis, medical statistics, and human biology-up to and including today's "omics". AI in medicine, which is the focus of this review, has two main branches: virtual and physical. The virtual branch includes informatics approaches from deep learning information management to control of health management systems, including electronic health records, and active guidance of physicians in their treatment decisions. The physical branch is best represented by robots used to assist the elderly patient or the attending surgeon. Also embodied in this branch are targeted nanorobots, a unique new drug delivery system. The societal and ethical complexities of these applications require further reflection, proof of their medical utility, economic value, and development of interdisciplinary strategies for their wider application.

To reduce the cost and simplify the evaluation, inertial sensors and adaptive algorithms have been utilized, respectively. This paper aims to summarize studies that applied adaptive also called artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to gait analysis based on inertial sensor data, verifying if they can support the clinical evaluation. Articles were identified through searches of the main databases, which were encompassed from 1968 to October 2016. We have identified 22 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The included papers were analyzed due to their data acquisition and processing methods with specific questionnaires. Concerning the data acquisition, the mean score is 6.1±1.62, what implies that 13 of 22 papers failed to report relevant outcomes. The quality assessment of AI algorithms presents an above-average rating (8.2±1.84). Therefore, AI algorithms seem to be able to support gait analysis based on inertial sensor data. Further research, however, is necessary to enhance and standardize the application in patients, since most of the studies used distinct methods to evaluate healthy subjects.

One of the most recent examples is the lack of phase III trials demonstrating the superiority of intensity-modulated radiation therapy in most of its current indications. A new paradigm is developing that consists in the mining of large databases to answer clinical or translational issues. Beyond national databases (such as SEER or NCDB), that often lack the necessary level of details on the population studied or the treatments performed, electronic health records can be used to create detailed phenotypic profiles of any patients. In parallel, the Record-and-Verify Systems used in radiation oncology precisely document the planned and performed treatments. Artificial Intelligence and machine learning algorithms can be used to incrementally analyse these data in order to generate hypothesis to better personalize treatments. This review discusses how these methods have already been used in previous studies.

Efforts to improve screening outcomes have mostly focused on intensifying imaging practices (double instead of single-reading, more frequent screens, or supplemental imaging) that may add substantial resource expenditures and harms associated with population screening. Less attention has been given to making mammography screening practice 'smarter' or more efficient. Artificial intelligence (AI) is capable of advanced learning using large complex datasets and has the potential to perform tasks such as image interpretation. With both highly-specific capabilities, and also possible un-intended (and poorly understood) consequences, this viewpoint considers the promise and current reality of AI in BC detection.

10.1080/17453674.2017.1344459  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis  |  deep learning  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Review  |   Background and purpose - Recent advances in artificial intelligence (deep learning) have shown remarkable performance in classifying non-medical images, and the technology is believed to be the next technological revolution. So far it has never been applied in an orthopedic setting, and in this study we sought to determine the feasibility of using deep learning for skeletal radiographs. Methods - We extracted 256,000 wrist, hand, and ankle radiographs from Danderyd's Hospital and identified 4 classes: fracture, laterality, body part, and exam view. We then selected 5 openly available deep learning networks that were adapted for these images. The most accurate network was benchmarked against a gold standard for fractures. We furthermore compared the network's performance with 2 senior orthopedic surgeons who reviewed images at the same resolution as the network. Results - All networks exhibited an accuracy of at least 90% when identifying laterality, body part, and exam view. The final accuracy for fractures was estimated at 83% for the best performing network. The network performed similarly to senior orthopedic surgeons when presented with images at the same resolution as the network. The 2 reviewer Cohen's kappa under these conditions was 0.76. Interpretation - This study supports the use for orthopedic radiographs of artificial intelligence, which can perform at a human level. While current implementation lacks important features that surgeons require, e.g. risk of dislocation, classifications, measurements, and combining multiple exam views, these problems have technical solutions that are waiting to be implemented for orthopedics.

10.1161/STROKEAHA.116.016281  |  Treatment, Smart Healthcare  |  Diagnosis, Treatment, Smart Healthcare  |  AI  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background and purpose:  This study evaluated the use of an artificial intelligence platform on mobile devices in measuring and increasing medication adherence in stroke patients on anticoagulation therapy. The introduction of direct oral anticoagulants, while reducing the need for monitoring, have also placed pressure on patients to self-manage. Suboptimal adherence goes undetected as routine laboratory tests are not reliable indicators of adherence, placing patients at increased risk of stroke and bleeding. 
  Methods:  A randomized, parallel-group, 12-week study was conducted in adults (n=28) with recently diagnosed ischemic stroke receiving any anticoagulation. Patients were randomized to daily monitoring by the artificial intelligence platform (intervention) or to no daily monitoring (control). The artificial intelligence application visually identified the patient, the medication, and the confirmed ingestion. Adherence was measured by pill counts and plasma sampling in both groups. 
  Results:  For all patients (n=28), mean (SD) age was 57 years (13.2 years) and 53.6% were women. Mean (SD) cumulative adherence based on the artificial intelligence platform was 90.5% (7.5%). Plasma drug concentration levels indicated that adherence was 100% (15 of 15) and 50% (6 of 12) in the intervention and control groups, respectively. 
  Conclusions:  Patients, some with little experience using a smartphone, successfully used the technology and demonstrated a 50% improvement in adherence based on plasma drug concentration levels. For patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants, absolute improvement increased to 67%. Real-time monitoring has the potential to increase adherence and change behavior, particularly in patients on direct oral anticoagulant therapy.

Through the data interpretation methods made available by the recent AI tools, researchers and AI companies have focused on the development of models allowing to predict the risk of suffering from a specific disease, to make a diagnosis, and to recommend a treatment that is based on the best and most updated scientific evidence. Even if AI is used to perform unimaginable tasks until a few years ago, the awareness about the ongoing revolution has not yet spread through the medical community for several reasons including the lack of evidence about safety, reliability and effectiveness of these tools, the lack of regulation accompanying hospitals in the use of AI by health care providers, the difficult attribution of liability in case of errors and malfunctions of these systems, and the ethical and privacy questions that they raise and that, as of today, are still unanswered.

AI techniques have been applied in cardiovascular medicine to explore novel genotypes and phenotypes in existing diseases, improve the quality of patient care, enable cost-effectiveness, and reduce readmission and mortality rates. Over the past decade, several machine-learning techniques have been used for cardiovascular disease diagnosis and prediction. Each problem requires some degree of understanding of the problem, in terms of cardiovascular medicine and statistics, to apply the optimal machine-learning algorithm. In the near future, AI will result in a paradigm shift toward precision cardiovascular medicine. The potential of AI in cardiovascular medicine is tremendous; however, ignorance of the challenges may overshadow its potential clinical impact. This paper gives a glimpse of AI's application in cardiovascular clinical care and discusses its potential role in facilitating precision cardiovascular medicine.

Traditional multiple criteria group decision making (MCGDM) approaches to ERSE have been facing simultaneous challenging characteristics of decision hesitancy and prioritization relations among assessing criteria, due to the complexity in practical ERSE problems. Therefore, aiming at the special type of ERSE problems that hold the two characteristics, we investigate effective MCGDM approaches by hiring interval-valued dual hesitant fuzzy set (IVDHFS) to comprehensively depict decision hesitancy. To exploit decision information embedded in prioritization relations among criteria, we firstly define an fuzzy entropy measure for IVDHFS so that its derivative decision models can avoid potential information distortion in models based on classic IVDHFS distance measures with subjective supplementing mechanism; further, based on defined entropy measure, we develop two fundamental prioritized operators for IVDHFS by extending Yager's prioritized operators. Furthermore, on the strength of above methods, we construct two hesitant fuzzy MCGDM approaches to tackle complex scenarios with or without known weights for decision makers, respectively. Finally, case studies have been conducted to show effectiveness and practicality of our proposed approaches.

This type of system is based on a deep neural network (DNN) trained to discriminate between phonetic units, i.e. trained for the task of automatic speech recognition (ASR). This DNN aims to compress information in one of its layers, known as bottleneck (BN) layer, which is used to obtain a new frame representation of the audio signal. This representation has been proven to be useful for the task of language identification (LID). Thus, bottleneck features are used as input to the language recognition system, instead of a classical parameterization of the signal based on cepstral feature vectors such as MFCCs (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients). Despite the success of this approach in language recognition, there is a lack of studies analyzing in a systematic way how the topology of the DNN influences the performance of bottleneck feature-based language recognition systems. In this work, we try to fill-in this gap, analyzing language recognition results with different topologies for the DNN used to extract the bottleneck features, comparing them and against a reference system based on a more classical cepstral representation of the input signal with a total variability model. This way, we obtain useful knowledge about how the DNN configuration influences bottleneck feature-based language recognition systems performance.

The observation by an ophthalmologist usually conducted by analyzing the retinal images of the patient which are marked by some DR features. However some misdiagnosis are usually found due to human error. Here, a deep learning-based low-cost embedded system is established to assist the doctor for grading the severity of the DR from the retinal images. A compact deep learning algorithm named Deep-DR-Net which fits on a small embedded board is afterwards proposed for such purposes. In the heart of Deep-DR-Net, a cascaded encoder-classifier network is arranged using residual style for ensuring the small model size. The usage of different types of convolutional layers subsequently guarantees the features richness of the network for differentiating the grade of the DR. Experimental results show the capability of the proposed system for detecting the existence as well as grading the severity of the DR symptomps.

However, existing designs have stiff actuating mechanism, heavy and bulky electromagnetic or pneumatic actuators. This paper introduces ankle rehabilitation robot that utilizes Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wire actuator to provide foot plantarflexion and dorsiflexion during rehabilitation exercise. SMA wire is a smart material that can contract when it is heated and expand back to its original shape when it is cooled. It also has high power to weight ratio. However, the SMA wire has low cooling rate thus limits its operating frequency. A periodical cooling mechanism is proposed here. Its efficacy is then evaluated against natural cooling and continuous forced convection. The experimental study shows promising results and demonstrates that periodical cooling has both the advantages of natural cooling and forced convection and can improve the cooling rate of SMA wire actuator.

The system employs independent component analysis (ICA) with scalp map back projection to select the dominant of EEG channels. After channel selection, the features of the selected EEG channels were extracted based on power spectral density (PSD), and then classified using a Bayesian neural network. The results of the ICA decomposition with the back-projected scalp map and a threshold showed that the EEG channels can be reduced from 32 channels into 16 dominants channels involved in fatigue assessment as chosen channels, which included AF3, F3, FC1, FC5, T7, CP5, P3, O1, P4, P8, CP6, T8, FC2, F8, AF4, FP2. The result of fatigue vs. alert classification of the selected 16 channels yielded a sensitivity of 76.8%, specificity of 74.3% and an accuracy of 75.5%. Also, the classification results of the selected 16 channels are comparable to those using the original 32 channels. So, the selected 16 channels is preferable for ergonomics improvement of EEG-based fatigue classification system.

This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of artificial intelligence models for 5-year overall survival prediction in patients with cervical cancer treated by radical hysterectomy. 
  Methods:  The data set was collected from 102 patients with cervical cancer FIGO stage IA2-IIB, that underwent primary surgical treatment. Twenty-three demographic, tumor-related parameters and selected perioperative data of each patient were collected. The simulations involved six computational intelligence methods: the probabilistic neural network (PNN), multilayer perceptron network, gene expression programming classifier, support vector machines algorithm, radial basis function neural network and k-Means algorithm. The prediction ability of the models was determined based on the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, as well as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The results of the computational intelligence methods were compared with the results of linear regression analysis as a reference model. 
  Results:  The best results were obtained by the PNN model. This neural network provided very high prediction ability with an accuracy of 0.892 and sensitivity of 0.975. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of PNN was also high, 0.818. The outcomes obtained by other classifiers were markedly worse. 
  Conclusions:  The PNN model is an effective tool for predicting 5-year overall survival in cervical cancer patients treated with radical hysterectomy.

Deep learning has made a breakthrough in the applications of image and speech recognitions, and also has been extensively used in the fields of face recognition and information retrieval because of its special superiority. Bone X-ray images express different variations in black-white-gray gradations, which have image features of black and white contrasts and level differences. Based on these advantages of deep learning in image recognition, we combine it with the research of bone age assessment to provide basic datum for constructing a forensic automatic system of bone age assessment. This paper reviews the basic concept and network architectures of deep learning, and describes its recent research progress on image recognition in different research fields at home and abroad, and explores its advantages and application prospects in bone age assessment.

In this study, we propose a strategy with a cross-sectional analysis to evaluate the meditation experience with 2 artificial intelligence techniques: artificial neural network and support vector machine. Within this analysis system, 3 features of the electroencephalography alpha spectrum and variant normalizing scaling are manipulated as the evaluating variables for the detection of accuracy. Thereafter, by modulating the sliding window (the period of the analyzed data) and shifting interval of the window (the time interval to shift the analyzed data), the effect of immediate analysis for the 2 methods is compared. This analysis system is performed on 3 meditation groups, categorizing their meditation experiences in 10-year intervals from novice to junior and to senior. After an exhausted calculation and cross-validation across all variables, the high accuracy rate &gt;98% is achievable under the criterion of 0.5-minute sliding window and 2 seconds shifting interval for both methods. In a word, the minimum analyzable data length is 0.5 minute and the minimum recognizable temporal resolution is 2 seconds in the decision of meditative classification. Our proposed classifier of the meditation experience promotes a rapid evaluation system to distinguish meditation experience and a beneficial utilization of artificial techniques for the big-data analysis.

However, it is unclear whether deep learning could occur in the real brain. Here, we show that a deep learning algorithm that utilizes multi-compartment neurons might help us to understand how the neocortex optimizes cost functions. Like neocortical pyramidal neurons, neurons in our model receive sensory information and higher-order feedback in electrotonically segregated compartments. Thanks to this segregation, neurons in different layers of the network can coordinate synaptic weight updates. As a result, the network learns to categorize images better than a single layer network. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm takes advantage of multilayer architectures to identify useful higher-order representations-the hallmark of deep learning. This work demonstrates that deep learning can be achieved using segregated dendritic compartments, which may help to explain the morphology of neocortical pyramidal neurons.

The discourse of robotics often constructs robots that are like us (and therefore unlike dumb artefacts). In the discourse of STS, descriptions of how people assimilate robots into their activities are presented directly or indirectly against the backdrop of actor-network theory, which prompts attributing agency to mundane artefacts. In contradistinction to both social robotics and STS, it is suggested here that to view a capacity to partake in dialogical action (to have a 'voice') is necessary for regarding an artefact as authentically social. The theme is explored partly through a critical reinterpretation of an episode that Morana Alac reported and analysed towards demonstrating her bodies-in-interaction concept. This paper turns to 'body' with particular reference to Gibsonian affordances theory so as to identify the level of analysis at which dialogicality enters social interactions.

Ontologies describe and classify the entities of interest in a scientific domain in a computationally accessible fashion such that algorithms and tools can be developed around them. The technology that underlies ontologies has its roots in logic-based artificial intelligence, allowing for sophisticated automated inference and error detection. This chapter presents a general introduction to modern computational ontologies as they are used in biology.

10.1016/S0151-9638(17)31064-5  |  Treatment, Epidemiology, Drug Discovery, Diagnosis  |  Prognosis, Treatment, Epidemiology  |  deep learning, AI  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Research  |   This 'What's new in oncodermatology?' addresses the developments in 2017 on the epidemiology and management of skin cancers. We observe a constant increase in carcinomas, risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma, especially in transplant recipients where skin cancer mortality is important. Among epidemiological developments in melanoma are increased mortality despite screening, occupational exposure to UV, second melanoma and higher risk after carcinoma. New classifications that should be considered are AJCC8 for melanoma and carcinoma. In a near future artificial intelligence could change skin cancer screening practices through deep learning. For the sentinel lymph node, there is no interest in systematic lymphadenectomy that does not improve survival. Radiation therapy is essential for the prognosis of Merkel's carcinoma, and Mohs' surgery can be of interest. In metastatic melanoma, results on immunotherapy and targeted treatments include duration, dose, combinations, and the study of resistance mechanisms. The great novelty is immunotherapy or targeted therapy as an adjuvant treatment, giving an improvement in survival without relapse.

10.1017/S0963180116001158  |  None  |  Drug Discovery  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Within the literature surrounding nonhuman animals on the one hand and cognitively disabled humans on the other, there is much discussion of where beings that do not satisfy the criteria for personhood fit in our moral deliberations. In the future, we may face a different but related problem: that we might create (or cause the creation of) beings that not only satisfy but exceed these criteria. The question becomes whether these are minimal criteria, or hierarchical, such that those who fulfill them to greater degree should be afforded greater consideration. This article questions the validity and necessity of drawing divisions among beings that satisfy the minimum requirements for personhood; considering how future beings-intelligent androids, synthezoids, even alternate-substrate sentiences-might fit alongside the "baseline" human. I ask whether these alternate beings ought to be considered different to us, and why this may or may not matter in terms of a notion of "human community." The film Blade Runner, concerned in large part with humanity and its key synthezoid antagonist Roy Batty, forms a framing touchstone for my discussion. Batty is stronger, faster, more resilient, and more intelligent than Homo sapiens. His exploits, far beyond the capability of normal humans, are contrasted with his frailty and transient lifespan, his aesthetic appreciation of the sights he has seen, and his burgeoning empathy. Not for nothing does his creator within the mythos term him "more human than human."

10.1073/pnas.1619788114  |  None  |  Prognosis  |  feedforward drive, feedback drive, deep neural network  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Most models of sensory processing in the brain have a feedforward architecture in which each stage comprises simple linear filtering operations and nonlinearities. Models of this form have been used to explain a wide range of neurophysiological and psychophysical data, and many recent successes in artificial intelligence (with deep convolutional neural nets) are based on this architecture. However, neocortex is not a feedforward architecture. This paper proposes a first step toward an alternative computational framework in which neural activity in each brain area depends on a combination of feedforward drive (bottom-up from the previous processing stage), feedback drive (top-down context from the next stage), and prior drive (expectation). The relative contributions of feedforward drive, feedback drive, and prior drive are controlled by a handful of state parameters, which I hypothesize correspond to neuromodulators and oscillatory activity. In some states, neural responses are dominated by the feedforward drive and the theory is identical to a conventional feedforward model, thereby preserving all of the desirable features of those models. In other states, the theory is a generative model that constructs a sensory representation from an abstract representation, like memory recall. In still other states, the theory combines prior expectation with sensory input, explores different possible perceptual interpretations of ambiguous sensory inputs, and predicts forward in time. The theory, therefore, offers an empirically testable framework for understanding how the cortex accomplishes inference, exploration, and prediction.

10.1089/end.2016.0791  |  Treatment, Diagnosis, Prognosis  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Smart Healthcare  |  artificial neural network  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Purpose:  To construct, train, and apply an artificial neural network (ANN) system for prediction of different outcome variables of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). We calculated predictive accuracy, sensitivity, and precision for each outcome variable. 
  Methods:  During the study period, all adult patients who underwent PCNL at our institute were enrolled in the study. Preoperative and postoperative variables were recorded, and stone-free status was assessed perioperatively with computed tomography scans. MATLAB software was used to design and train the network in a feed forward back-propagation error adjustment scheme. Preoperative and postoperative data from 200 patients (training set) were used to analyze the effect and relative relevance of preoperative values on postoperative parameters. The validated adequately trained ANN was used to predict postoperative outcomes in the subsequent 254 adult patients (test set) whose preoperative values were serially fed into the system. To evaluate system accuracy in predicting each postoperative variable, predicted values were compared with actual outcomes. 
  Results:  Two hundred fifty-four patients (155 [61%] males) were considered the test set. Mean stone burden was 6702.86 ± 381.6 mm<sup>3</sup>. Overall stone-free rate was 76.4%. Fifty-four out of 254 patients (21.3%) required ancillary procedures (shockwave lithotripsy 5.9%, transureteral lithotripsy 10.6%, and repeat PCNL 4.7%). The accuracy and sensitivity of the system in predicting different postoperative variables ranged from 81.0% to 98.2%. 
  Conclusion:  As a complex nonlinear mathematical model, our ANN system is an interconnected data mining tool, which prospectively analyzes and "learns" the relationships between variables. The accuracy and sensitivity of the system for predicting the stone-free rate, the need for blood transfusion, and post-PCNL ancillary procedures ranged from 81.0% to 98.2%.The stone burden and the stone morphometry were among the most significant preoperative characteristics that affected all postoperative outcome variables and they received the highest relative weight by the ANN system.

This process is time-consuming and often a major bottleneck in the evaluation pipeline. To overcome this problem, we have introduced the Trainable Weka Segmentation (TWS), a machine learning tool that leverages a limited number of manual annotations in order to train a classifier and segment the remaining data automatically. In addition, TWS can provide unsupervised segmentation learning schemes (clustering) and can be customized to employ user-designed image features or classifiers.

10.1007/s10916-017-0760-1  |  Smart Healthcare  |  Treatment, Smart Healthcare  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Review  |   The aim of this review is to investigate barriers and challenges of wearable patient monitoring (WPM) solutions adopted by clinicians in acute, as well as in community, care settings. Currently, healthcare providers are coping with ever-growing healthcare challenges including an ageing population, chronic diseases, the cost of hospitalization, and the risk of medical errors. WPM systems are a potential solution for addressing some of these challenges by enabling advanced sensors, wearable technology, and secure and effective communication platforms between the clinicians and patients. A total of 791 articles were screened and 20 were selected for this review. The most common publication venue was conference proceedings (13, 54%). This review only considered recent studies published between 2015 and 2017. The identified studies involved chronic conditions (6, 30%), rehabilitation (7, 35%), cardiovascular diseases (4, 20%), falls (2, 10%) and mental health (1, 5%). Most studies focussed on the system aspects of WPM solutions including advanced sensors, wireless data collection, communication platform and clinical usability based on a specific area or disease. The current studies are progressing with localized sensor-software integration to solve a specific use-case/health area using non-scalable and 'silo' solutions. There is further work required regarding interoperability and clinical acceptance challenges. The advancement of wearable technology and possibilities of using machine learning and artificial intelligence in healthcare is a concept that has been investigated by many studies. We believe future patient monitoring and medical treatments will build upon efficient and affordable solutions of wearable technology.

RUDO, the designed system, comprises several modules that mainly support or ensure recognition of approaching people, alerting to other household members' movement in the flat, work on a computer, supervision of (sighted) children, cooperation of a sighted and a blind person (e.g., when studying), control of heating and zonal regulation by a blind person. It has a unified user interface that gives the blind person access to individual functions. The interface for blind people offers assistance with work on a computer, including writing in Braille on a regular keyboard and specialized work in informatics and electronics (e.g., programming). RUDO can complement the standard aids used by blind people at home, it increases their independence and creates conditions that allow them to become fully involved. RUDO also supports blind people sharing a home with sighted people, which contributes to their feeling of security and greater inclusion in society. RUDO has been implemented in a household for two years, which allows an evaluation of its use in practice.

To minimize the device size and integrate it with wearable electronics, there is an urgent requirement of realizing the functional integration of generating and detecting sound in a single device. Here we show an intelligent laser-induced graphene artificial throat, which can not only generate sound but also detect sound in a single device. More importantly, the intelligent artificial throat will significantly assist for the disabled, because the simple throat vibrations such as hum, cough and scream with different intensity or frequency from a mute person can be detected and converted into controllable sounds. Furthermore, the laser-induced graphene artificial throat has the advantage of one-step fabrication, high efficiency, excellent flexibility and low cost, and it will open practical applications in voice control, wearable electronics and many other areas.

10.1016/j.taap.2017.03.011  |  Drug Discovery  |  Prognosis  |  AI  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Many studies of nanomaterials make non-systematic alterations of nanoparticle physicochemical properties. Given the immense size of the property space for nanomaterials, such approaches are not very useful in elucidating fundamental relationships between inherent physicochemical properties of these materials and their interactions with, and effects on, biological systems. Data driven artificial intelligence methods such as machine learning algorithms have proven highly effective in generating models with good predictivity and some degree of interpretability. They can provide a viable method of reducing or eliminating animal testing. However, careful experimental design with the modelling of the results in mind is a proven and efficient way of exploring large materials spaces. This approach, coupled with high speed automated experimental synthesis and characterization technologies now appearing, is the fastest route to developing models that regulatory bodies may find useful. We advocate greatly increased focus on systematic modification of physicochemical properties of nanoparticles combined with comprehensive biological evaluation and computational analysis. This is essential to obtain better mechanistic understanding of nano-bio interactions, and to derive quantitatively predictive and robust models for the properties of nanomaterials that have useful domains of applicability.

In our recent work, we demonstrated a proof-of-concept of implementing deep generative adversarial autoencoder (AAE) to identify new molecular fingerprints with predefined anticancer properties. Another popular generative model is the variational autoencoder (VAE), which is based on deep neural architectures. In this work, we developed an advanced AAE model for molecular feature extraction problems, and demonstrated its advantages compared to VAE in terms of (a) adjustability in generating molecular fingerprints; (b) capacity of processing very large molecular data sets; and (c) efficiency in unsupervised pretraining for regression model. Our results suggest that the proposed AAE model significantly enhances the capacity and efficiency of development of the new molecules with specific anticancer properties using the deep generative models.

It is vital to have in-depth understanding of the material properties and governing parameters of its processes in response to different formulations. Understanding the mentioned aspects will allow tighter control of the process, leading to implementation of quality-by-design (QbD) practices. Computational intelligence (CI) offers an opportunity to create empirical models that can be used to describe the system and predict future outcomes in silico. CI models can help explore the behavior of input parameters, unlocking deeper understanding of the system. This research endeavor presents CI models to predict the porosity of tablets created by roll-compacted binary mixtures, which were milled and compacted under systematically varying conditions. CI models were created using tree-based methods, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and symbolic regression trained on an experimental data set and screened using root-mean-square error (RMSE) scores. The experimental data were composed of proportion of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) (in percentage), granule size fraction (in micrometers), and die compaction force (in kilonewtons) as inputs and porosity as an output. The resulting models show impressive generalization ability, with ANNs (normalized root-mean-square error [NRMSE] =1%) and symbolic regression (NRMSE =4%) as the best-performing methods, also exhibiting reliable predictive behavior when presented with a challenging external validation data set (best achieved symbolic regression: NRMSE =3%). Symbolic regression demonstrates the transition from the black box modeling paradigm to more transparent predictive models. Predictive performance and feature selection behavior of CI models hints at the most important variables within this factor space.

In the medical imaging domain, example tasks include organ segmentation, lesion detection, and tumor classification. The most popular network architecture for deep learning for images is the convolutional neural network (CNN). Whereas traditional machine learning requires determination and calculation of features from which the algorithm learns, deep learning approaches learn the important features as well as the proper weighting of those features to make predictions for new data. In this paper, we will describe some of the libraries and tools that are available to aid in the construction and efficient execution of deep learning as applied to medical images.

Until now neural networks have not been capable of this and it has been widely thought that catastrophic forgetting is an inevitable feature of connectionist models. We show that it is possible to overcome this limitation and train networks that can maintain expertise on tasks that they have not experienced for a long time. Our approach remembers old tasks by selectively slowing down learning on the weights important for those tasks. We demonstrate our approach is scalable and effective by solving a set of classification tasks based on a hand-written digit dataset and by learning several Atari 2600 games sequentially.

10.1016/j.conb.2017.07.010  |  Robotics  |  Robotics  |  AI  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Research  |   Artificial intelligence such as deep neural networks exhibited remarkable performance in simulated video games and 'Go'. In contrast, most humanoid robots in the DARPA Robotics Challenge fell down to ground. The dramatic contrast in performance is mainly due to differences in the amount of training data, which is huge and small, respectively. Animals are not allowed with millions of the failed trials, which lead to injury and death. Humans fall only several thousand times before they balance and walk. We hypothesize that a unique closed-loop neural circuit formed by the Purkinje cells, the cerebellar deep nucleus and the inferior olive in and around the cerebellum and the highest density of gap junctions, which regulate synchronous activities of the inferior olive nucleus, are computational machinery for learning from a small sample. We discuss recent experimental and computational advances associated with this hypothesis.

To study blueberry phenolic biosynthesis, we investigated phenolics and proteomics at three typical fruit maturation phases. Multiple isoforms of enzymes and multiple members of transcription factors involved in phenolic biosynthesis were divergent and differently regulated. Regulation of some proteins resulted in change of phenolic content. During fruit maturation, down-regulation of VcOMT (CUFF.177.1) and VcLAR2 (CUFF.16780.1) was associated with decreases of ferulic acid and catechin, respectively; Up-regulation of VcFLS (CUFF.41155.1), and VcF3'5'H (CUFF.51711.1) and VcF3'5'H (gene.g10884.t1.1) likely drove increases of their products (quercetin and myricetin); Up-regulation of VcUFGALT (CUFF.20951.1) and VcUFGT73 (4333_g.1) and down-regulation of VcU5GT (CUFF.51258.1) were correlated to accumulation of anthocyanins with 3-glucoside/galactoside. Additionally, four TFs, VcAPRR2 (CUFF.24826.1), VcbHLH3 (CUFF.37765.1), VcWD (CUFF.28282.2) and VcWD (CUFF.28273.1) were probably related to regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis. These proteins were potential targets for genetic improvement in a breeding program.

Similarly, the use of orbital angular momentum of light as a new degree of freedom for information processing can further improve the bandwidth of optical communications. However, due to the lack of orbital angular momentum selectivity in the design of conventional holograms, their utilization as an information carrier for holography has never been implemented. Here we demonstrate metasurface orbital angular momentum holography by utilizing strong orbital angular momentum selectivity offered by meta-holograms consisting of GaN nanopillars with discrete spatial frequency distributions. The reported orbital angular momentum-multiplexing allows lensless reconstruction of a range of distinctive orbital angular momentum-dependent holographic images. The results pave the way to the realization of ultrahigh-capacity holographic devices harnessing the previously inaccessible orbital angular momentum multiplexing.

The effects of structural parameters on the extinction spectrum and refractive index (RI) sensitivity are analyzed to obtain optimal parameters.

After coating a methane-sensitive membrane on the inner and outer surfaces of the gold rings, the methane concentration can be accurately measured with a gas sensitivity of -1.02 nm/%. The proposed method is also applicable to quantitative analyses of components concentration and qualitative analyses of gas composition.

10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.087  |  Genetics  |  Diagnosis  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   In aquatic ecosystems, both phytoplankton and bacteria play pivotal roles. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, considerable research focused on phytoplankton colony attached and free-living bacteria has revealed the close relationship between them, and indicated that the entire bacterial community mediates crucial biogeochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems. However, our understanding of their distribution patterns and response to environmental factors remains poor. Besides, picocyanobacteria, which were omitted from attached bacteria analysis, were reported to be important in cyanobacterial blooms. To explore the spatiotemporal variation of the entire bacterial community with their driving environmental factors and detect the relationships among them, we collected 61 water samples spanning one year and the entire Lake Taihu regions for surveying the entire bacterial community. Our results indicated: 1) seasonal variation of the bacterial community composition was stronger than spatial variation due to the clearly seasonal variation of Microcystis, Synechococcus (pico-cyanobacteria) and other bacteria (Actinomycetales, Pirellulaceae and Sphingobacteriaceae); 2) the spatial distribution of the bacterial community showed that different phyla were dominant in different regions; 3) the bacterial co-occurrence networks varied seasonally and were dominated by Microcystis, ACK-M1, Chthoniobacteraceae, Synechococcus, Pirellulaceae and Pelagibacteraceae; 4) phytoplankton density, chlorophyll a, water temperature and total nitrogen were the major factors that drove the spatiotemporal variation of bacterial community composition. This study revealed the seasonal succession and spatial distribution of the entire bacterial community in Lake Taihu, providing new insights into the relationship between water bloom-forming cyanobacterial species and other bacteria, and their response to environmental factors in eutrophic freshwater ecosystem.

Recent studies have demonstrated that long non-coding RNA and micro RNA can interact through various mechanisms to regulate mRNA. Yet the gene-gene interaction has not been investigated in coronary heart disease (CHD). 
  Methods:  High throughput sequencing were used to identify differentially expressed (DE) lncRNA, miRNA, and mRNA profiles between CHD and healthy control. Gene Oncology (GO), KEGG enrichment analysis were performed. Gene-gene interaction network were constructed and pivotal genes were screened out. Lentivirus-induced shRNA infection and qRT-PCR were performed to validated the gene-gene interactions. 
  Results:  A total of 62 lncRNAs, 332 miRNAs and 366 mRNAs were differentially expressed between CHD and healthy control. GO and KEGG analysis show that immune related molecular mechanisms and biological processes play a role in CHD. The gene-gene interaction network were constructed and visualized based on Pearson correlation coefficients and starBase database. 6 miRNAs in the network were significantly correlated to left ventricular ejection fraction, total choleterol and homocysteine. 2 lncRNAs (CTA-384D8.35 and CTB-114C7.4 (refseq entry LOC100128059)), 1 miRNA (miR-4497), and 1 mRNA (NR4A1) were the pivotal genes. Lentivirus-induced shRNA infection and qRT-PCR had validated the pivotal gene-gene interactions. 
  Conclusions:  These results have shown the potential of lncRNA, miRNA, and mRNA as clinical biomarkers and in elucidating pathological mechanisms of CHD from a transcriptomic perspective.

ANN simulates neuron learning procedures and it could provide good diagnostic performances in this complex and heterogeneous disease compared with linear regression analysis. 
  Design and methods:  In our study, a new set of lipid peroxidation compounds were determined in urine and plasma samples from patients diagnosed with early Alzheimer Disease (n = 70) and healthy controls (n = 26) by means of ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass-spectrometry. Then, a model based on ANN was developed to classify groups of participants. 
  Results:  The diagnostic performances obtained using an ANN model for each biological matrix were compared with the corresponding linear regression model based on partial least squares (PLS), and with the non-linear (radial and polynomial) support vector machine (SVM) models. Better accuracy, in terms of receiver operating characteristic-area under curve (ROC-AUC), was obtained for the ANN models (ROC-AUC 0.882 in plasma and 0.839 in urine) than for PLS and SVM models. 
  Conclusion:  Lipid peroxidation and ANN constitute a useful approach to establish a reliable diagnosis when the prognosis is complex, multidimensional and non-linear.

10.1371/journal.pone.0220106  |  Prognosis, Epidemiology  |  Prognosis, Epidemiology  |  Machine Learning  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Local climate conditions play a major role in the biology of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the main vector responsible for transmitting dengue, zika, chikungunya and yellow fever in urban centers. For this reason, a detailed assessment of periods in which changes in climate conditions affect the number of human cases may improve the timing of vector-control efforts. In this work, we develop new machine-learning algorithms to analyze climate time series and their connection to the occurrence of dengue epidemic years for seven Brazilian state capitals. Our method explores the impact of two key variables-frequency of precipitation and average temperature-during a wide range of time windows in the annual cycle. Our results indicate that each Brazilian state capital considered has its own climate signatures that correlate with the overall number of human dengue-cases. However, for most of the studied cities, the winter preceding an epidemic year shows a strong predictive power. Understanding such climate contributions to the vector's biology could lead to more accurate prediction models and early warning systems.

10.3390/s19132848  |  Smart Healthcare  |  Diagnosis  |  Incremental Principal Component Analysis  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   The counting of vehicles plays an important role in measuring the behavior patterns of traffic flow in cities, as streets and avenues can get crowded easily. To address this problem, some Intelligent Transport Systems (ITSs) have been implemented in order to count vehicles with already established video surveillance infrastructure. With this in mind, in this paper, we present an on-line learning methodology for counting vehicles in video sequences based on Incremental Principal Component Analysis (Incremental PCA). This incremental learning method allows us to identify the maximum variability (i.e., motion detection) between a previous block of frames and the actual one by using only the first projected eigenvector. Once the projected image is obtained, we apply dynamic thresholding to perform image binarization. Then, a series of post-processing steps are applied to enhance the binary image containing the objects in motion. Finally, we count the number of vehicles by implementing a virtual detection line in each of the road lanes. These lines determine the instants where the vehicles pass completely through them. Results show that our proposed methodology is able to count vehicles with 96.6% accuracy at 26 frames per second on average-dealing with both camera jitter and sudden illumination changes caused by the environment and the camera auto exposure.

The performance of approaches for daily activity recognition is therefore crucial, but current real-time approaches have to wait until a daily activity ends before performing recognition. We present an approach for timely daily activity recognition from an incomplete stream of sensor events, by which the recognition process can start as soon as a daily activity begins. Activity features are generated from several headmost sensor events rather than from all sensor events that a daily activity activated. A public dataset was utilized to evaluate the presented method. Experimental findings show its effectiveness for timely daily activity recognition in terms of precision, recall, average saved time, and saved time proportion.

The method finds out interesting parts of the video by discarding the remaining parts of the video. The abstracts thus generated enhances browsing and retrieval of video data. The quality of summaries generated by video summarization algorithms can be improved if the redundant frames in the input video are taken care of before summarization. This paper presents a novel domain-independent method for redundancy elimination from input videos before summarization maintaining keyframes in the original video. The frames of input video are first presampled by selecting two frames in one second. The flow vectors between consecutive frames are computed using SIFT Flow algorithm. The magnitude of flow vectors at each pixel position of the frame are summed up to find the displacement magnitude between the consecutive frames. The redundant frames are filtered out based on local averaging of the displacement values. The evaluation of the method is done using two standard datasets namely VSUMM and OVP. The results demonstrate that an average reduction rate of 97.64% is achieved consistently on videos of all categories. The method also gives superior results compared to other state-of-the-art redundancy elimination methods for video summarization.

10.3390/s19245499  |  Smart Healthcare  |  Treatment  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   A gait event is a crucial step towards the effective assessment and rehabilitation of motor dysfunctions. However, for the data acquisition of a three-dimensional motion capture (3D Mo-Cap) system, the high cost of setups, such as the high standard laboratory environment, limits widespread clinical application. Inertial sensors are increasingly being used to recognize and classify physical activities in a variety of applications. Inertial sensors are now sufficiently small in size and light in weight to be part of a body sensor network for the collection of human gait data. The acceleration signal has found important applications in human gait recognition. In this paper, using the experimental data from the heel and toe, first the wavelet method was used to remove noise from the acceleration signal, then, based on the threshold of comprehensive change rate of the acceleration signal, the signal was primarily segmented. Subsequently, the vertical acceleration signals, from heel and toe, were integrated twice, to compute their respective vertical displacement. Four gait events were determined in the segmented signal, based on the characteristics of the vertical displacement of heel and toe. The results indicated that the gait events were consistent with the synchronous record of the motion capture system. The method has achieved gait event subdivision, while it has also ensured the accuracy of the defined gait events. The work acts as a valuable reference, to further study gait recognition.

Furthermore, interactions among the glomerular, tubular, and interstitial cells contribute to the process by excessive synthesis and decreased degradation of extracellular matrix. The morphology of kidney is different from pathological stages of diseases and changes with various causes. At the end stage of the disease, the kidneys are symmetrically contracted with diffuse granules. Most glomeruli show diffuse fibrosis and hyaline degeneration, and intervening tubules become atrophied. Renal interstitium shows obvious hyperplasia of fibrous tissues with marked infiltration of lymphocytes, mononuclear cells, and plasma cells. The renal arterioles are wall thickening frequently because of hyaline degeneration. Morphologic analysis based on Masson staining of the kidney tissues has been regarded as the golden standard to evaluate the visual fibrosis. However, the present studies have found that the evaluation system has poor repeatability. Several computer-aided image analysis techniques have been used to assess interstitial fibrosis. It is possible that the evaluation of renal fibrosis is carried out by the artificial intelligence renal biopsy pathological diagnosis system in the near future.

It includes digital intraoral radiography, digital panoramic radiography, digital cephalography, and cone-beam computed tomography. In this study, we focused on the methods to assess image quality of these techniques, except for digital cephalography, in the light of historical issues. We stressed on the importance of the development of a standardized phantom and quantitative analysis of diagnostic image quality using it, especially in the aspect of psychophysical properties of these digital systems. There is no missing link in the image quality assessment in digital intraoral radiography and cone-beam computed tomography in dental use. However, there are missing links between physical and diagnostic image qualities in panoramic radiography. The development of a semi-standardized phantom and the corresponding quantitative analysis method for image quality may be required in digital panoramic radiography. Quantitative image quality assessment using a standardized phantom will also be promising in the future artificial intelligence era.

10.34133/2019/1608396  |  Robotics  |  Robotics  |  Artificial Intelligence  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Concepts from mathematical crystallography and group theory are used here to quantize the group of rigid-body motions, resulting in a "motion alphabet" with which robot motion primitives are expressed. From these primitives it is possible to develop a dictionary of physical actions. Equipped with an alphabet of the sort developed here, intelligent actions of robots in the world can be approximated with finite sequences of characters, thereby forming the foundation of a language in which robot motion is articulated. In particular, we use the discrete handedness-preserving symmetries of macromolecular crystals (known in mathematical crystallography as Sohncke space groups) to form a coarse discretization of the space SE(3) of rigid-body motions. This discretization is made finer by subdividing using the concept of double-coset decomposition. More specifically, a very efficient, equivolumetric quantization of spatial motion can be defined using the group-theoretic concept of a double-coset decomposition of the form Γ\SE(3)/Δ, where Γ is a Sohncke space group and Δ is a finite group of rotational symmetries such as those of the icosahedron. The resulting discrete alphabet is based on a very uniform sampling of SE(3) and is a tool for describing the continuous trajectories of robots and humans. An efficient coarse-to-fine search algorithm is presented to round off any motion sampled from the continuous group of motions to the nearest element of our alphabet. It is shown that our alphabet and this efficient rounding algorithm can be used as a geometric data structure to accelerate the performance of other sampling schemes designed for desirable dispersion or discrepancy properties. Moreover, the general "signals to symbols" problem in artificial intelligence is cast in this framework for robots moving continuously in the world.

10.1186/s12874-019-0708-x  |  Prognosis  |  Prognosis, Treatment  |  Gradient Boosting Model  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Chronic respiratory symptoms involving bronchitis, cough and phlegm in children are underappreciated but pose a significant public health burden. Efforts for prevention and management could be supported by an understanding of the relative importance of determinants, including environmental exposures. Thus, we aim to develop a prediction model for bronchitic symptoms. 
  Methods:  Schoolchildren from the population-based southern California Children's Health Study were visited annually from 2003 to 2012. Bronchitic symptoms over the prior 12 months were assessed by questionnaire. A gradient boosting model was fit using groups of risk factors (including traffic/air pollution exposures) for all children and by asthma status. Training data consisted of one observation per participant in a random study year (for 50% of participants). Validation data consisted of: (1) a random (later) year in the same participants (within-participant); (2) a random year in participants excluded from the training data (across-participant). 
  Results:  At baseline, 13.2% of children had asthma and 18.1% reported bronchitic symptoms. Models performed similarly within- and across-participant. Previous year symptoms/medication use provided much of the predictive ability (across-participant area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC): 0.76 vs 0.78 for all risk factors, in all participants). Traffic/air pollution exposures added modestly to prediction as did body mass index percentile, age and parent stress. 
  Conclusions:  Regardless of asthma status, previous symptoms were the most important predictors of current symptoms. Traffic/air pollution variables contribute modest predictive information, but impact large populations. Methods proposed here could be generalized to personalized exacerbation predictions in future longitudinal studies to support targeted prevention efforts.

Using experimental fitness data and implementing artificial intelligence and a computational mutagenesis technique, we developed models that reliably predict fitness for all single residue mutants of H-<i>ras</i> proto-oncogene protein p21. The computational mutagenesis generated a feature vector of protein structural changes for each variant, and these data correlated well with fitness. Random forest classification and tree regression machine learning algorithms were implemented for training predictive models. Cross-validations were used to evaluate model performance, and control experiments were performed to assess statistical significance. Classification models revealed a balanced accuracy rate as high as 82%, with a Matthew's correlation of 0.63, and an area under ROC curve of 0.90. Similarly, regression models displayed Pearson's correlation reaching 0.79. On the other hand, control data sets led to performance values consistent with random guessing. Comparisons with several related state-of-the-art methods reflected favorably on our trained models. This H-Ras proof-of-principle study suggests a complementary approach for understanding mechanisms with which other proteins are involved in oncogenesis, including related Ras isoforms, and for providing useful insights into designing future diagnostic and treatment modalities.

We assessed histological clot composition in a series of patients with large vessel occlusion and investigated correlations between clot composition and stroke pathogenesis. Methods- As part of the multi-institutional STRIP registry (Stroke Thromboembolism Registry of Imaging and Pathology), consecutive emboli retrieved during mechanical thrombectomy were stained using Martius Scarlett Blue and analyzed using machine learning software. We assessed proportions of red blood cells, fibrin, platelets, and white blood cells. Correlations between clot components and stroke pathogenesis (large artery atherosclerosis, cardioembolism, and stroke of undetermined pathogenesis) were assessed using SPSS22. Results- One hundred five patients were included. The proportion of platelet-rich clots (55.0% versus 21.2%; P=0.005) and percentage of platelet content (22.1±4.2% versus 13.9±14.2%; P=0.03) was significantly higher in the large artery atherosclerosis group compared with the cardioembolic group. The proportion of platelet-rich clots (50.0% versus 21.2%; P=0.024) was also significantly higher in the cryptogenic group compared with cardioembolic cases. Large artery atherosclerosis and cryptogenic cases had a similar proportion of platelet-rich clots (55.0% versus 50.0%; P=0.636). There was no significant difference between stroke pathogenesis and the other major clot components. Conclusions- High platelet content of emboli is associated with a large artery atherosclerosis etiology of large vessel occlusion.

Whole genome sequencing of clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates promises to circumvent the long wait times and limited scope of conventional phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility, but gaps remain for predicting phenotype accurately from genotypic data especially for certain drugs. Our primary aim was to perform an exploration of statistical learning algorithms and genetic predictor sets using a rich dataset to build a high performing and fast predicting model to detect anti-tuberculosis drug resistance. 
  Methods:  We collected targeted or whole genome sequencing and conventional drug resistance phenotyping data from 3601 Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains enriched for resistance to first- and second-line drugs, with 1228 multidrug resistant strains. We investigated the utility of (1) rare variants and variants known to be determinants of resistance for at least one drug and (2) machine and statistical learning architectures in predicting phenotypic drug resistance to 10 anti-tuberculosis drugs. Specifically, we investigated multitask and single task wide and deep neural networks, a multilayer perceptron, regularized logistic regression, and random forest classifiers. 
  Findings:  The highest performing machine and statistical learning methods included both rare variants and those known to be causal of resistance for at least one drug. Both simpler L2 penalized regression and complex machine learning models had high predictive performance. The average AUCs for our highest performing model was 0.979 for first-line drugs and 0.936 for second-line drugs during repeated cross-validation. On an independent validation set, the highest performing model showed average AUCs, sensitivities, and specificities, respectively, of 0.937, 87.9%, and 92.7% for first-line drugs and 0.891, 82.0% and 90.1% for second-line drugs. Our method outperforms existing approaches based on direct association, with increased sum of sensitivity and specificity of 11.7% on first line drugs and 3.2% on second line drugs. Our method has higher predictive performance compared to previously reported machine learning models during cross-validation, with higher AUCs for 8 of 10 drugs. 
  Interpretation:  Statistical models, especially those that are trained using both frequent and less frequent variants, significantly improve the accuracy of resistance prediction and hold promise in bringing sequencing technologies closer to the bedside.

In the present study, we divided 120 common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) into two groups including control group and CPF group, CPF group was exposed to 14.5 μg/L CPF for 30 d. 17 miRNAs were differentially expressed in CPF group head kidney tissues according to the results of miRNAome analysis. In addition, histopathological examination and electron microscopy proved that CPF exposure could lead to damage of head kidney and obvious apoptosis characteristics. The possible target genes of miRNA were predicted using online target gene prediction websites, miRNAome sequencing, GO and KEGG enrichment. miRNAome results showed that expression of miR-731 and miR-2188-3p in CPF group was 0.48 time and 0.45 time as control group, respectively. qRT-PCR results proved the reality of miRNAome. During CPF exposure, mRNA expression of TLR pathway genes and its downstream genes involved in autophagy and apoptosis pathway including TLR1, TLR2, TLR7, TLR9, MyD88, IRAK1, IRAK4, IRF7, PI3K, AKT, mTOR, Caspase3, Caspase8 and Bax were differentially increased under CPF exposure, along with ATG13 and Bcl2 decreased at the same time. Western blot results indicated that apoptosis related protein Caspase3 and Caspase8 were differentially up-regulated in the CPF group. In summary, CPF exposure could induce apoptosis while inhibited autophagy in head kidney of common carp via the regulation of miR-2188-3p and miR-731 by targeting TLR pathway. These results provide new insights for unveiling the biological effects of CPF and miRNAs in common carp.

10.1002/art.41056  |  Treatment, Prognosis, Genetics  |  Prognosis, Treatment, Genetics  |  Gaussian Process Regression Model  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Objective:  Accurate prediction of treatment responses in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients can provide valuable information on effective drug selection. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) drugs are an important second-line treatment after methotrexate, the classic first-line treatment for RA. However, patient heterogeneity hinders identification of predictive biomarkers and accurate modeling of anti-TNF drug responses. This study was undertaken to investigate the usefulness of machine learning to assist in developing predictive models for treatment response. 
  Methods:  Using data on patient demographics, baseline disease assessment, treatment, and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array from the Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods (DREAM): Rheumatoid Arthritis Responder Challenge, we created a Gaussian process regression model to predict changes in the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) for the patients and to classify them into either the responder or the nonresponder group. This model was developed and cross-validated using data from 1,892 RA patients. It was evaluated using an independent data set from 680 patients. We examined the effectiveness of the similarity modeling and the contribution of individual features. 
  Results:  In the cross-validation tests, our method predicted changes in DAS28 (ΔDAS28), with a correlation coefficient of 0.405. It correctly classified responses from 78% of patients. In the independent test, this method achieved a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.393 in predicting ΔDAS28. Gaussian process regression effectively remapped the feature space and identified subpopulations that do not respond well to anti-TNF treatments. Genetic SNP biomarkers showed small contributions in the prediction when added to the clinical models. This was the best-performing model in the DREAM Challenge. 
  Conclusion:  The model described here shows promise in guiding treatment decisions in clinical practice, based primarily on clinical profiles with additional genetic information.

Hsp90 inhibitors induce cell death in various cancers, including CRC. However, the underlying mechanisms need to be clarified further. In this study, Caco-2 cells were treated with 0.25 μM SNX-2112, an Hsp90 inhibitor, for 48 h; subsequently, whole-transcriptome sequencing was performed. At the mRNA level in SNX-2112-treated Caco-2 cells, 1588 genes were upregulated, and 433 genes were downregulated. Six genes were found to be associated with necroptosis and apoptosis, and these 6 upregulated genes were validated by RT-qPCR. Hundred and six miRNAs were upregulated, and 48 miRNAs were downregulated in SNX-2112-treated Caco-2 cells. Eleven downregulated miRNAs were found to interact with the 6 upregulated genes. Moreover, 676 circRNAs were upregulated, and 291 circRNAs were downregulated in SNX-2112-treated Caco-2 cells. Among them, 126 circRNAs were found to be the target of the 11 downregulated miRNAs. The circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network of Hsp90 inhibitor-induced cell death in colorectal cancer was constructed. This regulatory network extends the underlying mechanism of Hsp90 and improves our understanding of Hsp90 inhibitors as potential targeted therapeutic agents.

Such data have the potential for rapid, reproducible and highly discriminative characterization of pathogens. This provides an opportunity in microbial risk assessment to account for variations in survivability and virulence among strains. A major challenge towards such attempts remains the highly dimensional nature of genomic data versus the number of isolates. Machine learning-based (ML) predictive risk modelling provides a solution to this "curse of dimensionality" while accounting for individual effects that are dependent on interactions with other genetic and environmental factors. This pilot study explores the potential of ML in the prediction of health endpoints resulting from shigatoxigenic E. coli (STEC) infection. Accessory genes in amino acid sequences were used as model input to predict and differentiate health outcomes in STEC infections including diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, hemolytic uremic syndrome and their combinations. Outcomes severity was also distinguished by hospitalization. A matrix of percent similarity between accessory genes and the E. coli genomes was generated and subsequently used as input for ML. The performances of ML algorithms random forest, support vector machine (radial and linear kernel), gradient boosting, and logit boost were compared. Logit boost was the best model showing an outcome prediction accuracy of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.60, 0.86), an excellent or substantial performance (Kappa = 0.72). Important genetic predictors of riskier STEC clinical outcomes included proteins involved in initial attachment to the host cell, persistence of plasmids or genomic islands, conjugative plasmid transfer and formation of sex pili, regulation of locus of enterocyte effacement expression, post-translational acetylation of proteins, facilitation of the rearrangement or deletion of sections within the pathogenic islands and transport macromolecules across the cell envelope. We propose further studies are proposed on the proteins with undefined or unclear functionality. One protein family in particular predicted HUS outcome. Toxin-antitoxin systems are potential stress adaptation markers which may mediate environmental persistence of strains in diverse sources. We foresee the application of ML approach to the set-up of real-time online analysis of whole genome sequence data to estimate the human health risk at the population or strain level. The ML approach is envisaged to support the prediction of more specific STEC clinical endpoints type by inputting isolate sequence data.

Despite the favourable in silico and in vitro outcomes, in vivo assessment of clomipramine, which metabolizes to desmethylclomipramine, failed to demonstrate favourable effects on motor and memory tests. In fact, clomipramine treatment worsened the composite neuroscore (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Weight loss (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and prolonged upregulation of plasma cytokines (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) may have contributed to the worsened somatomotor outcome. Our pipeline provides a rational stepwise procedure for evaluating favourable and unfavourable effects of systems-biology discovered compounds that modulate post-TBI transcriptomics.

10.2196/12996  |  Smart Healthcare  |  Diagnosis, Smart Healthcare  |  Artificial Intelligence  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Review  |    Background:  Individuals living with long-term physical health conditions frequently experience co-occurring mental health problems. This comorbidity has a significant impact on an individual's levels of emotional distress, health outcomes, and associated health care utilization. As health care services struggle to meet demand and care increasingly moves to the community, digital tools are being promoted to support patients to self-manage their health. One such technology is the autonomous virtual agent (chatbot, conversational agent), which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to process the user's written or spoken natural language and then to select or construct the corresponding appropriate responses. 
  Objective:  This study aimed to co-design the content, functionality, and interface modalities of an autonomous virtual agent to support self-management for patients with an exemplar long-term condition (LTC; chronic pulmonary obstructive disease [COPD]) and then to assess the acceptability and system content. 
  Methods:  We conducted 2 co-design workshops and a proof-of-concept implementation of an autonomous virtual agent with natural language processing capabilities. This implementation formed the basis for video-based scenario testing of acceptability with adults with a diagnosis of COPD and health professionals involved in their care. 
  Results:  Adults (n=6) with a diagnosis of COPD and health professionals (n=5) specified 4 priority self-management scenarios for which they would like to receive support: at the time of diagnosis (information provision), during acute exacerbations (crisis support), during periods of low mood (emotional support), and for general self-management (motivation). From the scenario testing, 12 additional adults with COPD felt the system to be both acceptable and engaging, particularly with regard to internet-of-things capabilities. They felt the system would be particularly useful for individuals living alone. 
  Conclusions:  Patients did not explicitly separate mental and physical health needs, although the content they developed for the virtual agent had a clear psychological approach. Supported self-management delivered via an autonomous virtual agent was acceptable to the participants. A co-design process has allowed the research team to identify key design principles, content, and functionality to underpin an autonomous agent for delivering self-management support to older adults living with COPD and potentially other LTCs.

10.1371/journal.pone.0226039  |  Genetics  |  Genetics  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Review  |   The fat body, a multifunctional organ analogous to the liver and fat tissue of vertebrates, plays an important role in insect life cycles. The fat body is involved in protein storage, energy metabolism, elimination of xenobiotics, and production of immunity regulator-like proteins. However, the molecular mechanism of the fat body's physiological functions in the tephritid stem gall-forming fly, Procecidochares utilis, are still unknown. In this study, we performed transcriptome analysis of the fat body of P. utilis using Illumina sequencing technology. In total, 3.71 G of clean reads were obtained and assembled into 30,559 unigenes, with an average length of 539 bp. Among those unigenes, 21,439 (70.16%) were annotated based on sequence similarity to proteins in NCBI's non-redundant protein sequence database (Nr). Sequences were also compared to NCBI's non-redundant nucleotide sequence database (Nt), a manually curated and reviewed protein sequence database (SwissProt), and KEGG and gene ontology annotations were applied to better understand the functions of these unigenes. A comparative analysis was performed to identify unigenes related to detoxification, immunity and energy metabolism. Many unigenes involved in detoxification were identified, including 50 unigenes of putative cytochrome P450s (P450s), 18 of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), 35 of carboxylesterases (CarEs) and 26 of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Many unigenes related to immunity were identified, including 17 putative serpin genes, five peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) and four lysozyme genes. In addition, unigenes potentially involved in energy metabolism, including 18 lipase genes, five fatty acid synthase (FAS) genes and six elongases of very long chain fatty acid (ELOVL) genes, were identified. This transcriptome improves our genetic understanding of P. utilis and the identification of a numerous transcripts in the fat body of P. utilis offer a series of valuable molecular resources for future studies on the functions of these genes.

10.3892/mmr.2018.9677  |  Prognosis, Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Genetics  |  Molecular Complex Detection Algorithm  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   The present study aimed to identify potential novel biomarkers in synovial tissue obtained from patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Osteoarthritis (OA) for differential diagnosis. The genome‑wide expression profiling datasets of synovial tissues from RA and OA cohorts, including GSE55235, GSE55457 and GSE55584 datasets, were retrieved and used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs; P&lt;0.05; false discovery rate &lt;0.05 and Fold Change &gt;2) between RA and OA using R software. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses of DEGs were performed to determine molecular and biochemical pathways associated with the identified DEGs, and a protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network of the DEGs was constructed using Cytoscape software. Significant modules in the PPI network and candidate driver genes were screened using the Molecular Complex Detection Algorithm. Potential biomarkers were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic and logistic regression analyses. Large numbers of DEGs were detected, including 273, 205 and 179 DEGs in the GSE55235, GSE55457 and GSE55584 datasets, respectively. Among them, 80 DEGs exhibited identical expression trends in all the three datasets, including 49 upregulated and 31 downregulated genes in patients with RA. DEGs in patients suffering from RA compared with patients suffering from OA were predominantly associated with the primary immunodeficiency pathway, including interleukin 7 receptor (IL7R) and signal transducer activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). The sensitivity of IL7R + STAT1 to differentiate RA from OA was 93.94% with a specificity of 80.77%. The results generated from analyses of the GSE36700 dataset were closely associated with results generated from analyses of GSE55235, GSE55457 and GSE55584 datasets, which further verified the reliability of the aforementioned results. The results of the present study suggested that increased expression of IL7R and STAT1 in synovial tissue as well as in the primary immunodeficiency may be associated with RA occurrence. These identified novel biomarkers may be used to predict disease occurrence and clinically differentiate RA from OA.

The adherens junction (AJ) connects the actomyosin networks of neighboring cardiomyocytes and is required for proper heart function. Yet little is known about the molecular composition of the cardiomyocyte AJ or how it is organized to function under mechanical load. Here, we define the architecture, dynamics and proteome of the cardiomyocyte AJ. Mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes assemble stable AJs along intercellular contacts with organizational and structural hallmarks similar to mature contacts. We combine quantitative mass spectrometry with proximity labeling to identify the N-cadherin (CDH2) interactome. We define over 350 proteins in this interactome, nearly 200 of which are unique to CDH2 and not part of the E-cadherin (CDH1) interactome. CDH2-specific interactors comprise primarily adaptor and adhesion proteins that promote junction specialization. Our results provide novel insight into the cardiomyocyte AJ and offer a proteomic atlas for defining the molecular complexes that regulate cardiomyocyte intercellular adhesion. This article has an associated First Person interview with the first authors of the paper.

Hypoxia microenvironment cannot be ignored in the process of metastasis. Hypoxia inducible factor-1<i>α</i> (HIF-1<i>α</i>) is the core component of the hypoxia signaling pathway. The aim of this study was to identify potential hub genes and signaling pathways associated with HIF-1<i>α</i>. We explored the invasiveness- and metastasis-associated phenotype of GC via bioinformatics analysis and molecular studies. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in GC cells and HIF-1<i>α</i>-knockdown GC cells. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. Hub genes were identified via centrality analysis and Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) module analysis. The findings suggested that prolyl 4-hydroxylase beta polypeptide (<i>P4HB</i>) has strong associations with HIF-1<i>α</i>. Further, we observed that HIF-1<i>α</i> and <i>P4HB</i> were upregulated in SGC-7901 and BGC-823 cells. In addition, inhibition of HIF-1<i>α</i> expression reduced invasion and metastasis in GC cells; this effect was partially reversed by <i>P4HB</i> overexpression. Our results confirm that <i>P4HB</i> plays a significant role in the regulatory network of HIF-1<i>α</i>. Therefore, HIF-1<i>α</i> and <i>P4HB</i> may be considered potential biomarkers of GC.

10.3390/ijms20030553  |  Diagnosis, Genetics, Treatment  |  Diagnosis, Treatment, Genetics  |  Bioinformatic Methods  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Review  |   Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic airway inflammatory diseases that share some common features, although these diseases are somewhat different in etiologies, clinical features, and treatment policies. The aim of this study is to investigate the common microRNA-mediated changes in bronchial epithelial cells of asthma and COPD. The microRNA profiles in primary bronchial epithelial cells from asthma (AHBE) and COPD (CHBE) patients and healthy subjects (NHBE) were analyzed with next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the significant microRNA changes common in AHBE and CHBE were extracted. The upregulation of hsa-miR-10a-5p and hsa-miR-146a-5p in both AHBE and CHBE was confirmed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Using bioinformatic methods, we further identified putative targets of these microRNAs, which were downregulated in both AHBE and CHBE: miR-10a-5p might suppress <i>BCL2</i>, <i>FGFR3</i>, <i>FOXO3</i>, <i>PDE4A</i>, <i>PDE4C,</i> and <i>PDE7A</i>; miR-146a-5p might suppress <i>BCL2</i>, <i>INSR</i>, <i>PDE4D</i>, <i>PDE7A</i>, <i>PDE7B</i>, and <i>PDE11A</i>. We further validated significantly decreased expression levels of <i>FOXO3</i> and <i>PDE7A</i> in AHBE and CHBE than in NHBE with qPCR. Increased serum miR-146a-5p level was also noted in patients with asthma and COPD as compared with normal control subjects. In summary, our study revealed possible mechanisms mediated by miR-10a-5p and miR-146a-5p in the pathogenesis of both asthma and COPD. The findings might provide a scientific basis for developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

10.1371/journal.pone.0211908  |  Genetics  |  Diagnosis, Genetics  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Three artificially selected duck populations (AS), higher lean meat ratios (LTPD), higher fat ratios (FTPD) and higher quality meat (CMD), have been developed in China, providing excellent populations for investigation of artificial selection effects. However, the genetic signatures of artificial selection are unclear. In this study, we sequenced the genome sequences of these three artificially selected populations and their ancestral population (mallard, M). We then compared the genome sequences between AS and M and between LTPD and FTPD using integrated strategies such as anchoring scaffolds to pseudo-chromosomes, mutation detection, selective screening, GO analysis, qRT-PCR, and protein multiple sequences alignment to uncover genetic signatures of selection. We anchored duck scaffolds to pseudo-chromosomes and obtained 28 pseudo-chromosomes, accounting for 84% of duck genome in length. Totally 78 and 99 genes were found to be under selection between AS and M and between LTPD and FTPD. Genes under selection between AS and M mainly involved in pigmentation and heart rates, while genes under selection between LTPD and FTPD involved in muscle development and fat deposition. A heart rate regulator (HCN1), the strongest selected gene between AS and M, harbored a GC deletion in AS and displayed higher mRNA expression level in M than in AS. IGF2R, a regulator of skeletal muscle mass, was found to be under selection between FTPD and LTPD. We also found two nonsynonymous substitutions in IGF2R, which might lead to higher IGF2R mRNA expression level in FTPD than LTPD, indicating the two nonsynonymous substitutions might play a key role for the regulation of duck skeletal muscle mass. Taken together, these results of this study provide valuable insight for the genetic basis of duck artificial selection.

Plasmodium spp. parasites that cause malaria contain an essential, non-photosynthetic plastid-the apicoplast-which originated from a secondary (eukaryote-eukaryote) endosymbiosis. To discover organellar pathways with evolutionary and biomedical significance, we performed a mutagenesis screen for essential genes required for apicoplast biogenesis in Plasmodium falciparum. Apicoplast(-) mutants were isolated using a chemical rescue that permits conditional disruption of the apicoplast and a new fluorescent reporter for organelle loss. Five candidate genes were validated (out of 12 identified), including a triosephosphate isomerase (TIM)-barrel protein that likely derived from a core metabolic enzyme but evolved a new activity. Our results demonstrate, to our knowledge, the first forward genetic screen to assign essential cellular functions to unannotated P. falciparum genes. A putative TIM-barrel enzyme and other newly identified apicoplast biogenesis proteins open opportunities to discover new mechanisms of organelle biogenesis, molecular evolution underlying eukaryotic diversity, and drug targets against multiple parasitic diseases.

10.3892/ijmm.2019.4108  |  Prognosis, Genetics  |  Prognosis, Genetics  |  Cox Regression Nnivariate Analysis  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   The aim of the present study was to identify the important mRNAs, micro (mi)RNAs and long non‑coding (lnc)RNAs that are associated with osteosarcoma recurrence. The GSE3905 dataset, which contains two sub‑datasets (GSE39040 and GSE39055), was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Prognosis‑associated RNAs were identified by performing Cox regression univariate analysis and were subsequently used to construct a competing endogenous (ce)RNA regulatory network for Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Kaplan‑Meier survival analysis was used to determine the associations between expression levels and survival prognosis. In addition, another independent miRNA profile, GSE79181, was downloaded from GEO for validation. Among the differentially expressed RNAs, 417 RNAs (5 lncRNAs, 19 miRNAs, and 393 mRNAs) were observed to be associated with prognosis. The GSEA for the ceRNA regulatory network revealed that 'Mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway', 'Chemokine signaling pathway' and 'Spliceosome' were markedly associated with osteosarcoma. In addition, three lncRNAs [long intergenic non‑protein coding RNA 28 (LINC00028), LINC00323, and small nucleolar RNA host gene 1 (SNHG1)] and two miRNAs (hsa‑miR‑124 and hsa‑miR‑7) regulating three mRNAs [Ras‑related protein Rap‑1b (RAP1B), activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) and protein phosphatase Mg2+/Mn2+ dependent 1B (PPM1B)] participated in the MAPK signaling pathway. The Kaplan‑Meier survival analysis also demonstrated that samples with lower expression levels of LINC00323 and SNHG1 had better prognosis, and samples with increased expression levels of LINC00028, hsa‑miR‑124 and hsa‑miR‑7 had better prognosis. Overexpression of RAP1B, ATF2 and PPM1B was positively associated with osteosarcoma recurrence. The roles of hsa‑miR‑124 and hsa‑miR‑7 in osteosarcoma recurrence were also validated using GSE79181. Thus, in conclusions, the three lncRNAs (LINC00028, LINC00323 and SNHG1), two miRNAs (hsa‑miR‑124 and hsa‑miR‑7) and three mRNAs (RAP1B, ATF2, and PPM1B) were associated with osteosarcoma recurrence.

Whole-genome sequencing studies disclosed the genomic landscape of lung adenocarcinomas. however, it remains unclear if the genetic alternations could guide prognosis prediction. Effective genetic markers and their based prediction models are also at a lack for prognosis evaluation. 
  Methods:  We obtained the somatic mutation data and clinical data for 371 lung adenocarcinoma cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The cases were classified into two prognostic groups (3-year survival), and a comparison was performed between the groups for the somatic mutation frequencies of genes, followed by development of computational models to discrete the different prognosis. 
  Results:  Genes were found with higher mutation rates in good (≥ 3-year survival) than in poor (&lt; 3-year survival) prognosis group of lung adenocarcinoma patients. Genes participating in cell-cell adhesion and motility were significantly enriched in the top gene list with mutation rate difference between the good and poor prognosis group. Support Vector Machine models with the gene somatic mutation features could well predict prognosis, and the performance improved as feature size increased. An 85-gene model reached an average cross-validated accuracy of 81% and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.896 for the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. The model also exhibited good inter-stage prognosis prediction performance, with an average AUC of 0.846 for the ROC curves. 
  Conclusion:  The prognosis of lung adenocarcinomas is related with somatic gene mutations. The genetic markers could be used for prognosis prediction and furthermore provide guidance for personal medicine.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the MEC remain poorly understand. Here, we simultaneously detected, for the first time, the expression profiles of mRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs in four pairs of MEC and matched non-carcinoma tissues by microarrays. A total of 3612 mRNA, 3091 lncRNAs, and 284 circRNAs were altered during the pathogenesis of MEC. The functions of these differentially expressed RNAs were predicted by Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. Co-expression networks of lncRNA-mRNA and circRNA-miRNA were conducted to uncovered the hidden ceRNA mechanisms. Moreover, NONHSAT154433.1 that associated with ADAM12 and hsa_circ_0012342 were further screened and confirmed using qRT-PCR analysis. In conclusion, this study provides a systematic perspective on the potential function of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in the molecular mechanisms of MEC. Among these, NONHSAT154433.1 and hsa_circ_0012342 might be served as potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic target of MEC.

These intrinsic differences are closely related to clinical diagnosis and designation of treatment plans. With the accumulation of biological and medicine datasets, there are many different omics data that can be viewed in different aspects. Combining these multiple omics data can improve the accuracy of prediction. Meanwhile; there are also many different databases available for us to download different types of omics data. In this article, we use estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) to define breast cancer subtypes and classify any two breast cancer subtypes using SMO-MKL algorithm. We collected mRNA data, methylation data and copy number variation (CNV) data from TCGA to classify breast cancer subtypes. Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) is employed to use these omics data distinctly. The result of using three omics data with multiple kernels is better than that of using single omics data with multiple kernels. Furthermore; these significant genes and pathways discovered in the feature selection process are also analyzed. In experiments; the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and has abundant biological interpretations.

10.1093/nar/gkz594  |  Genetics  |  Genetics  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) contribute to ∼10 percent of the mouse genome. They are often silenced in differentiated somatic cells but differentially expressed at various embryonic developmental stages. A minority of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), like 2-cell cleavage embryos, highly express ERV MERVL. However, the role of ERVs and mechanism of their activation in these cells are still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the regulation and function of the stage-specific expressed ERVs, with a particular focus on the totipotency marker MT2/MERVL. We show that the transcription factor Zscan4c functions as an activator of MT2/MERVL and 2-cell/4-cell embryo genes. Zinc finger domains of Zscan4c play an important role in this process. In addition, Zscan4c interacts with MT2 and regulates MT2-nearby 2-cell/4-cell genes through promoting enhancer activity of MT2. Furthermore, MT2 activation is accompanied by enhanced H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and H3K14ac deposition on MT2. Zscan4c also interacts with GBAF chromatin remodelling complex through SCAN domain to further activate MT2 enhancer activity. Taken together, we delineate a previously unrecognized regulatory axis that Zscan4c interacts with and activates MT2/MERVL loci and their nearby genes through epigenetic regulation.

Long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) serve regulatory roles in various types of cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate the lncRNA expression profile in ESCC and to identify lncRNAs associated with the prognosis of ESCC by performing comprehensive bioinformatics analyses. The RNA‑sequencing (Seq) expression dataset GSE53625 generated from ESCC samples was used as a training dataset. Additional RNA‑Seq datasets relative to ESCC samples were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas and used as a validation dataset. Data were screened using the limma package, and differentially expressed lncRNAs between early‑ and late‑stage ESCC were identified. A random forest algorithm was used to select the optimal lncRNA biomarkers, which were then analyzed using the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm with R software. The identified lncRNA biomarkers were examined in the validation dataset by bidirectional hierarchical clustering and using an SVM classifier. Subsequently, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to analyze the potential ability lncRNAs to predict the survival rate of patients with ESCC. By examining the training group, 259 deregulated lncRNAs between early‑ and advanced‑stage ESCC were identified. Further bioinformatics analyses identified a nine‑lncRNA signature, including AC098973, AL133493, RP11‑51M24, RP11‑317N8, RP11‑834C11, RP11‑69C17, LINC00471, LINC01193 and RP1‑124C. This nine‑lncRNA signature was used to predict the tumor stage and patient survival rate with high reliability and accuracy in the training and validation datasets. Furthermore, these nine lncRNA biomarkers were primarily involved in regulating the cell cycle and DNA replication, and these processes were previously identified to be associated with the progression of ESCC. The identified nine‑lncRNA signature was identified to be associated with the tumor stage, and could be used as predictor of the survival rate of patients with ESCC.

The median overall survival time (OS) was 41.1 months. Cox multivariate analysis showed that smoking history, tumor stage, and surgical margin resection status were independently associated with PFS, and tumor stage and surgical margin resection status were independently associated with OS. The accuracy of the established ANN model itself was predicted to be 65.8%. The accuracy of correctly predicting the prognosis of the predicted samples was 75.0%, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.712.The clinical prognostic factors of lung adenocarcinoma include: smoking history, tumor stage, and surgical margin resection status. The established ANN model can be used to predict the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma.

Deep learning is a form of ML typically implemented via multi-layered neural networks. Deep learning has accelerated by recent advances in computer hardware and algorithms and is increasingly applied in e-commerce, finance, and voice and image recognition to learn and classify complex datasets. The current medical literature shows both strengths and limitations of DL. Strengths of DL include its ability to automate medical image interpretation, enhance clinical decision-making, identify novel phenotypes, and select better treatment pathways in complex diseases. Deep learning may be well-suited to cardiovascular medicine in which haemodynamic and electrophysiological indices are increasingly captured on a continuous basis by wearable devices as well as image segmentation in cardiac imaging. However, DL also has significant weaknesses including difficulties in interpreting its models (the 'black-box' criticism), its need for extensive adjudicated ('labelled') data in training, lack of standardization in design, lack of data-efficiency in training, limited applicability to clinical trials, and other factors. Thus, the optimal clinical application of DL requires careful formulation of solvable problems, selection of most appropriate DL algorithms and data, and balanced interpretation of results. This review synthesizes the current state of DL for cardiovascular clinicians and investigators, and provides technical context to appreciate the promise, pitfalls, near-term challenges, and opportunities for this exciting new area.

  Methods:  681 CT-scans (training: 479 CT-scans; validation: 202 CT-scans) from a multicenter clinical trial in patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer were retrospectively analyzed for algorithm development and validation. An additional external validation was performed on a cohort of 228 CT-scans from gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine cancer patients. Image acquisition was performed according to each centers' standard CT protocol for single portal venous phase, portal venous acquisition. The reference gold standard for the classification of PVP-timing as either optimal or nonoptimal was based on experienced radiologists' consensus opinion. The algorithm performed automated localization (on axial slices) of the portal vein and aorta upon which a novel dual input Convolutional Neural Network calculated a probability of the optimal PVP-timing. 
  Results:  The algorithm automatically computed a PVP-timing score in 3 seconds and reached area under the curve of 0.837 (95% CI: 0.765, 0.890) in validation set and 0.844 (95% CI: 0.786, 0.889) in external validation set. 
  Conclusion:  A fully automated, deep-learning derived PVP-timing algorithm was developed to classify scans' contrast-enhancement timing and identify scans with optimal PVP-timing. The rapid identification of such scans will aid in the analysis of quantitative (radiomics) features used to characterize tumors and changes in enhancement with treatment in a multitude of settings including quantitative response criteria such as Choi and MASS which rely on reproducible measurement of enhancement.

10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2019.07.017  |  Smart Healthcare  |  Smart Healthcare  |  Speech Recognition  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Objective:  To assess the role of speech recognition (SR) technology in clinicians' documentation workflows by examining use of, experience with and opinions about this technology. 
  Materials and methods:  We distributed a survey in 2016-2017 to 1731 clinician SR users at two large medical centers in Boston, Massachusetts and Aurora, Colorado. The survey asked about demographic and clinical characteristics, SR use and preferences, perceived accuracy, efficiency, and usability of SR, and overall satisfaction. Associations between outcomes (e.g., satisfaction) and factors (e.g., error prevalence) were measured using ordinal logistic regression. 
  Results:  Most respondents (65.3%) had used their SR system for under one year. 75.5% of respondents estimated seeing 10 or fewer errors per dictation, but 19.6% estimated half or more of errors were clinically significant. Although 29.4% of respondents did not include SR among their preferred documentation methods, 78.8% were satisfied with SR, and 77.2% agreed that SR improves efficiency. Satisfaction was associated positively with efficiency and negatively with error prevalence and editing time. Respondents were interested in further training about using SR effectively but expressed concerns regarding software reliability, editing and workflow. 
  Discussion:  Compared to other documentation methods (e.g., scribes, templates, typing, traditional dictation), SR has emerged as an effective solution, overcoming limitations inherent in other options and potentially improving efficiency while preserving documentation quality. 
  Conclusion:  While concerns about SR usability and accuracy persist, clinicians expressed positive opinions about its impact on workflow and efficiency. Faster and better approaches are needed for clinical documentation, and SR is likely to play an important role going forward.

10.1007/s00330-019-06447-7  |  Robotics  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Robotics  |  Deep Convolutional Neural Network  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Objective:  To classify motion-induced blurred images of calcified coronary plaques so as to correct coronary calcium scores on nontriggered chest CT, using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained by images of motion artifacts. 
  Methods:  Three artificial coronary arteries containing nine calcified plaques of different densities (high, medium, and low) and sizes (large, medium, and small) were attached to a moving robotic arm. The artificial arteries moving at 0-90 mm/s were scanned to generate nine categories (each from one calcified plaque) of images with motion artifacts. An inception v3 CNN was fine-tuned and validated. Agatston scores of the predicted classification by CNN were considered as corrected scores. Variation of Agatston scores on moving plaque and by CNN correction was calculated using the scores at rest as reference. 
  Results:  The overall accuracy of CNN classification was 79.2 ± 6.1% for nine categories. The accuracy was 88.3 ± 4.9%, 75.9 ± 6.4%, and 73.5 ± 5.0% for the high-, medium-, and low-density plaques, respectively. Compared with the Agatston score at rest, the overall median score variation was 37.8% (1st and 3rd quartile, 10.5% and 68.8%) in moving plaques. CNN correction largely decreased the variation to 3.7% (1.9%, 9.1%) (p &lt; 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test) and improved the sensitivity (percentage of non-zero scores among all the scores) from 65 to 85% for detection of coronary calcifications. 
  Conclusions:  In this experimental study, CNN showed the ability to classify motion-induced blurred images and correct calcium scores derived from nontriggered chest CT. CNN correction largely reduces the overall Agatston score variation and increases the sensitivity to detect calcifications. 
  Key points:  • A deep CNN architecture trained by CT images of motion artifacts showed the ability to correct coronary calcium scores from blurred images. • A correction algorithm based on deep CNN can be used for a tenfold reduction in Agatston score variations from 38 to 3.7% of moving coronary calcified plaques and to improve the sensitivity from 65 to 85% for the detection of calcifications. • This experimental study provides a method to improve its accuracy for coronary calcium scores that is a fundamental step towards a real clinical scenario.

10.1016/j.celrep.2019.11.083  |  Genetics  |  Genetics  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   In vitro gametogenesis is the process of making germline cells from human pluripotent stem cells. The foundation of this model is the quality of the first progenitors called primordial germ cells (PGCs), which in vivo are specified during the peri-implantation window of human development. Here, we show that human PGC (hPGC) specification begins at day 12 post-fertilization. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of hPGC-like cells (hPGCLCs) differentiated from pluripotent stem cells, we discovered that hPGCLC specification involves resetting pluripotency toward a transitional state with shared characteristics between naive and primed pluripotency, followed by differentiation into lineage-primed TFAP2A<sup>+</sup> progenitors. Applying the germline trajectory to TFAP2C mutants reveals that TFAP2C functions in the TFAP2A<sup>+</sup> progenitors upstream of PRDM1 to regulate the expression of SOX17. This serves to protect hPGCLCs from crossing the Weismann's barrier to adopt somatic cell fates and, therefore, is an essential mechanism for successfully initiating in vitro gametogenesis.

10.1097/BRS.0000000000002974  |  Treatment  |  Treatment  |  Artificial Intelligence, Unsupervised Hierarchical Clustering  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Review  |    Study design:  Retrospective review of prospectively-collected, multicenter adult spinal deformity (ASD) databases. 
  Objective:  To apply artificial intelligence (AI)-based hierarchical clustering as a step toward a classification scheme that optimizes overall quality, value, and safety for ASD surgery. 
  Summary of background data:  Prior ASD classifications have focused on radiographic parameters associated with patient reported outcomes. Recent work suggests there are many other impactful preoperative data points. However, the ability to segregate patient patterns manually based on hundreds of data points is beyond practical application for surgeons. Unsupervised machine-based clustering of patient types alongside surgical options may simplify analysis of ASD patient types, procedures and outcomes. 
  Methods:  Two prospective cohorts were queried for surgical ASD patients with baseline, 1-year, and 2-year SRS-22/ODI/SF-36v2 data. Two dendrograms were fitted, one with surgical features and one with patient characteristics. Both were built with Ward distances and optimized with the gap method. For each possible n patient cluster by m surgery, normalized 2-year improvement and major complication rates were computed. 
  Results:  570 patients were included. Three optimal patient types were identified: young with coronal plane deformity (YC, n = 195), older with prior spine surgeries (ORev, n = 157), and older without prior spine surgeries (OPrim, n = 218). Osteotomy type, instrumentation and interbody fusion were combined to define 4 surgical clusters. The intersection of patient-based and surgery-based clusters yielded 12 subgroups, with major complication rates ranging from 0% to 51.8% and 2-year normalized improvement ranging from -0.1% for SF36v2 MCS in cluster [1,3] to 100.2% for SRS self-image score in cluster [2,1]). 
  Conclusions:  Unsupervised hierarchical clustering can identify data patterns that may augment preoperative decision making through construction of a 2-year risk-benefit grid. In addition to creating a novel AI-based ASD classification, pattern identification may facilitate treatment optimization by educating surgeons on which treatment patterns yield optimal improvement with lowest risk.

10.1007/s11548-019-01931-3  |  Treatment  |  Treatment, Genetics  |  Computer-Aided  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Purpose:  For the parallel external fixator, there are some defects, such as uneven distraction rate, unbearable pain and uncontrollable movement trajectory in practical clinical applications. In order to solve the problems, a new deformity correction algorithm, which is used to calculate the elongation of the six struts, is developed. Meanwhile, the corresponding computer software for getting the electronic prescription is developed. 
  Methods:  First, the trajectory of the moving bone is planned by Cartesian coordinate path control. Next, the prescription is obtained from the trajectory by the inverse pose solution algorithm. Finally, the genetic algorithm is utilized to optimize the achieved prescription. From the year of 2015 to 2018, twenty-three patients with complicated tibia deformity are treated by using parallel external fixator and the developed computer software. All patients have standing, patella-forward, full-length post-operative AP and lateral radiographs of the lower limbs with the complete proximal ring for getting the deformity parameters and frame parameters. These parameters are input into the computer software to calculate a daily prescription schedule for strut adjustment. Radiographs are taken regularly to determine the effects of recovery during the correction process. 
  Results:  The mean time of follow-up is 18 months (range 11-40 months). All patients reach the requirements for deformity correction, and their symptoms and appearance are improved significantly. No cases of wound infections or complications occur, and no severe pain came as well during the correction process. 
  Conclusions:  By using the computer-aided parallel external fixator for the correction of lower limb deformities, satisfactory outcomes can be achieved. Hence, this method greatly improved the treatment of these patients in a clinical application.

10.1063/1.5120605  |  Prognosis  |  Prognosis  |  Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Understanding 3D scene geometry is a fundamental research topic in computer vision, including various subproblems, such as depth prediction, visual odometry, optical flow, etc. With the advent of artificial intelligence methods like deep learning, many approaches have emerged to deal with such problems in an end-to-end manner. These pipelines take the 3D understanding task as a nonlinear optimization problem, with the purpose of minimizing the cost function of the whole framework. Here, we present a self-supervised framework for jointly learning the monocular depth and camera's ego-motion from unlabeled, unstructured, and monocular video sequences. We propose a forward-backward consistency constraint on view reconstruction to capture temporal relations across adjacent frames, whose purpose is to explore and make full use of the bidirectional projection information. A simple and practicable improvement on the design of cost function is proposed to enhance the estimated accuracy. Due to the fact that our improvement is a lightweight and general module, it can be integrated into any self-supervised architectures seamlessly, and more accurate results can be obtained. The evaluation on the KITTI dataset demonstrates that our approach is highly efficient and performs better than the existing works in pose estimation, while the results in depth estimation perform comparably with the existing ones.

Here, we examined the roles of dermal cDC1s and cDC2s during bacterial infection, notably Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes). cDC1s, but not cDC2s, regulated the magnitude of the immune response to P. acnes in the murine dermis by controlling neutrophil recruitment to the inflamed site and survival and function therein. Single-cell mRNA sequencing revealed that this regulation relied on secretion of the cytokine vascular endothelial growth factor α (VEGF-α) by a minor subset of activated EpCAM<sup>+</sup>CD59<sup>+</sup>Ly-6D<sup>+</sup> cDC1s. Neutrophil recruitment by dermal cDC1s was also observed during S. aureus, bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), or E. coli infection, as well as in a model of bacterial insult in human skin. Thus, skin cDC1s are essential regulators of the innate response in cutaneous immunity and have roles beyond classical antigen presentation.

10.3390/s20010186  |  None  |  Diagnosis  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Siphons have been widely used in water supply systems and sewage networks. However, it is difficult to implement non-destructive testing due to structural complexity and limited accessibility. In this paper, a novel condition classification method for water-filled underground siphons is proposed, which uses the acoustic signals received from acoustic sensors installed in the siphon. The proposed method has the advantages of simpler operation, lower cost, and higher detection efficiency. The acoustic wave forms in the siphons reflect on the system characteristics. Seven typical conditions of a water-filled underground siphon were investigated, and a series of experiments were conducted. Acoustic signals were recorded and transformed into acoustic pressure responses for further analysis. The variational mode decomposition (VMD) and the acoustic energy flow density were used for signal processing and feature extraction. The acoustic energy flux density eigenvectors were input to three different classifiers to classify the siphon conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed acoustic-based approach can effectively classify the blockage and damage conditions of siphons, and the recognition accuracy of the proposed method is higher than 94.4%. Therefore, this research has value for engineering applications.

In this study, artificial intelligence was applied to develop a proxy for layperson assessments, and compare sensitivity to existing outcome measures. 
  Methods:  Artificially intelligent emotion detection software was used to develop the emotionality quotient. The emotionality quotient was defined as the percentage probability of perceived joy over the percentage probability of perceived negative emotions during smiling, as predicted by the software. The emotionality quotient was used to analyze the emotionality of voluntary smiles of normal subjects and unilateral facial palsy patients before and after smile reanimation. The emotionality quotient was compared to oral commissure excursion and layperson assessments of facial palsy patients. 
  Results:  In voluntary smiles of 10 normal subjects, 100 percent joy and no negative emotion was detected (interquartile ranges, 0/1). Median preoperative emotionality quotient of 30 facial palsy patients was 15/-60 (interquartile range, 73/62). Postoperatively, median emotionality quotient was 84/0 (interquartile range, 28/5). In 134 smile reanimation patients, no correlation was found between postoperative oral commissure excursion and emotionality quotient score. However, in 61 preoperative patients, a moderate correlation was found between layperson-assessed disfigurement and negative emotion perception (correlation coefficient, 0.516; p &lt; 0.001). 
  Conclusions:  Computer vision artificial intelligence software detected less joy and more negative emotion in smiles of facial palsy patients compared with normal subjects. Following smile reanimation, significantly more joy and less negative emotion were detected. The emotionality quotient was correlated with layperson assessments. The simplicity, sensitivity, and objectivity of the emotionality quotient render it an attractive tool to serve as a potential proxy for layperson assessment, an ideal outcome measure in facial palsy.

However, additional prognostic markers could be detected on pathological slides using artificial intelligence tools. 
  Design:  We have developed a software to detect colon tumour, healthy mucosa, stroma and immune cells on CD3 and CD8 stained slides. The lymphocyte density and surface area were quantified automatically in the tumour core (TC) and invasive margin (IM). Using a LASSO algorithm, DGMate (DiGital tuMor pArameTErs), we detected digital parameters within the tumour cells related to patient outcomes. 
  Results:  Within the dataset of 1018 patients, we observed that a poorer relapse-free survival (RFS) was associated with high IM stromal area (HR 5.65; 95% CI 2.34 to 13.67; p&lt;0.0001) and high DGMate (HR 2.72; 95% CI 1.92 to 3.85; p&lt;0.001). Higher CD3+ TC, CD3+ IM and CD8+ TC densities were significantly associated with a longer RFS. Analysis of variance showed that CD3+ TC yielded a similar prognostic value to the classical CD3/CD8 Immunoscore (p=0.44). A combination of the IM stromal area, DGMate and CD3, designated 'DGMuneS', outperformed Immunoscore when used in estimating patients' prognosis (C-index=0.601 vs 0.578, p=0.04) and was independently associated with patient outcomes following Cox multivariate analysis. A predictive nomogram based on DGMuneS and clinical variables identified a group of patients with less than 10% relapse risk and another group with a 50% relapse risk. 
  Conclusion:  These findings suggest that artificial intelligence can potentially improve patient care by assisting pathologists in better defining stage III colon cancer patients' prognosis.

  Materials and methods:  A total of 112 patients with glioblastoma who had MRI at 1.5- or 3.0-T were retrospectively included. There were 43 patients with glioblastoma with wild-type TERT (TERTw) (22 men, 21 women; mean age, 47±25 [SD] years; age range: 3-84 years) and 69 patients with glioblastoma with TERTm (34 men, 35 women; mean age 64±11 [SD] years; age range, 41--85 years). The feature vectors consist of 11 input units for two clinical parameters (age and gender) and nine MRI characteristics (tumor location, subventricular extension, cortical extension, multiplicity, enhancing volume, necrosis volume, the percentage of necrosis volume, minimum apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC] and normalized ADC). First, the diagnostic performance using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses was evaluated. Second, the cross-validation of the support vector machine (SVM) was performed by using leave-one-out method with 43 TERTw and 69 TERTm to evaluate the diagnostic performance. In addition, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy for the differentiation between TERTw and TERTm were compared between logistic regression analysis and SVM. 
  Results:  With multivariate analysis, the percentage of necrosis volume and age were significantly greater in TERTm glioblastoma than in TERTw glioblastoma. SVM allowed discriminating between TERTw glioblastoma and TERTm glioblastoma with sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of 85.7% [60/70; 95% confidence interval (CI): 75.3-92.9%], 54.8% (23/42; 95% CI: 38.7-70.2%), 75.9% (60/79; 95% CI: 69.1-81.7%), 69.7% (23/33; 95% CI: 54.9-81.3%) and 74.1% (83/112; 95% CI: 65.0-81.9%), respectively. 
  Conclusion:  The percentage of necrosis volume and age may surrogate for predicting TERT mutation status in glioblastoma.

To gain a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of cisplatin resistance, we comparatively analyzed established a CDDP-resistant neuroblastoma cell line (UKF-NB-4<sup>CDDP</sup>) and its susceptible parental cells (UKF-NB-4). We verified increased chemoresistance of UKF-NB-4<sup>CDDP</sup> cells by analyzing the viability, induction of apoptosis and clonal efficiency. To shed more light on this phenomenon, we employed custom cDNA microarray (containing 2234 probes) to perform parallel transcriptomic profiling of RNA and identified that 139 genes were significantly up-regulated due to CDDP chemoresistance. The analyses of molecular pathways indicated that the top up-regulation scoring functions were response to stress, abiotic stimulus, regulation of metabolic process, apoptotic processes, regulation of cell proliferation, DNA repair or regulation of catalytic activity, which was also evidenced by analysis of molecular functions revealing up-regulation of genes encoding several proteins with a wide-spectrum of enzymatic activities. Functional analysis using lysosomotropic agents chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 validated their potential to re-sensitize UKF-NB-4<sup>CDDP</sup> cells to CDDP. Taken together, the identification of alterations in specific genes and pathways that contribute to CDDP chemoresistance may potentially lead to a renewed interest in the development of novel rational therapeutics and prognostic biomarkers for the management of CDDP-resistant neuroblastoma.

10.1371/journal.pone.0217593  |  Genetics, Treatment  |  Genetics  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Pueraria thomsonii Benth is an important medicinal plant. Transcriptome sequencing, unigene assembly, the annotation of transcripts and the study of gene expression profiles play vital roles in gene function research. However, the full-length transcriptome of P. thomsonii remains unknown. Here, we obtained 44,339 nonredundant transcripts of P. thomsonii by using the PacBio RS II Isoform and Illumina sequencing platforms, of which 43,195 were annotated genes. Compared with the expression levels in the plant roots, those of transcripts with a |fold change| ≥ 4 and FDR &lt; 0.01 in the leaves or stems were assigned as differentially expressed transcripts (DETs). In total, we found 9,225 DETs, 32 of which came from structural genes that were potentially involved in isoflavone biosynthesis. The expression profiles of 8 structural genes from the RNA-Seq data were validated by qRT-PCR. We identified 437 transcription factors (TFs) that were positively or negatively correlated with at least 1 of the structural genes involved in isoflavone biosynthesis using Pearson correlation coefficients (r) (r &gt; 0.8 or r &lt; -0.8). We also identified a total of 32 microRNAs (miRNAs), which targeted 805 transcripts. These miRNAs caused enriched function in 'ATP binding', 'defense response', 'ADP binding', and 'signal transduction'. Interestingly, MIR156a potentially promoted isoflavone biosynthesis by repressing SBP, and MIR319 promoted isoflavone biosynthesis by repressing TCP and HB-HD-ZIP. Finally, we identified 2,690 alternative splicing events, including that of the structural genes of trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase and pullulanase, which are potentially involved in the biosynthesis of isoflavone and starch, respectively, and of three TFs potentially involved in isoflavone biosynthesis. Together, these results provide us with comprehensive insight into the gene expression and regulation of P. thomsonii.

Advances in precision medicine have shifted the research focus toward underlying genetic differences. However, nonbiological factors may have a large role in these observed disparities. Therefore, we sought to measure the relative importance of race compared to health care and social factors on prostate cancer specific mortality. 
  Materials and methods:  Using the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) database we identified 514,878 men diagnosed with prostate cancer at age 40 years or greater between 2004 and 2012. We also selected a subset of black and white men matched by age, stage and birth year. We stratified patients by age 40 to 54, 55 to 69 and 70 years or older and disease stage, resulting in 18 groups. By applying random forest methods with variable importance measures we analyzed 15 variables and interactions across 4 categories of factors (tumor characteristics, race, and health care and social factors) and the relative importance for prostate cancer specific mortality. 
  Results:  Tumor characteristics at diagnosis were the most important factors for prostate cancer mortality. Across all groups race was less than 5% as important as tumor characteristics and only more important than health care and social factors in 2 of the 18 groups. Although race had a significant impact, health care and social factors known to be associated with racial disparities had greater or similarly important effects across all ages and stages. 
  Conclusions:  Eradicating disparities in prostate cancer survival will require a multipronged approach, including advances in precision medicine. Disparities will persist unless health care access and social equality are achieved among all populations.

10.3802/jgo.2019.30.e65  |  Prognosis  |  Prognosis  |  Gradient Boosting  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Objectives:  The aim of this study was to develop a new prognostic classification for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients using gradient boosting (GB) and to compare the accuracy of the prognostic model with the conventional statistical method. 
  Methods:  Information of EOC patients from Samsung Medical Center (training cohort, n=1,128) was analyzed to optimize the prognostic model using GB. The performance of the final model was externally validated with patient information from Asan Medical Center (validation cohort, n=229). The area under the curve (AUC) by the GB model was compared to that of the conventional Cox proportional hazard regression analysis (CoxPHR) model. 
  Results:  In the training cohort, the AUC of the GB model for predicting second year overall survival (OS), with the highest target value, was 0.830 (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.802-0.853). In the validation cohort, the GB model also showed high AUC of 0.843 (95% CI=0.833-0.853). In comparison, the conventional CoxPHR method showed lower AUC (0.668 (95% CI=0.617-0.719) for the training cohort and 0.597 (95% CI=0.474-0.719) for the validation cohort) compared to GB. New classification according to survival probability scores of the GB model identified four distinct prognostic subgroups that showed more discriminately classified prediction than the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging system. 
  Conclusion:  Our novel GB-guided classification accurately identified the prognostic subgroups of patients with EOC and showed higher accuracy than the conventional method. This approach would be useful for accurate estimation of individual outcomes of EOC patients.

We previously identified a short gene-encoded peptide (OA-VI12) from Odorrana andersonii frog skin secretions that exerted direct scavenging capacity against free radicals, suggesting a possible function in protecting skin against photodamage caused by their high-altitude habitat. In the current research, we examined the effects of OA-VI12 on both UVB-irradiation and hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress models established with human immortalized keratinocytes. In addition, we identified the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the oxidative stress and OA-VI12 groups and further performed transcriptome as well as functional and pathway enrichment analyses. Results showed that OA-VI12 protected cell viability, promoted the release of catalase, and decreased the levels of lactate dehydrogenase and reactive oxygen species. Moreover, the peptide promoted the production of superoxide dismutase and glutathione, alleviated epidermis and dermis thickness, and decreased the production of light spots and collagen fibers in skin from the photo-injured mouse model. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis showed mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) to be the most abundant signaling pathway. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis indicated that the top 55 significantly enriched GO terms mainly involved cellular processes, parts, and binding. These results revealed the beneficial role of the small molecule gene-encoding antioxidant peptide (OA-VI12) and its potential application as a protective agent against photodamage.

10.1007/s11010-019-03569-w  |  Genetics  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Genetics  |  Bioinformatics  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   The aim of our study is to explore the regulation of C1QTNF1-AS1 on its target miR-221-3p/SOCS3 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To explore the underlying molecular regulation of non-coding RNA for HCC, differentially expressed patterns of lncRNAs and genes were examined by RNA-seq. GO and KEGG pathway analysis were done based on the function of mRNAs that mediated by differentially expressed lncRNAs. RT-qPCR and western blot were conducted to detect the mRNA and protein level expression of C1QTNF1-AS1, miR-221-3p, SOCS3 and key proteins in JAK/STAT signaling pathway in HCC tissues and cells. The target miRNA of differentially expressed C1QTNF1-AS1 and SOCS3 was miR-221-3p predicted by bioinformatics analysis. C1QTNF1-AS1 and SOCS3 was downregulated and miR-221-3p was upregulated in HCC tissues and cells. In HepG2 and Huh-7 cells, the overexpression of C1QTNF1-AS1 or SOCS3, and silencing of miR-221-3p inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion and JAK/STAT signaling pathway, while promoted cell apoptosis. The results of dual-luciferase assay indicated that C1QTNF1-AS1 regulated miR-221-3p and miR-221-3p targeted SOCS3 by directly binding. And the growth of HCC in vivo was impeded when C1QTNF1-AS1 was upregulated. Overexpression of C1QTNF1-AS1 could downregulate miR-221-3p thereby inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells.

10.3390/ijms20215392  |  Treatment, Genetics  |  Treatment, Genetics  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Watermelon is a good source of citrulline, a non-protein amino acid. Citrulline has several therapeutic and clinical implications as it produces nitric oxide via arginine. In plants, citrulline plays a pivotal role in nitrogen transport and osmoprotection. The purpose of this study was to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers associated with citrulline metabolism using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and understand the role of citrulline in watermelon domestication. A watermelon collection consisting of 187 wild, landraces, and cultivated accessions was used to estimate citrulline content. An association analysis involved a total of 12,125 SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) &gt;0.05 in understanding the population structure and phylogeny in light of citrulline accumulation. Wild egusi types and landraces contained low to medium citrulline content, whereas cultivars had higher content, which suggests that obtaining higher content of citrulline is a domesticated trait. GWAS analysis identified candidate genes (<i>f</i><i>errochelatase</i> and <i>a</i><i>cetolactate</i> <i>s</i><i>ynthase</i>) showing a significant association of SNPs with citrulline content. Haplotype networking indicated positive selection from wild to domesticated watermelon. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing genetic regulation of citrulline variation in plants by using a GWAS strategy. These results provide new insights into the citrulline metabolism in plants and the possibility of incorporating high citrulline as a trait in watermelon breeding programs.

10.1186/s12864-019-6250-8  |  Genetics  |  Drug Discovery, Genetics  |  Comprehensive Molecular Network  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Gynostemma pentaphyllum is an important perennial medicinal herb belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. Aerial stem-to-rhizome transition before entering the winter is an adaptive regenerative strategy in G. pentaphyllum that enables it to survive during winter. However, the molecular regulation of aerial stem-to-rhizome transition is unknown in plants. Here, integrated transcriptome and miRNA analysis was conducted to investigate the regulatory network of stem-to-rhizome transition. 
  Results:  Nine transcriptome libraries prepared from stem/rhizome samples collected at three stages of developmental stem-to-rhizome transition were sequenced and a total of 5428 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. DEGs associated with gravitropism, cell wall biosynthesis, photoperiod, hormone signaling, and carbohydrate metabolism were found to regulate stem-to-rhizome transition. Nine small RNA libraries were parallelly sequenced, and seven significantly differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were identified, including four known and three novel miRNAs. The seven DEMs targeted 123 mRNAs, and six pairs of miRNA-target showed significantly opposite expression trends. The GpmiR166b-GpECH2 module involved in stem-to-rhizome transition probably promotes cell expansion by IBA-to-IAA conversion, and the GpmiR166e-GpSGT-like module probably protects IAA from degradation, thereby promoting rhizome formation. GpmiR156a was found to be involved in stem-to-rhizome transition by inhibiting the expression of GpSPL13A/GpSPL6, which are believed to negatively regulate vegetative phase transition. GpmiR156a and a novel miRNA Co.47071 co-repressed the expression of growth inhibitor GpRAV-like during stem-to-rhizome transition. These miRNAs and their targets were first reported to be involved in the formation of rhizomes. In this study, the expression patterns of DEGs, DEMs and their targets were further validated by quantitative real-time PCR, supporting the reliability of sequencing data. 
  Conclusions:  Our study revealed a comprehensive molecular network regulating the transition of aerial stem to rhizome in G. pentaphyllum. These results broaden our understanding of developmental phase transitions in plants.

10.3390/ijms20133334  |  Genetics  |  Genetics  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   We examined the substrate preference of <i>Cuphea paucipetala</i> acyl-ACP thioesterases, <i>CpFatB4</i> and <i>CpFatB5</i>, and gene expression changes associated with the modification of lipid composition in the seed, using <i>Brassica napus</i> transgenic plants overexpressing <i>CpFatB4</i> or <i>CpFatB5</i> under the control of a seed-specific promoter. <i>CpFatB4</i> seeds contained a higher level of total saturated fatty acid (FA) content, with 4.3 times increase in 16:0 palmitic acid, whereas <i>CpFatB5</i> seeds showed approximately 3% accumulation of 10:0 and 12:0 medium-chain FAs, and a small increase in other saturated FAs, resulting in higher levels of total saturated FAs. RNA-Seq analysis using entire developing pods at 8, 25, and 45 days after flowering (DAF) showed up-regulation of genes for β-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase I/II, stearoyl-ACP desaturase, oleate desaturase, and linoleate desaturase, which could increase unsaturated FAs and possibly compensate for the increase in 16:0 palmitic acid at 45 DAF in <i>CpFatB4</i> transgenic plants. In <i>CpFatB5</i> transgenic plants, many putative chloroplast- or mitochondria-encoded genes were identified as differentially expressed. Our results report comprehensive gene expression changes induced by alterations of seed FA composition and reveal potential targets for further genetic modifications.

10.1186/s12967-019-1800-z  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Genetics  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Recently, circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been reported to be microRNA sponges and play essential roles in cancer development. This study aimed to evaluate whether circulating circRNAs could be used as diagnostic biomarkers for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). 
  Methods:  The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset was used to investigate differentially expressed circRNAs (DEcircRNAs) in paired LUAD tissues and adjacent nontumor tissues. The expression levels of the host genes were analyzed in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-LUAD dataset, and the prognostic value was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier plotter. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to validate the expression of candidate circRNAs in the LUAD plasma and cells. The CCK8 assay was used to measure the function of circRNAs in cell proliferation. Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network, gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed to predict the possible mechanisms and functions of circRNAs in LUAD. 
  Results:  Two upregulated and two downregulated circRNAs were identified as candidate circRNAs using bioinformatics analysis. qRT-PCR demonstrated that hsa_circ_0005962 was upregulated in LUAD plasma and cells, whereas hsa_circ_0086414 was downregulated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis confirmed that a signature comprising the two circRNAs had good diagnostic potential, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.81 (P &lt; 0.0001). In addition, we observed that overexpression of plasma hsa_circ_0086414 was related to EGFR mutations (P = 0.001). Plasma hsa_circ_0005962 displayed significantly different expression before and after surgery in patients with LUAD (P &lt; 0.0001). In vitro experiments suggested that hsa_circ_0005962 promoted LUAD cell proliferation. For future studies, we predicted the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network for hsa_circ_0005962. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that hsa_circ_0005962 might be involved in LUAD development. 
  Conclusion:  A circRNA signature was identified as a potential noninvasive biomarker for LUAD diagnosis.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and imaging characteristics to predict the presence of H3 K27M mutation in spinal cord glioma using a machine learning-based classification model. 
  Methods:  A total of 41 spinal cord glioma patients consisting of 24 H3 K27M mutants and 17 wild types were enrolled in this retrospective study. A total of 17 clinical and radiological features were evaluated. The random forest (RF) model was trained with the clinical and radiological features to predict the presence of H3 K27M mutation. The diagnostic ability of the RF model was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Area under the ROC curves (AUC) was calculated. 
  Results:  MR imaging features of spinal cord diffuse midline gliomas were heterogeneous. Hemorrhage was the only variable that was able to differentiate H3 K27M mutated tumors from wild-type tumors in univariate analysis (p = 0.033). RF classifier yielded 0.632 classification AUC (95% CI, 0.456-0.808), 63.4% accuracy, 45.8% sensitivity, and 88.2% specificity. 
  Conclusion:  Our findings indicate that clinical and radiological features are associated with H3 K27M mutation status in spinal cord glioma.

The aim of this study was to identify the potential biomarker in ccRCC and explore their underlying mechanisms. Four profile datasets were downloaded from the GEO database to identify DEGs. GO and KEGG analysis of DEGs were performed by DAVID. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to predict hub genes. The hub gene expression within ccRCC across multiple datasets and the overall survival analysis were investigated utilizing the Oncomine Platform and UALCAN dataset, separately. A meta-analysis was performed to explore the relationship between the hub genes: EGFR and ccRCC. 127 DEGs (55 upregulated genes and 72 downregulated genes) were identified from four profile datasets. Integrating the result from PPI network, Oncomine Platform, and survival analysis, EGFR, FLT1, and EDN1 were screened as key factors in the prognosis of ccRCC. GO and KEGG analysis revealed that 127 DEGs were mainly enriched in 21 terms and 4 pathways. The meta-analysis showed that there was a significant difference of EGFR expression between ccRCC tissues and normal tissues, and the expression of EGFR in patients with metastasis was higher. This study identified 3 importance genes (EGFR, FLT1, and EDN1) in ccRCC, and EGFR may be a potential prognostic biomarker and novel therapeutic target for ccRCC, especially patients with metastasis.

10.1530/JOE-18-0493  |  Prognosis  |  Genetics  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Offspring of diabetic mothers are susceptible to developing type 2 diabetes due to pancreatic islet dysfunction. However, the initiating molecular pathways leading to offspring pancreatic islet dysfunction are unknown. We hypothesized that maternal hyperglycemia alters offspring pancreatic islet transcriptome and negatively impacts offspring islet function. We employed an infusion model capable of inducing localized hyperglycemia in fetal rats residing in the left uterine horn, thus avoiding other factors involved in programming offspring pancreatic islet health. While maintaining euglycemia in maternal dams and right uterine horn control fetuses, hyperglycemic fetuses in the left uterine horn had higher serum insulin and pancreatic beta cell area. Upon completing infusion from GD20 to 22, RNA sequencing was performed on GD22 islets to identify the hyperglycemia-induced altered gene expression. Ingenuity pathway analysis of the altered transcriptome found that diabetes mellitus and inflammation/cell death pathways were enriched. Interestingly, the downregulated genes modulate more diverse biological processes, which includes responses to stimuli and developmental processes. Next, we performed ex and in vivo studies to evaluate islet cell viability and insulin secretory function in weanling and adult offspring. Pancreatic islets of weanlings exposed to late gestation hyperglycemia had decreased cell viability in basal state and glucose-induced insulin secretion. Lastly, adult offspring exposed to in utero hyperglycemia also exhibited glucose intolerance and insulin secretory dysfunction. Together, our results demonstrate that late gestational hyperglycemia alters the fetal pancreatic islet transcriptome and increases offspring susceptibility to developing pancreatic islet dysfunction.

Here, we describe an accurate method for measurement and analysis of spine morphology based on structured illumination microscopy (SIM) and computational geometry in cultured neurons. Surface mesh data converted from SIM images were comparable to data reconstructed from electron microscopic images. Dimensional reduction and machine learning applied to large data sets enabled identification of spine phenotypes caused by genetic mutations in key signal transduction molecules. This method, combined with time-lapse live imaging and glutamate uncaging, could detect plasticity-related changes in spine head curvature. The results suggested that the concave surfaces of spines are important for the long-term structural stabilization of spines by synaptic adhesion molecules.

Surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy using the alkylating agent Temozolomide (TMZ) remain the mainstay of treatment for glioma. While this multimodal regimen is sufficient to temporarily eliminate the bulk of the tumor mass, recurrence is inevitable and often poses major challenges for clinical management due to treatment resistance and failure to respond to targeted therapies. Improved tumor profiling capacity has enabled characterization of the genomic landscape of gliomas with the overarching goal to identify clinically relevant subtypes and inform treatment decisions. Increased tumor mutational load has been shown to correlate with higher levels of neoantigens and is indicative of the potential to induce a durable response to immunotherapy. Following treatment with TMZ, a subset of glioma has been identified to recur with increased tumor mutational load. These hypermutant recurrent glioma represent a subtype of recurrence with unique molecular vulnerabilities. In this review, we will elaborate on the current knowledge regarding the evolution of hypermutation in gliomas and the potential therapeutic opportunities that arise with TMZ-induced hypermutation in gliomas.

Several tools have been developed recently to decrease the complexity of the process. Artificial intelligence and machine learning methods offer promising results in predicting the binding affinities. It becomes possible to do accurate predictions by using the known protein-ligand interactions. In this study, the electrostatic potential values extracted from 3-dimensional grid cubes of the drug-protein binding sites are used for predicting binding affinities of related complexes. A new algorithm with a dynamic feature selection method was implemented, which is derived from Compressed Images For Affinity Prediction (CIFAP) study, to predict binding affinities of Checkpoint Kinase 1 and Caspase 3 inhibitors.

Developing novel methods to identify early AKI onset is of critical importance in preventing or reducing AKI complications. We built and applied multiple machine learning models to integrate clinical notes and structured physiological measurements and estimate the risk of new AKI onset using the MIMIC-III database. From the clinical notes, we generated clinically meaningful word representations and embeddings. Four supervised learning classifiers and mixed-feature deep learning architecture were used to construct prediction models. The best configurations consistently utilized both structured and unstructured clinical features and yielded competitive AUCs above 0.83. Our work suggests that integrating structured and unstructured clinical features can be effectively applied to assist clinicians in identifying the risk of incident AKI onset in critically-ill patients upon admission to the ICU.

However, existing measurement science for economic disparity (e.g., the Gini coefficient) does not explicitly consider a probability distribution with information, deficiencies, and uncertainties associated with the underlying income distribution. This article introduces the quantification of Shannon entropy for income inequality across scales, including national-, subnational-, and city-level data. The probabilistic principles of Shannon entropy provide a new interpretation for uncertainty and risk related to economic disparity. Entropy and information-based conflict rise as world incomes converge. High-entropy instances can resemble both happy and prosperous societies as well as a socialist-communist social structure. Low entropy signals high-risk tipping points for anomaly and conflict detection with higher confidence. Finally, spatial-temporal entropy maps for U.S. cities offer a city risk profiling framework. The results show polarization of household incomes within and across Baltimore, Washington, DC, and San Francisco. Entropy produces reliable results at significantly reduced computational costs than Gini coefficients.

Although neuroscientific methods have managed to provide significant insights at the micro and macro level, in order to obtain a whole-brain analysis at a cellular resolution requires a meso-scopic approach. A number of methods can be currently used to detect and count cells, with, nevertheless, significant limitations when analyzing data of high complexity. To overcome some of these constraints, we introduce a fully automated Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based method for whole-brain image processing to Detect Neurons in different brain Regions during Development (DeNeRD). We demonstrate a high performance of our deep neural network in detecting neurons labeled with different genetic markers in a range of imaging planes and imaging modalities.

They can indicate binding sites for transcription factors and they encode certain proteins. Finding genes from biological sequences is a major task in computational biology for unraveling the mechanisms of gene expression. 
  Objective:  Planted motif finding problems are a class of mathematical models abstracted from the process of detecting genes from genome, in which a specific gene with a number of mutations is planted into a randomly generated background sequence, and then gene finding algorithms can be tested to check if the planted gene can be found in feasible time. 
  Methods:  In this work, a spectral rotation method based on triplet periodicity property is proposed to solve planted motif finding problems. 
  Results:  The proposed method gives significant tolerance of base mutations in genes. Specifically, genes having a number of substitutions can be detected from randomly generated background sequences. Experimental results on genomic data set from Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveal that genes can be visually distinguished. It is proposed that genes with about 50% mutations can be detected from randomly generated background sequences. 
  Conclusion:  It is found that with about 5 insertions or deletions, this method fails in finding the planted genes. For a particular case, if the deletion of bases is located at the beginning of the gene, that is, bases are not randomly deleted, then the tolerance of the method for base deletion is increased.

Retaining quality while ensuring high per-batch production yields is the main challenge. Batch processing and other dynamic strategies that preserve product quality can be applied, but they typically involve a variety of experimental parameters and functions that are difficult to optimize because of interdependencies that are often antagonistic. Adaptive Bayesian optimization is demonstrated here as a valuable support tool in increasing both the per-batch yield and quality of short polymer fibers, produced by wet spinning and shear dispersion methods. Through this approach, it is shown that short fiber dispersions with high yield and a specified, targeted fiber length distribution can be obtained with minimal cost of optimization, starting from sub-optimal processing conditions and minimal prior knowledge. The Bayesian function optimization demonstrated here for batch processing could be applied to other dynamic scale-up methods as well as to cases presenting higher dimensional challenges such as shape and structure optimization. This work shows the great potential of synergies between industrial processing, material engineering, and machine learning perspectives.

However, the largest obstacle towards the deployment of automated vehicles on public roads is their safety evaluation and validation. Undeniably, the role of cameras and Artificial Intelligence-based (AI) vision is vital in the perception of the driving environment and road safety. Although a significant number of studies on the detection and tracking of vehicles have been conducted, none of them focused on the role of vertical vehicle dynamics. For the first time, this paper analyzes and discusses the influence of road anomalies and vehicle suspension on the performance of detecting and tracking driving objects. To this end, we conducted an extensive road field study and validated a computational tool for performing the assessment using simulations. A parametric study revealed the cases where AI-based vision underperforms and may significantly degrade the safety performance of AVs.

PTHS results in individuals that have moderate to severe intellectual disability, with most exhibiting psychomotor delay. PTHS also exhibits features of autistic spectrum disorders, which are characterized by the impaired ability to communicate and socialize. PTHS is comorbid with a higher prevalence of epileptic seizures which can be present from birth or which commonly develop in childhood. Attenuated or absent TCF4 expression results in increased translation of peripheral ion channels K<sub>v</sub>7.1 and Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 which triggers an increase in after-hyperpolarization and altered firing properties. 
  Methods:  We now describe a high throughput screen (HTS) of 1280 approved drugs and machine learning models developed from this data. The ion channels were expressed in either CHO (K<sub>V</sub>7.1) or HEK293 (Na<sub>v</sub>1.8) cells and the HTS used either <sup>86</sup>Rb<sup>+</sup> efflux (K<sub>V</sub>7.1) or a FLIPR assay (Na<sub>v</sub>1.8). 
  Results:  The HTS delivered 55 inhibitors of K<sub>v</sub>7.1 (4.2% hit rate) and 93 inhibitors of Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 (7.2% hit rate) at a screening concentration of 10 μM. These datasets also enabled us to generate and validate Bayesian machine learning models for these ion channels. We also describe a structure activity relationship for several dihydropyridine compounds as inhibitors of Na<sub>v</sub>1.8. 
  Conclusions:  This work could lead to the potential repurposing of nicardipine or other dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists as potential treatments for PTHS acting via Na<sub>v</sub>1.8, as there are currently no approved treatments for this rare disorder.

Although a large number of studies have identified the expression changes of microRNAs (miRNAs) under N stress in several species, the miRNAs expression patterns of N-deficient plants under N resupply remain unclear. 
  Objective:  The primary objective of this study was to identify miRNAs in response to nitrogen stress and understand relevant physiological changes in nitrogen-deficient maize after nitrogen resupply. 
  Methods:  Physiological parameters were measured to study relevant physiological changes under different nitrogen conditions. Small RNA sequencing and qRT-PCR analysis were performed to understand the response of miRNAs under different nitrogen conditions. 
  Results:  The content of chlorophyll, soluble protein and nitrate nitrogen decreased than CK by 0.52, 0.49 and 0.82 times after N deficiency treatment and increased than ND by 0.52, 1.36 and 0.65 times after N resupply, respectively. Conversely, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) increased by 0.67 and 1.64 times than CK after N deficiency, respectively, and decreased by 0.09 and 0.35 times than ND after N resupply. A total of 226 known miRNAs were identified by sRNA sequencing; 106 miRNAs were differentially expressed between the control and N-deficient groups, and 103 were differentially expressed between the N-deficient and N-resupply groups (P &lt; 0.05). Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to further validate and analyze the expression of the identified miRNAs. A total of 1609 target genes were identified by target prediction, and some differentially expressed miRNAs were predicted to target transcription factors and functional proteins. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was used to determine the biological function of these targets and revealed that some miRNAs, such as miR169, miR1214, miR2199, miR398, miR408 and miR827 might be involved in nitrogen metabolism regulation. 
  Conclusion:  Our study comprehensively provides important information on miRNA functions and molecular mechanisms in response to N stress. These findings may assist to improve nitrogen availability in plants.

10.3390/ijms20133321  |  Genetics  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Genetics  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Radish is a crucial vegetable crop of the <i>Brassicaceae</i> family with many varieties and large cultivated area in China. Radish is a cool season crop, and there are only a few heat tolerant radish varieties in practical production with little information concerning the related genes in response to heat stress. In this work, some physiological parameter changes of young leaves under short-term heat stress were detected. Furthermore, we acquired 1802 differentially expressed mRNAs (including encoding some heat shock proteins, heat shock factor and heat shock-related transcription factors), 169 differentially expressed lncRNAs and three differentially expressed circRNAs (novel_circ_0000265, novel_circ_0000325 and novel_circ_0000315) through strand-specific RNA sequencing technology. We also found 10 differentially expressed miRNAs (ath-miR159b-3p, athmiR159c, ath-miR398a-3p, athmiR398b-3p, ath-miR165a-5p, ath-miR169g-3p, novel_86, novel_107, novel_21 and ath-miR171b-3p) by small RNA sequencing technology. Through function prediction and enrichment analysis, our results suggested that the significantly possible pathways/complexes related to heat stress in radish leaves were circadian rhythm-plant, photosynthesis-antenna proteins, photosynthesis, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, arginine and proline metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, peroxisome and plant hormone signal transduction. Besides, we identified one lncRNA-miRNA-mRNAs combination responsive to heat stress. These results will be helpful for further illustration of molecular regulation networks of how radish responds to heat stress.

10.1186/s12870-019-1712-3  |  Genetics  |  Genetics  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are 3'-5' head-to-tail covalently closed non-coding RNA that have been proved to play essential roles in many cellular and developmental processes. However, no information relate to cucumber circRNAs is available currently, especially under salt stress condition. 
  Results:  In this study, we sequenced circRNAs in cucumber and a total of 2787 were identified, with 1934 in root and 44 in leaf being differentially regulated under salt stress. Characteristics analysis of these circRNAs revealed following features: most of them are exon circRNAs (79.51%) and they prefer to arise from middle exon(s) of parent genes (2035/2516); moreover, most of circularization events (88.3%) use non-canonical-GT/AG splicing signals; last but not least, pairing-driven circularization is not the major way to generate cucumber circRNAs since very few circRNAs (18) contain sufficient flanking complementary sequences. Annotation and enrichment analysis of both parental genes and target mRNAs were launched to uncover the functions of differentially expressed circRNAs induced by salt stress. The results showed that circRNAs may be paly roles in salt stress response by mediating transcription, signal transcription, cell cycle, metabolism adaptation, and ion homeostasis related pathways. Moreover, circRNAs may function to regulate proline metabolisms through regulating associated biosynthesis and degradation genes. 
  Conclusions:  The present study identified large number of cucumber circRNAs and function annotation revealed their possible biological roles in response to salt stress. Our findings will lay a solid foundation for further structure and function studies of cucumber circRNAs.

Prior germplasm screens identified an exotic landrace able to maintain ~ 95% seed germination under stress conditions that reduce germination dramatically (&gt; 50%) for typical soybean seeds. Seed transcriptomic analysis was performed for two soybean lines (a heat-tolerant landrace and a typical high-yielding adapted line) for dry, mature seed, 6-h imbibed seed and germinated seed. Seeds were produced in two environments: a typical Midwestern field and a heat stressed field located in the Midsouth soybean production region. 
  Results:  Transcriptomic analysis revealed 23-30K expressed genes in each seed tissue sample, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with ≥ twofold gene expression differences (at q-value &lt; 0.05) comprised ~ 5-44% of expressed genes. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on DEGs revealed enrichment in heat-tolerant seeds for genes annotated for general and temperature-specific stress, as well as protein-refolding. DEGs were also clustered in modules using weighted co-expressed gene network analysis, which were examined for enrichment of GO biological process terms. Collectively, our results provide new and valuable insights into this unique form of genetic abiotic stress tolerance and to soybean seed physiological responses to elevated temperatures.

10.1159/000503776  |  Treatment  |  Prognosis, Treatment, Genetics  |  Artificial Intelligence  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) occurs in approximately 10-12% of treatments. Whereas several definitions for IDH are available, a nadir systolic blood pressure carries the strongest relation with outcome. Whereas the relation between IDH may partly be based on patient characteristics, it is likely that also impaired organ perfusion leading to permanent damage, plays a role in this relationship. The pathogenesis of IDH is multifactorial and is based on a combination of a decline in blood volume (BV) and impaired vascular resistance at a background of a reduced cardiovascular reserve. Measurements of absolute BV based on an on-line dilution method appear more promising than relative BV measurements in the prediction of IDH. Also, feedback treatments in which ultrafiltration rate is automatically adjusted based on changes in relative BV have not yet resulted in improvement. Frequent assessment of dry weight, attempting to reduce interdialytic weight gain and prescribing more frequent or longer dialysis treatments may aid in preventing IDH. The impaired vascular response can be improved using isothermic or cool dialysis treatment which has also been associated with a reduction in end organ damage, although their effect on mortality has not yet been assessed. For the future, identification of vulnerable patients based on artificial intelligence and on-line assessment of markers of organ perfusion may aid in individualizing treatment prescription, which will always remain dependent on the clinical context of the patient.

We modified the analytics software MOMO so that it flags laboratory results containing textual elements unknown to the thesaurus, and a human expert assigns the elements to the respective existing thesaurus elements or creates new ones. In 773,309 laboratory results, roughly 2.6% contained unassigned elements and would have been ignored in thesaurus-based analyses for purposes other than simply reporting microbiological findings to physicians. In current use, the thesaurus is kept up to date with synonyms, syntactic deviations, misspellings, and entries not contained earlier, with man-machine interaction of 2-3 hours per week. This approach helps to accommodate both up-to-date clinical reporting for immediate patient care as well as up-to-date queries for infection surveillance and epidemiology, outbreak management, quality control and benchmarking, and antimicrobial stewardship.

10.1016/j.burns.2018.10.027  |  Genetics, Prognosis  |  Genetics  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   After similar extent of injury there is considerable variability in scarring between individuals, in part due to genetic factors. This study aimed to identify genetic variants associated with scar height and pliability after burn injury. An exome-wide array association study and gene pathway analysis were performed on a prospective cohort of 665 patients treated for burn injury. Outcomes were scar height (SH) and scar pliability (SP) sub-scores of the modified Vancouver Scar Scale (mVSS). DNA was genotyped using the Infinium<sup>®</sup> HumanCoreExome-24 BeadChip. Associations between genetic variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and SH and SP were estimated using an additive genetic model adjusting for age, sex, number of surgical procedures and % total body surface area of burn in subjects of European ancestry. No individual genetic variants achieved the cut-off threshold of significance. Gene regions were analysed for spatially correlated single nucleotide polymorphisms and significant regions identified using comb-p software. This gene list was subject to gene pathway analysis to find which biological process terms were over-represented. Using this approach biological processes related to the nervous system and cell adhesion were the predominant gene pathways associated with both SH and SP. This study suggests genes associated with innervation may be important in scar fibrosis. Further studies using similar and larger datasets will be essential to validate these findings.

10.1186/s13058-018-1090-z  |  Genetics, Treatment  |  Prognosis, Treatment, Genetics  |  Support Vector Machine  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  BRCA1-mutated cancers exhibit deficient homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair, resulting in extensive copy number alterations and genome instability. HR deficiency can also arise in tumors without a BRCA1 mutation. Compared with other breast tumors, HR-deficient, BRCA1-like tumors exhibit worse prognosis but selective chemotherapeutic sensitivity. Presently, patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) who do not respond to hormone endocrine-targeting therapy are given cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, more recent evidence showed a similar genomic profile between BRCA1-deficient TNBCs and hormone-receptor-positive tumors. Characterization of the somatic alterations of BRCA1-like hormone-receptor-positive breast tumors as a group, which is currently lacking, can potentially help develop biomarkers for identifying additional patients who might respond to chemotherapy. 
  Methods:  We retrained and validated a copy-number-based support vector machine (SVM) classifier to identify HR-deficient, BRCA1-like breast tumors. We applied this classifier to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) breast tumors. We assessed mutational profiles and proliferative capacity by covariate-adjusted linear models and identified differentially methylated regions using DMRcate in BRCA1-like hormone-receptor-positive tumors. 
  Results:  Of the breast tumors in TCGA and METABRIC, 22% (651/2925) were BRCA1-like. Stratifying on hormone-receptor status, 13% (302/2405) receptor-positive and 69% (288/417) triple-negative tumors were BRCA1-like. Among the hormone-receptor-positive subgroup, BRCA1-like tumors showed significantly increased mutational burden and proliferative capacity (both P &lt; 0.05). Genome-scale DNA methylation analysis of BRCA1-like tumors identified 202 differentially methylated gene regions, including hypermethylated BRCA1. Individually significant CpGs were enriched for enhancer regions (P &lt; 0.05). The hypermethylated gene sets were enriched for DNA and chromatin conformation (all Bonferroni P &lt; 0.05). 
  Conclusions:  To provide insights into alternative classification and potential therapeutic targeting strategies of BRCA1-like hormone-receptor-positive tumors we developed and applied a novel copy number classifier to identify BRCA1-like hormone-receptor-positive tumors and their characteristic somatic alteration profiles.

10.1111/jch.13700  |  Prognosis  |  Prognosis, Treatment  |  Machine learning, Artificial Intelligence  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Review  |   Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) based on pattern recognition. There are different forms of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms that are being used to identify and predict blood pressure (BP) and other measures of cardiovascular risk. Since 1999, starting with neural network methods, ML has been used to gauge the relationship between BP and pulse wave forms. Since then, the scope of the research has expanded to using different cardiometabolic risk factors like BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio in concert with BP and its various pharmaceutical agents to estimate biochemical measures (like HDL cholesterol, LDL and total cholesterol, fibrinogen, and uric acid) as well as effectiveness of anti-hypertensive regimens. Data from large clinical trials like the SPRINT are being re-analyzed by ML methods to unearth new findings and identify unique relationships between predictors and outcomes. In summary, AI and ML methods are gaining immense attention in the management of chronic disease. Elevated BP is a very important early metric for the risk of development of cardiovascular and renal injury; therefore, advances in AI and ML will aid in early disease prediction and intervention.

However, the number of researches that tried to reveal the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in ESCC has been limited. LncRNAs are one of the important regulators of cancers which are transcribed dominantly in the genome and in various conditions. The main goal of this study was to use a systems biology approach to predict novel lncRNAs as well as protein coding genes associated with ESCC and assess their prognostic values. By using microarray expression data for mRNAs and lncRNAs from a large number of ESCC patients, we utilized "Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis" (WGCNA) method to make a big coding-non-coding gene co-expression network, and discovered important functional modules. Gene set enrichment and pathway analysis revealed major biological processes and pathways involved in these modules. After selecting some protein coding genes involved in biological processes and pathways related to cancer, we used "LncTar", a computational tool to predict potential interactions between these genes and lncRNAs. By combining interaction results with Pearson correlations, we introduced some novel lncRNAs with putative key regulatory roles in the network. Survival analysis with Kaplan-Meier estimator and Log-rank test statistic confirmed that most of the introduced genes are associated with poor prognosis in ESCC. Overall, our study reveals novel protein coding genes and lncRNAs associated with ESCC, along with their predicted interactions. Based on the promising results of survival analysis, these genes can be used as good estimators of patients' survival, or even can be analyzed further as new potential signatures or targets for the therapy of ESCC disease.

Functional image during the event can help to explore the mechanism. 
  Case report:  We report a finding of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in a 15-year-old female with SHM. She presented with recurrent right arm weakness and pain with migrainous headache. A video electroencephalogram showed no evidence of epilepsy during the events. Subtraction of ictal-interictal FDG-PET coregistered to magnetic resonance imaging was performed for the image analysis. In comparison with the interictal state, the FDG-PET image showed decreased glucose metabolism in the bilateral dorsal lateral frontal cortices and bilateral occipital cortices, whereas increased metabolism in the left precentral motor cortex and right premotor cortex. 
  Conclusion:  These findings reveal an increase in metabolism in the motor cortex during general cortical dysfunction in the frontal and occipital cortices in SHM. Key words: FDG-PET, hemiplegic migraine, migraine, positron emission tomography, SISCOM.

10.1063/1.5120106  |  None  |  None, Other  |  Reinforcement Learning, Q-learning algorithm  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   This paper addresses the consensus problem of discrete-time multiagent systems (DTMASs), which are subject to input saturation and lack of the information of agent dynamics. In the previous works, the DTMASs with input saturation can achieve semiglobal consensus by utilizing the low gain feedback (LGF) method, but computing the LGF matrices by solving the modified algebraic Riccati equation requires the knowledge of agent dynamics. In this paper, motivated by the reinforcement learning method, we propose a model-free Q-learning algorithm to obtain the LGF matrices for the DTMASs achieving global consensus. Firstly, we define a Q-learning function and deduce a Q-learning Bellman equation, whose solution can work out the LGF matrix. Then, we develop an iterative Q-learning algorithm to obtain the LGF matrix without the requirement of the knowledge about agent dynamics. Moreover, the DTMASs can achieve global consensus. Lastly, some simulation results are proposed to validate the effectiveness of the Q-learning algorithm and show the effect on the rate of convergence from the initial states of agents and the input saturation limit.

Molecular biomarkers may improve risk stratification for LUAD. 
  Methods:  We analyzed the gene expression profiles of LUAD patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We initially used three distinct algorithms (sigFeature, random forest, and univariate Cox regression) to evaluate each gene's prognostic relevance. Survival related genes were then fitted into the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model to build a risk prediction model for LUAD. After 100,000 times of calculation and model construction, a 16-gene-based prediction model capable of classifying LUAD patients into high-risk and low-risk groups was successfully built. 
  Results:  Using a combined strategy, we initially identified 2472 significant survival-related genes. Functional enrichment analysis demonstrated these genes' relevance to tumor initiation and progression. Using the LASSO method, we successfully built a reliable risk prediction model. The risk model was validated in two external sets and an independent set. The expression of these 16 genes was highly correlated with patients' risk. High-risk group patients witnessed poorer recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to low-risk group patients. Moreover, stratification analysis and decision curve analysis (DCA) confirmed the independence and potential translational value of this predictive tool. We also built a nomogram comprising risk model and stage to predict OS for LUAD patients. 
  Conclusions:  Our risk model may serve as a practical and reliable prognosis predictive tool for LUAD and could provide novel insights into the understanding of the molecular mechanism of this disease.

10.1016/j.ygeno.2018.05.016  |  Genetics  |  Diagnosis, Genetics  |   Markov Models, Artificial Intelligence  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   The fast and affordable sequencing of large clinical and environmental metagenomic datasets opens up new horizons in medical and biotechnological applications. It is believed that today we have described only about 1% of the microorganisms on the Earth, therefore, metagenomic analysis mostly deals with unknown species in the samples. Microbial communities in extreme environments may contain genes with high biotechnological potential, and clinical metagenomes, related to diseases, may uncover still unknown pathogens and pathological mechanisms in known diseases. While the species-level identification and description of the taxa in the samples do not seem to be possible today, we can search for novel genes with known functions in these samples, using numerous techniques, including artificial intelligence tools, like the hidden Markov models (HMMs). Here we describe a simple-to-use webserver, the MetaHMM, which is capable of homology-based automatic model-building for the genes to be searched for, and it also finds the closest matches in the metagenome. The webserver uses already highly successful building blocks: it performs multiple alignments by applying Clustal Omega, builds a hidden Markov model with HMMER components of hmmbuild and uses hmmsearch for finding similar sequences to the specified model in the metagenomes. The webserver is publicly available at https://metahmm.pitgroup.org.

In this article, both the efforts to create a united Europe and the achievements in dealing with esophageal atresia from the 1950s on are outlined. Furthermore, this paper deals with the future of pediatric surgery and is focused on two aspects: the "Fourth Industrial Revolution" which builds on the digital revolution, artificial intelligence and robotics, and its potential impact on pediatric surgery and the life of patients. I suggest that pediatric surgeons should participate and lead in the development of machine learning, data control, assuring appropriate use of machines, control misuse, and in particular ensure appropriate maintenance of ethical standards. Changes in health care structures within Europe, in particular the effect of centralization, will affect the concept of treatment for patients with rare diseases.

10.1371/journal.pone.0221460  |  Genetics  |  Prognosis, Genetics  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  The ripening process of olive fruits is associated with chemical and/or enzymatic specific transformations, making them particularly attractive to animals and humans. In olive drupes, including 'Cassanese' ones, ripening is usually accompanied by progressive chromatic change, resulting in a final red-brown colourization of both epidermis and mesocarp. This event has an exception in the 'Leucocarpa', in which we observed the destabilization in the equilibrium between the chlorophyll metabolism and that of the other pigments, particularly the anthocyanins, whose switch-off during maturation promotes the white colouration of the fruits. Recently, transcription profiling of 'Leucocarpa' and 'Cassanese' olives along ripening, performed through an Illumina RNA-seq approach, has provided useful insights on genes functions involved in fruit maturation such as those related to the biosynthesis of flavonoids and anthocyanins. 
  Methodology:  To assess expression alterations of genes involved in flavonoids and anthocyanins biosynthetic pathways during ripening, possibly caused by small nuclear RNA (snRNA) in olive drupes, snRNA libraries from 'Leucocarpa' and 'Cassanese' were constructed with RNAs extracted at 100 and 130 Days After Flowering (DAF) and sequenced by an Illumina approach. 130 conserved microRNAs (miRNA) in the Viridiplantae belonging to 14 miRNA families were identified. Regarding the 130 conserved miRNAs, approximately the 48% were identified in all libraries, 5 and 18 miRNAs were shared between the "Cassanese" (C100, C130) and "Leucocarpa" (L100, L130) libraries, respectively. 
  Conclusion:  For the remaining reads not-matching with known miRNAs in the Viridiplantae, we combined secondary structure and minimum free energy to discover novel olive miRNAs. Based on these analyses, 492 sequences were considered as putative novel miRNAs. The putative target genes of identified miRNA were computationally predicted by alignment with the olive drupe transcripts obtained from the same samples. A total of 218 transcripts were predicted as targets of 130 known and 492 putative novel miRNAs. Interestingly, some identified target genes are involved in negative regulation of anthocyanin metabolic process. Quantification of the expression pattern of three miRNA and their target transcripts by qRT-PCR assay confirmed the results of Illumina sequencing.

Existing computational methods for peptide-display focus on modeling the peptide-MHC-binding affinity. However, such models are not able to characterize the sequence features for the other cellular processes in the peptide display pathway that determines MHC ligand selection. 
  Results:  We introduce a semi-supervised model, DeepLigand that outperforms the state-of-the-art models in MHC Class I ligand prediction. DeepLigand combines a peptide language model and peptide binding affinity prediction to score MHC class I peptide presentation. The peptide language model characterizes sequence features that correspond to secondary factors in MHC ligand selection other than binding affinity. The peptide embedding is learned by pre-training on natural ligands, and can discriminate between ligands and non-ligands in the absence of binding affinity prediction. Although conventional affinity-based models fail to classify peptides with moderate affinities, DeepLigand discriminates ligands from non-ligands with consistently high accuracy. 
  Availability and implementation:  We make DeepLigand available at https://github.com/gifford-lab/DeepLigand.

PMID:30919611  |  Smart Healthcare  |  Smart Healthcare  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Research  |   The digital universe remains a black box. Despite attaining high-technology capabilities like artificial intelligence and cognitive computing, "Big Data" analytics have failed to keep pace with surging data production. At the same time, the falling costs of cloud storage and distributed systems have made mass data storage cheaper and more accessible. These effects have produced a chasm between data that is stored and data that can be readily analyzed and understood. Enticed by the promise of extracting future value from rising data stockpiles, organizations now retain massive quantities of data that they cannot presently know or effectively manage. This rising sea of "dark data" now represents the vast majority of the digital universe. Dark data presents a quandary for organizations and the judicial system. For organizations, the inability to know the contents of retained dark data produces invisible risk under a spreading patchwork of digital privacy and data governance laws, most notably in the medical and consumer protection areas. For courts increasingly confronted with Big Data-derived evidence, dark data may shield critical information from judicial view while embedding subjective influences within seemingly objective methods. To avoid obscuring organizational risk and producing erroneous outcomes in the courtroom, decision-makers must achieve a new awareness of dark data’s presence and its ability to undermine Big Data’s vaunted advantages.

10.1371/journal.pone.0207191  |  None  |  None, Other  |  Mobile Augmented Reality  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Research  |   Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) requires a descriptor that is robust to changes in viewing conditions in real time application. Many different descriptors had been proposed in the literature for example floating-point descriptors (SIFT and SURF) and binary descriptors (BRIEF, ORB, BRISK and FREAK). According to literature, floating-point descriptors are not suitable for real-time application because its operating speed does not satisfy real-time constraints. Binary descriptors have been developed with compact sizes and lower computation requirements. However, it is unclear which binary descriptors are more appropriate for MAR. Hence, a distinctive and efficient accuracy measurement of four state-of-the-art binary descriptors, namely, BRIEF, ORB, BRISK and FREAK were performed using the Mikolajczyk dataset and ALOI dataset to identify the most appropriate descriptor for MAR in terms of computation time and robustness to brightness, scale and rotation changes. The obtained results showed that FREAK is the most appropriate descriptor for MAR application as it able to produce an application that are efficient (shortest computation time) and robust towards scale, rotation and brightness changes.

For sets of protein-coding genes, ontology and pathway analyses are powerful tools for generating new insights from statistical enrichment of gene features. Here we present the LnCompare web server, an equivalent resource for studying the properties of lncRNA gene sets. The Gene Set Feature Comparison mode tests for enrichment amongst a panel of quantitative and categorical features, spanning gene structure, evolutionary conservation, expression, subcellular localization, repetitive sequences and disease association. Moreover, in Similar Gene Identification mode, users may identify other lncRNAs by similarity across a defined range of features. Comprehensive results may be downloaded in tabular and graphical formats, in addition to the entire feature resource. LnCompare will empower researchers to extract useful hypotheses and candidates from lncRNA gene sets.

10.3390/s19040833  |  Smart Healthcare  |  Smart Healthcare  |  Internet of Things  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   The traditional Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has evolved towards intelligent IoT applications which exploit knowledge produced by IoT devices using artificial intelligence techniques. Knowledge sharing between IoT devices is a challenging issue in this trend. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge of Things (KoT) framework which enables sharing self-taught knowledge between IoT devices which require similar or identical knowledge without help from the cloud. The proposed KoT framework allows an IoT device to effectively produce, cumulate, and share its self-taught knowledge with other devices at the edge in the vicinity. This framework can alleviate behavioral repetition in users and computational redundancy in systems in intelligent IoT applications. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concept, we examine a smart home case study and build a prototype of the KoT framework-based smart home system. Experimental results show that the proposed KoT framework reduces the response time to use intelligent IoT devices from a user's perspective and the power consumption for compuation from a system's perspective.

10.1021/acs.est.8b06586  |  None  |  Treatment  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   In recent years, several methods have emerged to estimate the emissions and health, environmental, and climate change damages avoided by interventions such as energy efficiency, demand response, and the integration of renewables. However, differing assumptions employed in these analyses could yield contradicting recommendations regarding intervention implementation. We test the magnitude of the effect of using different key assumptions-average vs marginal emissions, year of calculation, temporal and regional scope, and inclusion of nonemitting generation-to estimate Mid-Atlantic region power pool (PJM) emissions and damage factors. We further highlight the importance of factor selection by evaluating three illustrative 2017 power system examples in PJM. We find that for a simple building lighting intervention, using average emissions factors incorporating nonemitting generation <i>underestimates</i> avoided damages by 45% compared to marginal factors. For PJM demand response, outdated marginal emissions factors from 2016 <i>overestimate</i> avoided damages by 25% compared to 2017 factors. Our assessment of PJM summer load further suggests that fossil-only average emissions factors <i>overestimate</i> damages by 63% compared to average factors incorporating nonemitting generation. We recommend that energy modelers carefully select appropriate emissions metrics when performing their analyses. Furthermore, since the U.S. electric grid is rapidly changing, we urge decision-makers to frequently update (and consider forecasting) grid emissions factors.

10.1103/PhysRevE.100.012201  |  None  |  Prognosis  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   We investigate here how the optical properties at low frequencies affect the actuation dynamics and emerging chaotic behavior in a double-beam torsion actuator at nanoscale separations (&lt;200nm), where the Casimir forces and torques play a major role. In fact, we take into account differences of the Casimir force due to alternative modeling of optical properties at low frequencies, where measurements are not feasible, via the Drude and plasma models, and repercussions by different material preparation conditions. For conservative autonomous actuation, bifurcation and phase portrait analysis indicate that both factors affect the stability of an actuating device in such a way that stronger Casimir forces and torques will favor increased unstable behavior. The latter will be enhanced by unbalanced application of electrostatic voltages in double-beam actuating systems. For the case of a time-periodic driving force, we use a Melnikov function and a phase plane analysis to study the emerging chaotic behavior with respect to the Drude and plasma modeling and material preparation conditions. We find indications that any factor that leads to stronger Casimir interactions will aid chaotic behavior and prevent long term prediction of the actuating dynamics. Moreover, in a double-beam actuator chaoticity will be amplified by the application of unbalanced electrostatic voltages. Therefore, the details of modeling of optical properties and the material preparations conditions must be carefully considered in the design of actuating devices at nanoscale because here Casimir forces are omnipresent and broadband type interactions.

10.1186/s12911-019-0856-2  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Genetics  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Genetics  |  Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Padua linear model is widely used for the risk assessment of venous thromboembolism (VTE), a common but preventable complication for inpatients. However, genetic and environmental differences between Western and Chinese population limit the validity of Padua model in Chinese patients. Medical records which contain rich information about disease progression, are useful in mining new risk factors related to Chinese VTE patients. Furthermore, machine learning (ML) methods provide new opportunities to build precise risk prediction model by automatic selection of risk factors based on original medical records. 
  Methods:  Medical records of 3,106 inpatients including 224 VTE patients were collected and various types of ontologies were integrated to parse unstructured text. A workflow of ontology-based VTE risk prediction model, that combines natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) technologies, was proposed. Firstly ontology terms were extracted from medical records, then sorted according to their calculated weights. Next importance of each term in the unit of section was evaluated and finally a ML model was built based on a subset of terms. Four ML methods were tested, and the best model was decided by comparing area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). 
  Results:  Medical records were first split into different sections and subsequently, terms from each section were sorted by their weights calculated by multiple types of information. Greedy selection algorithm was used to obtain significant sections and terms. Top terms in each section were selected to construct patients' distributed representations by word embedding technique. Using top 300 terms of two important sections, namely the 'Progress Note' section and 'Admitting Diagnosis' section, the model showed relatively better predictive performance. Then ML model which utilizes a subset of terms from two sections, about 110 terms, achieved the best AUC score, of 0.973 ± 0.006, which was significantly better compared to the Padua's performance of 0.791 ± 0.022. Terms found by the model showed their potential to help clinicians explore new risk factors. 
  Conclusions:  In this study, a new VTE risk assessment model based on ontologies extraction from raw medical records is developed and its performance is verified on real clinical dataset. Results of selected terms can help clinicians to discover meaningful risk factors.

Despite this, lung cancer screening (LCS) remains challenging. In the context of a global shortage of radiologists, the high rate of false-positive LDCT results in overloading of existing lung cancer clinics and multidisciplinary teams. Thus, to provide patients with earlier access to life-saving surgical interventions, there is an urgent need to improve LDCT-based LCS and especially to reduce the false-positive rate that plagues the current detection technology. In this context, LCS can be improved in three ways: (1) by refining selection criteria (risk factor assessment), (2) by using Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) to make it easier to interpret chest CTs, and (3) by using biological blood signatures for early cancer detection, to both spot the optimal target population and help classify lung nodules. These three main ways of improving LCS are discussed in this review.

Post-industrialized countries are particularly prone to an ever-increasing number of ageing individuals and ageing-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases are associated with volume loss in the affected brain. MRI diagnoses and monitoring of subtle volume changes in the ageing/diseased brains have the potential to become standard diagnostic tools. Even with the superior resolution of 7 T MRI scanners, the microstructural changes comprising cell types, cell numbers, and cellular processes, are still undetectable. Knowledge of origin, nature, and progression for microstructural changes are necessary to understand pathogenetic stages in the relentless neurodegenerative diseases, as well as to develop therapeutic tools that delay or stop neurodegenerative processes at their earliest stage. We illustrate the gap in resolution by comparing the identical regions of the post-mortem in situ 7 T MR images (virtual autopsy or virtopsy) with the histological observations in serial sections through the same brain. We also described the protocols and limitations associated with these comparisons, as well as the necessity of supercomputers and data management for "Big data". Analysis of neuron and/or glial number by using a body of mathematical tools and guidelines (stereology) is time-consuming, cumbersome, and still restricted to trained human investigators. Development of tools based on machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) could considerably accelerate studies on localization, onset, and progression of neuron loss. Finally, these observations could disentangle the mechanisms of volume loss into stages of reversible atrophy and/or irreversible fatal cell death. This AI- and ML-based cooperation between virtopsy and histology could bridge the present gap between virtual reality and neuropathology. It could also culminate in the creation of an imaging-associated comprehensive database. This database would include genetic, clinical, epidemiological, and technical aspects that could help to alleviate or even stop the adverse effects of neurodegenerative diseases on affected individuals, their families, and society.

10.1073/pnas.1900949116  |  Smart Healthcare  |  Prognosis  |  Artificial Intelligence, Automation Technologies  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Research  |   Rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and automation technologies have the potential to significantly disrupt labor markets. While AI and automation can augment the productivity of some workers, they can replace the work done by others and will likely transform almost all occupations at least to some degree. Rising automation is happening in a period of growing economic inequality, raising fears of mass technological unemployment and a renewed call for policy efforts to address the consequences of technological change. In this paper we discuss the barriers that inhibit scientists from measuring the effects of AI and automation on the future of work. These barriers include the lack of high-quality data about the nature of work (e.g., the dynamic requirements of occupations), lack of empirically informed models of key microlevel processes (e.g., skill substitution and human-machine complementarity), and insufficient understanding of how cognitive technologies interact with broader economic dynamics and institutional mechanisms (e.g., urban migration and international trade policy). Overcoming these barriers requires improvements in the longitudinal and spatial resolution of data, as well as refinements to data on workplace skills. These improvements will enable multidisciplinary research to quantitatively monitor and predict the complex evolution of work in tandem with technological progress. Finally, given the fundamental uncertainty in predicting technological change, we recommend developing a decision framework that focuses on resilience to unexpected scenarios in addition to general equilibrium behavior.

Impaired inhibition has been related to dopamine overdosing of the associative striatum. We compared effects of dopaminergic medication on inhibitory control in patients with young (age at onset &lt;50 years, YOPD) and late onset PD (LOPD) and related them to nigrostriatal degeneration. 
  Methods:  27 patients (10 YOPD, 17 LOPD) underwent a Go/NoGo paradigm comprising a global and specific NoGo condition ON and OFF DA. The ratio of dopamine transporter availability (DAT) in the associative relative to the sensorimotor striatum according to [<sup>123</sup>I]FP-CIT SPECT was compared between YOPD and LOPD (n = 8/12). Neuro-computational modeling was used to identify pathway activation during Go/NoGo performance. 
  Results:  Patients made more errors ON compared to OFF in the global NoGo. This DA effect on global NoGo errors correlated with disease duration (r = 0.489, p = 0.010). YOPD made more errors in the specific NoGo ON-OFF compared to LOPD (p = 0.015). YOPD showed higher associative-to-sensorimotor DAT ratios compared to LOPD (p &lt; 0.001). Neuro-computational modeling revealed DA overdosing of the associative striatum in YOPD resulting in excess activation of the direct basal ganglia pathway triggering incorrect responses. 
  Conclusions:  Depending on the age of symptom onset, DA differentially modulated inhibition in PD with detrimental effects on specific NoGo performance in YOPD but increased performance in LOPD. YOPD showed relatively less degeneration in the associative striatum suggesting DA overdosing that is supported by our neuro-computational model. Reduced inhibition in the global NoGo condition suggests different pathway activation.

Each patient history is discussed by well-known neurologists, neurosurgeons, and neuropathologists. Review of these cases provides a framework to explore diagnostic shifts that have occurred over the past half century. Importantly, while the discussants of these cases were great diagnosticians, they were somewhat limited by the methods available to them at the time; subsequent novel technologies provided opportunities for new insights that were made by the next generation of experts. Today's pathologists (whether neuropathologists or any other pathology subspecialists) are similarly skilled at diagnosis, although their diagnoses are now more often made on biopsies (rather than autopsies) and informed by pre-operative imaging studies as well as post-operative molecular analyses. In turn, one would conclude that, even in the face of future technological changes brought about by disruptive innovations like artificial intelligence and deep molecular analyses, a need will continue for the expertise of pathologists and other clinical diagnosticians.

However, mesopic and dark-adapted two-color fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP, also called "microperimetry") constitute laborious examinations. We have devised a machine-learning-based approach to predict mesopic and dark-adapted (DA) retinal sensitivity in eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). Extensive psychophysical testing and volumetric multimodal retinal imaging data were acquired including mesopic, DA red and DA cyan FCP, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography and confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy infrared reflectance and fundus autofluorescence imaging. With patient-wise leave-one-out cross-validation, we have been able to achieve prediction accuracies of (mean absolute error, MAE [95% CI]) 3.94 dB [3.38, 4.5] for mesopic, 4.93 dB [4.59, 5.27] for DA cyan and 4.02 dB [3.63, 4.42] for DA red testing. Partial addition of patient-specific sensitivity data decreased the cross-validated MAE to 2.8 dB [2.51, 3.09], 3.71 dB [3.46, 3.96], and 2.85 dB [2.62, 3.08]. The most important predictive feature was outer nuclear layer thickness. This artificial intelligence-based analysis strategy, termed "inferred sensitivity", herein, enables to estimate differential effects of retinal structural abnormalities on cone- and rod-function in nAMD, and may be used as quasi-functional surrogate endpoint in future clinical trials.

The simulation results of biological learning algorithms presented herein outperform state-of-the-art optimal learning curves in supervised learning of feedforward networks. The biological learning algorithms comprise asynchronous input signals with decaying input summation, weights adaptation, and multiple outputs for an input signal. In particular, the generalization error for such biological perceptrons decreases rapidly with increasing number of examples, and it is independent of the size of the input. This is achieved using either synaptic learning, or solely through dendritic adaptation with a mechanism of swinging between reflecting boundaries, without learning steps. The proposed biological learning algorithms outperform the optimal scaling of the learning curve in a traditional perceptron. It also results in a considerable robustness to disparity between weights of two networks with very similar outputs in biological supervised learning scenarios. The simulation results indicate the potency of neurobiological mechanisms and open opportunities for developing a superior class of deep learning algorithms.

This article seeks to provide an overview and a prospective of radiology fellows in their last year of training about the current trends and policy tools for promoting mobility among young radiologists, especially inside the European Union. Nowadays, the need to promote international cooperation is even greater to ensure that the best evidence-based medical practices become a common background of a next cross-border generation of radiologists. Organisations such as the European Society of Radiology (ESR) and the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) are called upon to play as guarantors of the training of young radiologists building know-how and world-class excellence. Today, it is not just being certified radiologist that matters, the place where the training was done plays an important role in enhancing chances when applying for a high-level job or fellowship. The article argues that the mobility of radiology trainees is an indispensable prerequisite to face new challenges, including the application of artificial intelligence to medical imaging, which will require a large multicentre collaboration.

10.12688/gatesopenres.12999.1  |  Treatment, Prognosis  |  Treatment  |  Text Mining, Artificial Intelligence  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   <b>Background</b>: Text message-based interventions have been shown to have consistently positive effects on health improvement and behavior change. Some studies suggest that personalization, tailoring, and interactivity can increase efficacy. With the rise in artificial intelligence and its incorporation into interventions, there is an opportunity to rethink how these characteristics are designed for greater effect. A key step in this process is to better understand how users engage with interventions. In this paper, we apply a text mining approach to characterize the ways that Kenyan men and women communicated with the first iterations of <i>askNivi</i>, a free sexual and reproductive health information service. <b>Methods</b>: We tokenized and processed more than 179,000 anonymized messages that users exchanged with live agents, enabling us to count word frequency overall, by sex, and by age/sex cohorts. We also conducted two manual coding exercises: (1) We manually classified the intent of 3,834 user messages in a training dataset; and (2) We manually coded all conversations between a random subset of 100 users who engaged in extended chats. <b>Results</b>: Between September 2017 and January 2019, 28,021 users (mean age 22.5 years, 63% female) sent 87,180 messages to <i>askNivi,</i> and 18 agents sent 92,429 replies. Users wrote most often about family planning methods, contraception, side effects, pregnancy, menstruation, and sex, but we observed different patterns by sex and age. User intents largely reflected the marketing focus on reproductive health, but other topics emerged. Most users sought factual information, but requests for advice and symptom reports were common. <b>Conclusions</b>: Young people in Kenya have a great desire for accurate and reliable information on health and wellbeing, which is easy to access and trustworthy. Text mining is one way to better understand how users engage with interventions like <i>askNivi</i> and maximize what artificial intelligence has to offer.

10.1039/c9an00964g  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis  |  Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Deep learning  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Review  |   Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) is a critical choice for applications of point-of-care testing (POCT) in clinical and laboratory environments because of its excellent features and versatility. To obtain authentic values of analyte concentrations and reliable detection results, the relevant research has featured the application of a diversity of methods of mathematical analysis to technical analysis to allow for use with a small quantity of data. Accordingly, a number of signal and image processing strategies have also emerged for the application of gold immunochromatographic and fluorescent strips to improve sensitivity and overcome the limitations of correlative hardware systems. Instead of traditional methods to solve the problem, researchers nowadays are interested in machine learning and its more powerful variant, deep learning technology, for LFIA detection. This review emphasizes different models for the POCT of accurate labels as well as signal processing strategies that use artificial intelligence and machine learning. We focus on the analytical mechanism, procedural flow, and the results of the assay, and conclude by summarizing the advantages and limitations of each algorithm. We also discuss the potential for application of and directions of future research on LFIA technology when combined with Artificial Intelligence and deep learning.

10.1007/s10071-019-01277-y  |  Genetics  |  Diagnosis  |  Artificial Grammar Learning  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Strategies used in artificial grammar learning can shed light into the abilities of different species to extract regularities from the environment. In the A(X)<sup>n</sup>B rule, A and B items are linked, but assigned to different positional categories and separated by distractor items. Open questions are how widespread is the ability to extract positional regularities from A(X)<sup>n</sup>B patterns, which strategies are used to encode positional regularities and whether individuals exhibit preferences for absolute or relative position encoding. We used visual arrays to investigate whether cotton-top tamarins (Saguinusoedipus) can learn this rule and which strategies they use. After training on a subset of exemplars, two of the tested monkeys successfully generalized to novel combinations. These tamarins discriminated between categories of tokens with different properties (A, B, X) and detected a positional relationship between non-adjacent items even in the presence of novel distractors. The pattern of errors revealed that successful subjects used visual similarity with training stimuli to solve the task and that successful tamarins extracted the relative position of As and Bs rather than their absolute position, similarly to what has been observed in other species. Relative position encoding appears to be favoured in different tasks and taxa. Generalization, though, was incomplete, since we observed a failure with items that during training had always been presented in reinforced arrays, showing the limitations in grasping the underlying positional rule. These results suggest the use of local strategies in the extraction of positional rules in cotton-top tamarins.

10.1016/j.ultsonch.2019.104646  |  Genetics  |  Prognosis, Genetics  |  Genetic Programming, Artificial Neural Networks  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   The present study has focused on performance analysis of ultrasound-assisted synthesized nano-hierarchical silico-alumino-phosphate-34 (SAPO-34) catalyst during methanol-to-light-olefins (MTO) process. A classical method, i.e., multiple linear regression (MLR) and two intelligent methods, i.e., genetic programming (GP) and artificial neural networks (ANN) were used for modeling of the performance of nano-hierarchical SAPO-34 catalyst. We studied the influence of basic parameters for the sonochemical synthesis of nano-hierarchical SAPO-34 catalyst such as crystallization time, ultrasonic irradiation time, ultrasonic intensity, amount of organic template (diethylamine (DEA) and carbon nanotube (CNT)) on its performance (methanol conversion and light olefins selectivity) in MTO process. The results revealed that the models achieved using the GP method had the highest accuracy for training and test data. Therefore, GP models were used in the following to predict the effect of main parameters for the sonochemical synthesis of nano-hierarchical SAPO-34 catalyst. Finally, an optimal catalyst with the highest yield into light olefins was predicted using the genetic optimization algorithm. The genetic models were employed as an evaluation function in the genetic algorithm (GA). A good agreement between the outputs of GP models for the optimal catalyst and experimental results were obtained. The optimal ultrasound-assisted synthesized nano-hierarchical SAPO-34 was accompanied by light olefins selectivity of 77% and methanol conversion of 94% from the onset of the process after 9 h.

  Methods:  From December 2015 to December 2017, 127 patients with rectal cancer were prospectively enrolled and divided into training and validation sets. Endorectal ultrasound (ERUS) and shear-wave elastography (SWE) examinations were conducted for each patient. A total of 4176 US radiomics features were extracted for each patient. After the reduction and selection of US radiomics features , a predictive model using an artificial neural network (ANN) was constructed in the training set. Furthermore, two models (one incorporating clinical information and one based on MRI radiomics) were developed. These models were validated by assessing their diagnostic performance and comparing the areas under the curve (AUCs) in the validation set. 
  Results:  The training and validation sets included 29 (33.3%) and 11 (27.5%) patients with TDs, respectively. A US radiomics ANN model was constructed. The model for predicting TDs showed an accuracy of 75.0% in the validation cohort. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and AUC were 72.7%, 75.9%, 53.3%, 88.0% and 0.743, respectively. For the model incorporating clinical information, the AUC improved to 0.795. Although the AUC of the US radiomics model was improved compared with that of the MRI radiomics model (0.916 vs. 0.872) in the 90 patients with both ultrasound and MRI data (which included both the training and validation sets), the difference was nonsignificant (p = 0.384). 
  Conclusions:  US radiomics may be a potential model to accurately predict TDs before therapy. 
  Key points:  • We prospectively developed an artificial neural network model for predicting tumour deposits based on US radiomics that had an accuracy of 75.0%. • The area under the curve of the US radiomics model was improved than that of the MRI radiomics model (0.916 vs. 0.872), but the difference was not significant (p = 0.384). • The US radiomics-based model may potentially predict TDs accurately before therapy, but this model needs further validation with larger samples.

10.1016/j.apradiso.2019.108856  |  None  |  None, Other  |  Artificial Neural Networks  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Neutron fluence and neutron ambient dose equivalent, H<sup>*</sup>(10), are important physical quantities for neutron radiation protection and monitoring. They can be deduced from neutron spectrum, which is usually measured by multisphere system with proper unfolding methods. Novel unfolding methods on the basis of artificial intelligence, mainly artificial neural networks (ANNs), have been researched and developed. However, without normalization on network inputs, ANNs can not be applied to accommodate demands of various neutron field measurements for neutron spectrum unfolding in practice, because the neutron spectra for training the ANNs are mostly extracted from IAEA (2001), the integrals of which over neutron energy are unit fluences. Moreover, derived from an unfolded normalized spectrum, the true values of neutron fluence and H<sup>*</sup>(10) are never to know. In this work, three normalization methods-zero-mean normalization method, min-max normalization method, and maximum-divided normalization method were used to process with the inputs of generalized regression neural networks (GRNNs), and a new method was proposed for neutron fluence and H<sup>*</sup>(10) estimations derived from unfolded neutron spectrum based on GRNNs for the first time. Sixty-three neutron spectra were unfolded based on GRNNs with use of three normalization methods, and the corresponding neutron fluences and H<sup>*</sup>(10) were obtained and compared. From the testing results, the GRNNs with the maximum-divided method is most effective to unfold neutron spectrum and to evaluate neutron fluence and H<sup>*</sup>(10). The feasibility of the method was further studied through experiments by using Bonner sphere spectrometer in well characterized <sup>241</sup>Am-Be neutron field.

The UEG Research Committee initiated a survey of the current and future research interests of each individual UEG ordinary member society (specialist societies). 
  Methods:  A questionnaire was sent by mail to 17 UEG ordinary member societies asking them to specify research demands related to the most urgent medical need including basic science research, translational research, clinical research, patient management research and research on disease prevention, in an open fashion but with limited word count. 
  Results:  The responses from 13 societies were analysed in a semi-quantitative and in a qualitative way, and were clustered into five domains with two aspects each that were consented and shared between three and seven of the responding 13 societies. These clusters resemble topics such as 'Hot topics' (e.g. life-style, nutrition, microbial-host interaction), Biomarkers (genetic profiling, gut-brain interaction), Advanced technology (artificial intelligence, personalised medicine), Global research tools (bio-banking, EU trials), and Medical training (education, prevention). 
  Conclusion:  The generated topic list allows both collaboration between individual specialist societies as well as initiating and fostering future research calls at the EU level and beyond when approaching stakeholders.

Considering gene expressions are usually highly correlated in humans, the expression values of the remaining target genes can be predicted by analyzing the values of 943 landmark genes. Hence, we designed an algorithm for predicting gene expression values based on XGBoost, which integrates multiple tree models and has stronger interpretability. We tested the performance of XGBoost model on the GEO dataset and RNA-seq dataset and compared the result with other existing models. Experiments showed that the XGBoost model achieved a significantly lower overall error than the existing D-GEX algorithm, linear regression, and KNN methods. In conclusion, the XGBoost algorithm outperforms existing models and will be a significant contribution to the toolbox for gene expression value prediction.

I discuss these concepts using examples from past and ongoing research in brain connectivity, brain information flow, information extraction from large-scale neuroimaging data, and neural predictive modeling. Having dispensed with the past, I attempt to present a few areas where statistical science facilitates brain decoding and to write prospectively, in the light of present knowledge and in the quest for artificial intelligence, about questions that statistical and neurobiological communities could work closely together to address in the future.

However, due to the speed of these developments the quality standards of the involved data analyses are lacking behind, as exemplified by the infamous Duke Saga.

Screening and visual diagnosis that are currently performed in clinics possibly cost a lot in various manners. Along with the progress of the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence, the internet-based intelligent system have shown great potential in applying home-based healthcare. Therefore, a smart dental health-IoT system based on intelligent hardware, deep learning, and mobile terminal is proposed in this paper, aiming at exploring the feasibility of its application on in-home dental healthcare. Moreover, a smart dental device is designed and developed in this study to perform the image acquisition of teeth. Based on the data set of 12 600 clinical images collected by the proposed device from 10 private dental clinics, an automatic diagnosis model trained by MASK R-CNN is developed for the detection and classification of 7 different dental diseases including decayed tooth, dental plaque, uorosis, and periodontal disease, with the diagnosis accuracy of them reaching up to 90%, along with high sensitivity and high specificity. Following the one-month test in ten clinics, compared with that last month when the platform was not used, the mean diagnosis time reduces by 37.5% for each patient, helping explain the increase in the number of treated patients by 18.4%. Furthermore, application software (APPs) on mobile terminal for client side and for dentist side are implemented to provide service of pre-examination, consultation, appointment, and evaluation.

They are powerful tools for large scale data analysis, prediction and classification, especially in very data-rich environments ("big data"), and have started to find their way into medical applications. Here we will first give an overview of machine learning methods, with a focus on deep and recurrent neural networks, their relation to statistics, and the core principles behind them. We will then discuss and review directions along which (deep) neural networks can be, or already have been, applied in the context of psychiatry, and will try to delineate their future potential in this area. We will also comment on an emerging area that so far has been much less well explored: by embedding semantically interpretable computational models of brain dynamics or behavior into a statistical machine learning context, insights into dysfunction beyond mere prediction and classification may be gained. Especially this marriage of computational models with statistical inference may offer insights into neural and behavioral mechanisms that could open completely novel avenues for psychiatric treatment.

To achieve this, artificial neural networks (ANN)-successful and widely used machine learning algorithms-have been demonstrated to be potentially powerful tools, providing acceptable location detection accuracy of 95.2% and force level recognition of 93.3% in a previous study. While these values might be acceptable for conventional operations, e.g., opening a folder, they must be boosted for applications where intensive operations are performed. Furthermore, the relatively high computational cost reported prevents the popularity of ANN-based techniques in conventional artificial intelligence (AI) chip-free end-terminals. In this article, an ANN is designed and optimized for piezoelectric-based touch panels in interactive displays for the first time. The presented technique experimentally allows a conventional smart device to work smoothly with a high detection accuracy of above 97% for both location and force level detection with a low computational cost, thereby advancing the user experience, and serviced by piezoelectric-based touch interfaces in displays.

10.1007/s11948-019-00084-5  |  None  |  Robotics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Review  |   This paper examines the ethical pitfalls and challenges that non-ethicists, such as researchers and programmers in the fields of computer science, artificial intelligence and robotics, face when building moral machines. Whether ethics is "computable" depends on how programmers understand ethics in the first place and on the adequacy of their understanding of the ethical problems and methodological challenges in these fields. Researchers and programmers face at least two types of problems due to their general lack of ethical knowledge or expertise. The first type is so-called rookie mistakes, which could be addressed by providing these people with the necessary ethical knowledge. The second, more difficult methodological issue concerns areas of peer disagreement in ethics, where no easy solutions are currently available. This paper examines several existing approaches to highlight the ethical pitfalls and challenges involved. Familiarity with these and similar problems can help programmers to avoid pitfalls and build better moral machines. The paper concludes that ethical decisions regarding moral robots should be based on avoiding what is immoral (i.e. prohibiting certain immoral actions) in combination with a pluralistic ethical method of solving moral problems, rather than relying on a particular ethical approach, so as to avoid a normative bias.

Nevertheless, much remains to be learned, as a complex interplay of processes with dependencies on a range of genomic features creates highly heterogeneous cancer genomes. Accurate driver detection relies on unbiased models of the mutation rate that also capture rate variation from uncharacterized sources. 
  Results:  Here, we analyse patterns of observed-to-expected mutation counts across 505 whole cancer genomes, and find that genomic features missing from our mutation-rate model likely operate on a megabase length scale. We extend our site-specific model of the mutation rate to include the additional variance from these sources, which leads to robust significance evaluation of candidate cancer drivers. We thus present ncdDetect v.2, with greatly improved cancer driver detection specificity. Finally, we show that ranking candidates by their posterior mean value of their effect sizes offers an equivalent and more computationally efficient alternative to ranking by their P-values.

We previously developed a calibration method for stochastic epidemic compartmental models, called Multiple Shooting for Stochastic Systems (MSS), and demonstrated its competitive performance against a number of existing state-of-the-art calibration methods. The existing MSS method, however, lacks a mechanism against filter degeneracy, a phenomenon that results in parameter posterior distributions that are weighted heavily around a single value. As such, when filter degeneracy occurs, the posterior distributions of parameter estimates will not yield reliable credible or prediction intervals for parameter estimates and predictions. In this work, we extend the MSS method by evaluating and incorporating two resampling techniques to detect and resolve filter degeneracy. Using simulation experiments, we demonstrate that an extended MSS method produces credible and prediction intervals with desired coverage in estimating key epidemic parameters (e.g. mean duration of infectiousness and <i>R</i><sub>0</sub>) and short- and long-term predictions (e.g. one and three-week forecasts, timing and number of cases at the epidemic peak, and final epidemic size). Applying the extended MSS approach to a humidity-based stochastic compartmental influenza model, we were able to accurately predict influenza-like illness activity reported by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 10 regions as well as city-level influenza activity using real-time, city-specific Google search query data from 119 U.S. cities between 2003 and 2014.

10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007342  |  Epidemiology, Prognosis  |  Prognosis, Epidemiology  |  EMULSION -Software  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Stochastic mechanistic epidemiological models largely contribute to better understand pathogen emergence and spread, and assess control strategies at various scales (from within-host to transnational scale). However, developing realistic models which involve multi-disciplinary knowledge integration faces three major challenges in predictive epidemiology: lack of readability once translated into simulation code, low reproducibility and reusability, and long development time compared to outbreak time scale. We introduce here EMULSION, an artificial intelligence-based software intended to address those issues and help modellers focus on model design rather than programming. EMULSION defines a domain-specific language to make all components of an epidemiological model (structure, processes, parameters…) explicit as a structured text file. This file is readable by scientists from other fields (epidemiologists, biologists, economists), who can contribute to validate or revise assumptions at any stage of model development. It is then automatically processed by EMULSION generic simulation engine, preventing any discrepancy between model description and implementation. The modelling language and simulation architecture both rely on the combination of advanced artificial intelligence methods (knowledge representation and multi-level agent-based simulation), allowing several modelling paradigms (from compartment- to individual-based models) at several scales (up to metapopulation). The flexibility of EMULSION and its capability to support iterative modelling are illustrated here through examples of progressive complexity, including late revisions of core model assumptions. EMULSION is also currently used to model the spread of several diseases in real pathosystems. EMULSION provides a command-line tool for checking models, producing model diagrams, running simulations, and plotting outputs. Written in Python 3, EMULSION runs on Linux, MacOS, and Windows. It is released under Apache-2.0 license. A comprehensive documentation with installation instructions, a tutorial and many examples are available from: https://sourcesup.renater.fr/www/emulsion-public.

  Results:  Here, we introduce a machine learning method with chemical fingerprint-based features for the prediction of the Gibbs free energy of biochemical reactions. From a large pool of 2D fingerprint-based features, this method systematically selects a small number of relevant ones and uses them to construct a regularized linear model. Since a manual selection of 2D structure-based features can be a tedious and time-consuming task, requiring expert knowledge about the structure-activity relationship of chemical compounds, the systematic feature selection step in our method offers a convenient means to identify relevant 2D fingerprint-based features. By comparing our method with state-of-the-art linear regression-based methods for the standard Gibbs free energy prediction, we demonstrated that its prediction accuracy and prediction coverage are most favorable. Our results show direct evidence that a number of 2D fingerprints collectively provide useful information about the Gibbs free energy of biochemical reactions and that our systematic feature selection procedure provides a convenient way to identify them.

10.1007/s10620-019-05791-4  |  Diagnosis, Robotics  |  Diagnosis, Robotics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Review  |   Video capsule endoscopy became a reality in 2001. This device enabled us to directly view the mucosa of the small intestine for the first time. The main indications for the video capsule remain the detection of small intestinal bleeding and iron deficiency anemia, diagnosis and management of Crohn's disease, and detection of tumors. The device is extraordinarily safe and can be used in the very young to the very old. However, there remain several areas of controversy and difficulty. These are covered in this article and include details of indications and contraindications, whether to prepare patients, whether or not to use simethicone and prokinetics. Detection of location of the capsule remains a major engineering challenge. Reading the videos reliably and quickly remains challenging. However, artificial intelligence and machine learning are already on the horizon to provide assistance. New uses for capsule endoscopy promise more accurate diagnosis and hence improved management of acute gastrointestinal bleeding. The colon capsule may eventually help those who refuse conventional colonoscopy, and robotically controlled capsules may be helpful in screening for serious disease in patients with upper abdominal complaints. The advent of the broadening use of video capsule endoscopy is, though it will be controversial, embraced by some and derided by others; such is the nature of technological development. In the long run, if the use of the video capsule, based on sound evidence-based studies, can be shown to improve the care of our patients and reduce the cost of health care, its use will continue to expand.

One of the most rapidly evolving modalities is artificial intelligence with recent studies providing real-time diagnoses and encouraging results in the first randomised trials to conventional endoscopic imaging. Advances in functional hypoxia imaging offer novel opportunities to be used to detect neoplasia and the assessment of colitis. Three-dimensional volumetric imaging provides spatial information and has shown promise in the increased detection of small polyps. Studies to date of self-propelling colonoscopes demonstrate an increased caecal intubation rate and possibly offer patients a more comfortable procedure. Further development in robotic technology has introduced ex vivo automated locomotor upper gastrointestinal and small bowel capsule devices. Eye-tracking has the potential to revolutionise endoscopic training through the identification of differences in experts and non-expert endoscopist as trainable parameters. In this review, we discuss the latest innovations of all these technologies and provide perspective into the exciting future of diagnostic luminal endoscopy.

In this review, we explore the evolution and background of Computer Assisted Orthopaedic Surgery (CAOS), delving into the basic principles behind the technology and the changes in the discussion on the subject throughout the years and the impact these discussions had on the field. We found evidence that industry had an important role in driving the discussion at least in knee arthroplasty-a leading field of CAOS-with the ratio between patents and publications increased from approximately 1:10 in 2004 to almost 1:3 in 2014. The adoption of CAOS is largely restrained by economics and ergonomics with sceptics challenging the accuracy and precision of navigation during the early years of CAOS moving to patient functional improvements and long term survivorship. Nevertheless, the future of CAOS remains positive with the prospect of new technologies such as improvements in image-guided surgery, enhanced navigation systems, robotics and artificial intelligence.

Although crowding is a ubiquitous phenomenon, since elements are rarely seen in isolation, to date there exists no consensus on how to model it. Previous experiments showed that the global configuration of the entire stimulus must be taken into account. These findings rule out simple pooling or substitution models and favor models sensitive to global spatial aspects. In order to investigate how to incorporate global aspects into models, we tested a large number of models with a database of forty stimuli tailored for the global aspects of crowding. Our results show that incorporating grouping like components strongly improves model performance.

10.3390/s19010125  |  Smart Healthcare  |  Smart Healthcare  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   In the era of the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence, the Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based indoor positioning system (IPS) has been recognized as the most promising IPS for various applications. Fingerprinting-based algorithms critically rely on a fingerprint database built from machine learning methods. However, currently methods are based on single-feature Received Signal Strength (RSS), which is extremely unstable in performance in terms of precision and robustness. The reason for this is that single feature machines cannot capture the complete channel characteristics and are susceptible to interference. The objective of this paper is to exploit the Time of Arrival (TOA) feature and propose a heterogeneous features fusion model to enhance the precision and robustness of indoor positioning. Several challenges are addressed: (1) machine learning models based on heterogeneous features, (2) the optimization of algorithms for high precision and robustness, and (3) computational complexity. This paper provides several heterogeneous features fusion-based localization models. Their effectiveness and efficiency are thoroughly compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Even based on a small 2D materials data set, we can fundamentally approach an accurate and rational model about the band gap and exciton binding energy with robust transferability to other databases. Our machine learning outputs can reveal the exact physics pictures behind the predicted quantity as well as the "secondary understanding" of the correlation between the approximated physics models in exciton. This work stresses the significant value of physics endorsement on the machine learning (ML) algorithm and provides a symbolic regression solution for the "few-shot" training scheme for ML technology in materials science. Moreover, physics-inspired secondary understanding could be an essential supplement for ML in scientific research fields.

The current research was designed to evaluate the fungicidal action of <i>S persica</i> aquatic root extract in terms of radial growth rate and inhibition zone (IZO) versus 3 pathogenic <i>Aspergillus</i> species, namely, <i>A nige</i>r, <i>A flavus</i>, and <i>A fumigatus</i> in vitro. The results revealed that the plant extract (50 and 100 mg/mL) exhibited a prohibiting influence on the growth of the tested fungal species. The high concentration (100 mg/mL) of the plant extract <i>was</i> efficient in prohibiting the growing rate of the tested <i>Aspergillus</i> species after 6 days exposure period. <i>Aspergillus niger</i> and <i>A flavus</i> showed the largest inhibition ratios (60% and 54.4%, respectively) and IZO (33.00 ± 0.05 mm and 25.50 ± 0.18 mm, respectively) versus the control counterparts. <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> showed the minimum inhibition ratio (39%) and IZO (20.31 ± 0.05). The present data showed that the extract of <i>S persica</i> possesses potential fungicidal influence versus the tested pathogenic <i>Aspergillus</i> species and this may support the utilization of this extract as a promising antifungal agent versus aspergillosis.

10.12701/yujm.2019.00206  |  Other  |  None, Other  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Review  |   Medical education research subjects are incredibly diverse and have changed over time. This work in particular aims to compare and analyze research trends in medical education through the words used in the titles of these research papers. Academic Medicine (the journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges), Medical Teacher (the journal of the Association of Medical Education in Europe), the Korean Journal of Medical Education (KJME), and Korean Medical Education Review (KMER) were selected and analyzed for the purposes of this research. From 2009 to 2018, Academic Medicine and Medical Teacher published approximately 10 to 20 times more papers than the KJME and KMER. Frequently used words in these titles include "medical," "student," "education," and "learning." The words "clinical" and "learning" were used relatively often (7.80% to 13.66%) in Korean journals and Medical Teacher, but Academic Medicine used these phrases relatively less often (6.47% and 4.41%, respectively). Concern with such various topics as problem-based learning, team-based learning, program evaluations, burnout, e-learning, and digital indicates that Medical Teacher seems to primarily deal with teaching and learning methodologies, and Academic Medicine handles all aspects of medical education. The KJME and KMER did not cover all subjects, as they publish smaller papers. However, it is anticipated that research on new subjects, such as artificial intelligence in medical education, will occur in the near future.

We demonstrate that our three-step method for measuring distances in the Hilbert space is far less complex than reconstructing density matrices and that it can be applied in quantum-enhanced machine learning to reduce the complexity of calculating Euclidean distances between multidimensional points, which can be especially interesting for near term quantum technologies and quantum artificial intelligence research. Our results are also a novel example of applying mixed states in quantum information processing. Usually working with mixed states is undesired, but here it gives the possibility of encoding extra information as the degree of coherence between the given two dimensions of the density matrix.

Because Chinese language is quite different with English language, the machine cannot simply get the graphical and phonetic information form Chinese characters. The method for Chinese should be different from that for English. Chinese characters present abundant information with the graphical features, recent research on Chinese word embedding tries to use graphical information as subword. This paper uses both graphical and phonetic features to improve Chinese Clinical Named Entity Recognition based on the presence of phono-semantic characters. 
  Methods:  This paper proposed three different embedding models and tested them on the annotated data. The data have been divided into two sections for exploring the effect of the proportion of phono-semantic characters. 
  Results:  The model using primary radical and pinyin can improve Clinical Named Entity Recognition in Chinese and get the F-measure of 0.712. More phono-semantic characters does not give a better result. 
  Conclusions:  The paper proves that the use of the combination of graphical and phonetic features can improve the Clinical Named Entity Recognition in Chinese.

The purpose of drug drug interaction (DDI) extraction is to automatically obtain the interaction between drugs from biomedical literature. Current state-of-the-art approaches for DDI extraction task are based on artificial intelligence and natural language processing. While such existing DDI extraction methods can provide more knowledge and enhance the performance through external resources such as biomedical databases or ontologies, due to the difficulty of updating, these external resources are delayed. In fact, user generated content (UGC) is another kind of external medical resources that can be quickly updated. We are trying to use UGC resources to provide more available information for our deep learning DDI extraction method. In this paper, we present a DDI extraction approach through a new attention mechanism called full-attention which can combine the UGC information with contextual information. We conducted a series of experiments on the DDI 2013 Evaluation dataset to evaluate our method. Experiments show improved performance compared with the state of the art and UGC-DDI model achieves a competitive F-score of 0.712.

However, the microbiome data is complex, with high noise and dimensions. Traditional machine learning methods are limited by the models' representation ability and cannot learn complex patterns from the data. Recently, deep learning has been widely applied to fields ranging from text processing to image recognition due to its efficient flexibility and high capacity. But the deep learning models must be trained with enough data in order to achieve good performance, which is impractical in reality. In addition, deep learning is considered as black box and hard to interpret. These factors make deep learning not widely used in microbiome-wide association studies. In this work, we construct a sparse microbial interaction network and embed this graph into deep model to alleviate the risk of overfitting and improve the performance. Further, we explore a Graph Embedding Deep Feedforward Network (GEDFN) to conduct feature selection and guide meaningful microbial markers' identification. Based on the experimental results, we verify the feasibility of combining the microbial graph model with the deep learning model, and demonstrate the feasibility of applying deep learning and feature selection on microbial data. Our main contributions are: firstly, we utilize different methods to construct a variety of microbial interaction networks and combine the network <i>via</i> graph embedding deep learning. Secondly, we introduce a feature selection method based on graph embedding and validate the biological meaning of microbial markers. The code is available at https://github.com/MicroAVA/GEDFN.git.

Previous studies usually equated filter bubbles with community structures and emphasized this exogenous isolation effect, but there is a lack of full discussion of the internal organization of filter bubbles. Here, we design an experiment for analysing filter bubbles taking advantage of social bots. We deployed 128 bots to Weibo (the largest microblogging network in China), and each bot consumed a specific topic (entertainment or sci-tech) and ran for at least two months. In total, we recorded about 1.3 million messages exposed to these bots and their social networks. By analysing the text received by the bots and motifs in their social networks, we found that a filter bubble is not only a dense community of users with the same preferences but also presents an endogenetic unidirectional star-like structure. The structure could spontaneously exclude non-preferred information and cause polarization. Moreover, our work proved that the felicitous use of artificial intelligence technology could provide a useful experimental approach that combines privacy protection and controllability in studying social media.

About 80% of the aging population will be in the developing countries. Aging population may suffer from various physical, cognitive, and social problems, due to aging process such as impairment of physical related functions (decreased mobility and walking speed, falls, frailty, decreased walking speed, difficulties in basic, and instrumental activities of daily living), cognitive related functions (memory-related issues), sensory functions (hearing loss, cataracts and refractive errors, presbyopia, decreased vestibular function), behavioural and psychological disorders, social isolation issues, and poor quality of life. Over the period of the last few decades, emerging technologies such as internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), sensors, cloud computing, wireless communication technologies, and assistive robotics have given the vision to develop various ambient or active assisted living (AAL) approaches for supporting an elderly people to live safely and independently in their living environment and participate in their daily and community activities, as well as supporting them to maintain their physical, mental health, and quality of their life. The aim of this paper is to review the use of Ambient or Active Assisted Living for older adults with physical, cognitive impairments, and their social participation.

Therefore, it is important and necessary to evaluate the functional relationship of miRNAs and then predict novel miRNA-disease associations. For this purpose, here we developed the updated web server MISIM (miRNA similarity) v2.0. Besides a 3-fold increase in data content compared with MISIM v1.0, MISIM v2.0 improved the original MISIM algorithm by implementing both positive and negative miRNA-disease associations. That is, the MISIM v2.0 scores could be positive or negative, whereas MISIM v1.0 only produced positive scores. Moreover, MISIM v2.0 achieved an algorithm for novel miRNA-disease prediction based on MISIM v2.0 scores. Finally, MISIM v2.0 provided network visualization and functional enrichment analysis for functionally paired miRNAs. The MISIM v2.0 web server is freely accessible at http://www.lirmed.com/misim/.

However, a series of international studies have reported needs for improvements of the existing pSS scoring procedures in terms of inter/intra observer reliability before being established as standardized diagnostic tools. The present study aims to solve this problem by employing radiomics features and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to make the pSS scoring more objective and faster compared to human expert scoring. The assessment of AI algorithms was performed on a two-centric cohort, which included 600 SGUS images (150 patients) annotated using the original SGUS scoring system proposed in 1992 for pSS. For each image, we extracted 907 histogram-based and descriptive statistics features from segmented salivary glands. Optimal feature subsets were found using the genetic algorithm based wrapper approach. Among the considered algorithms (seven classifiers and five regressors), the best preforming was the multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier (κ = 0.7). The MLP over-performed average score achieved by the clinicians (κ = 0.67) by the considerable margin, whereas its reliability was on the level of human intra-observer variability (κ = 0.71). The presented findings indicate that the continuously increasing HarmonicSS cohort will enable further advancements in AI-based pSS scoring methods by SGUS. In turn, this may establish SGUS as an effective noninvasive pSS diagnostic tool, with the final goal to supplement current diagnostic tests.

However, the underlying neural mechanisms of the effect of <i>Budo</i> on attention processing has not yet been investigated. <i>Kendo</i>, a type of fencing using bamboo swords, is one of the most popular forms of <i>Budo</i> worldwide. We investigated the difference in functional connectivity (FC) between <i>Kendo</i> players (KPs) and non-KPs (NKPs) during an attention-related auditory oddball paradigm and during rest. The analyses focused on the brain network related to "motivation." Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and task-based fMRI using the oddball paradigm were performed in healthy male volunteers (14 KPs and 11 NKPs). Group differences in FC were tested using CONN-software within the motivation network, which consisted of 22 brain regions defined by a previous response-conflict task-based fMRI study with a reward cue. Daily general physical activities were assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). We also investigated the impact of major confounders, namely, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, IPAQ score, body mass index (BMI), and reaction time (RT) in the oddball paradigm. Resting-state fMRI revealed that KPs had a significantly lower FC than NKPs between the right nucleus accumbens and right frontal eye field (FEF) within the motivation network. Conversely, KPs exhibited a significantly higher FC than NKPs between the left intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and the left precentral gyrus (PCG) within the network during the auditory oddball paradigm [statistical thresholds, False Discovery Rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05]. These results remained significant after controlling for major covariates. Our results suggest that attenuated motivation network integrity at rest together with enhanced motivation network integrity during attentional demands might underlie the instantaneous concentration abilities of KPs.

First, we briefly explore the historical evidence using film-screen mammography, before providing an in-depth description of evidence using digital mammography. We classify studies according to which exact version of double reading they use, because the evidence suggests that effectiveness of double reading is contingent on whether the two radiologists are blinded to one another's decisions, and how the decisions of the two radiologists are integrated. Finally, we explore the implications for future mammography, including using artificial intelligence as the second reader, and applications to more complex three-dimensional imaging techniques such as tomosynthesis.

The IoT platform with a surveillance robot provides the smart monitoring as a role of active CCTV. The intelligent surveillance robot, which has been built with its own IoT server, and can carry out line tracing and acquire contextual information through the sensors to detect abnormal status in an environment. In addition, photos taken by its camera can be compared with stored images of normal state. If an abnormal status is detected, the manager receives an alarm via a smart phone. For user convenience, the client is provided with an app to control the robot remotely. In the case of image context processing it is useful to apply convolutional neural network (CNN)-based machine learning (ML), which is introduced for the precise detection and recognition of images or patterns, and from which can be expected a high performance of recognition. We designed the CNN model to support contextually-aware services of the IoT platform and to perform experiments for learning accuracy of the designed CNN model using dataset of images acquired from the robot. Experimental results showed that the accuracy of learning is over 0.98, which means that we achieved enhanced learning in image context recognition. The contribution of this paper is not only to implement an IoT platform with active CCTV robot but also to construct a CNN model for image-and-context-aware learning and intelligence enhancement of the proposed IoT platform. The proposed IoT platform, with an intelligent surveillance robot using machine learning, can be used to detect abnormal status in various industrial fields such as factory, smart farms, logistics warehouses, and public places.

10.1007/s00221-018-5441-x  |  Robotics  |  Robotics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Review  |   The development of advanced and effective human-machine interfaces, especially for amputees to control their prostheses, is very high priority and a very active area of research. An intuitive control method should retain an adequate level of functionality for dexterous operation, provide robustness against confounding factors, and supply adaptability for diverse long-term usage, all of which are current problems being tackled by researchers. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art, as well as, the limitations of current myoelectric signal control (MSC) methods. To address the research topic on functionality, we review different approaches to prosthetic hand control (DOF configuration, discrete or simultaneous, etc.), and how well the control is performed (accuracy, response, intuitiveness, etc.). To address the research on robustness, we review the confounding factors (limb positions, electrode shift, force variance, and inadvertent activity) that affect the stability of the control performance. Lastly, to address adaptability, we review the strategies that can automatically adjust the classifier for different individuals and for long-term usage. This review provides a thorough overview of the current MSC methods and helps highlight the current areas of research focus and resulting clinic usability for the MSC methods for upper-limb prostheses.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116333  |  Other  |  Prognosis  |  Linear Discriminate Analysis  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Decision-making plays an essential role in the interpersonal interactions and cognitive processing of individuals. There has been increasing interest in being able to predict an individual's decision-making response (i.e., acceptance or rejection). We proposed an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based computational intelligence framework to predict individual responses. Specifically, the discriminative spatial network pattern (DSNP), a supervised learning approach, was applied to single-trial EEG data to extract the DSNP feature from the single-trial brain network. A linear discriminate analysis (LDA) trained on the DSNP features was then used to predict the individual response trial-by-trial. To verify the performance of the proposed DSNP, we recruited two independent subject groups, and recorded the EEGs using two types of EEG systems. The performances of the trial-by-trial predictors achieved an accuracy of 0.88 ± 0.09 for the first dataset, and 0.90 ± 0.10 for the second dataset. These trial-by-trial prediction performances suggested that individual responses could be predicted trial-by-trial by using the specific pattern of single-trial EEG networks, and our proposed method has the potential to establish the biologically inspired artificial intelligence decision system.

10.2196/13111  |  Smart Healthcare, Treatment  |  Treatment, Smart Healthcare  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Physical rehabilitation is recommended after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). With the expected increase in TKA over the next few decades, it is important to find new ways of delivering cost-effective interventions. Technological interventions have been developed with this intent, but only preliminary evidence exists regarding their validity, with short follow-up times. 
  Objective:  This study aimed to present the follow-up results of a feasibility study comparing two different home-based programs after TKA: conventional face-to-face sessions and a digital intervention performed through the use of an artificial intelligence-powered biofeedback system under remote clinical monitoring. 
  Methods:  The digital intervention uses a motion tracker allowing 3D movement quantification, a mobile app and a Web portal. This study presents the results of the previous single-center, prospective, parallel-group, feasibility study including an 8-week active treatment stage and further assessments at 3 and 6 months post-TKA. Primary outcome was the Timed Up and Go score, and secondary outcomes were the Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Scale (KOOS) score and knee range of motion. 
  Results:  A total of 59 patients completed the study (30 in the digital intervention group and 29 in the conventional rehabilitation group) and follow-up assessments. During the active treatment stage, patients in the digital intervention group demonstrated high engagement and satisfaction levels, with an 82% retention rate. Both groups attained clinically relevant improvements from baseline to 6 months post-TKA. At the end of the 8-week program, clinical outcomes were superior in the digital intervention group. At the 3- and 6-month assessments, the outcomes remained superior for the Timed Up and Go score (P&lt;.001) and all KOOS subscale scores (at 3 months, P&lt;.001 overall; at 6 months, KOOS Symptoms: P=.006, Pain: P=.002, Activities of Daily Living: P=.001, Sports: P=.003, and Quality of Life: P=.001). There was progressive convergence between both groups in terms of the knee range of motion, which remained higher for standing flexion in the digital intervention group than the conventional group at 6 months (P=.01). For the primary outcome, at 6 months, the median difference between groups was 4.87 seconds (95% CI 1.85-7.47), in favor of the digital intervention group. 
  Conclusions:  The present study demonstrates that this novel digital intervention for independent home-based rehabilitation after TKA is feasible, engaging, and capable of maximizing clinical outcomes in comparison to conventional rehabilitation in the short and medium term; in addition, this intervention is far less demanding in terms of human resources.

10.1371/journal.pone.0208308  |  None  |  Prognosis, Treatment  |  ANN, Kidney-inspired Algorithm  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Optimization of an artificial neural network model through the use of optimization algorithms is the common method employed to search for an optimum solution for a broad variety of real-world problems. One such optimization algorithm is the kidney-inspired algorithm (KA) which has recently been proposed in the literature. The algorithm mimics the four processes performed by the kidneys: filtration, reabsorption, secretion, and excretion. However, a human with reduced kidney function needs to undergo additional treatment to improve kidney performance. In the medical field, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) test is used to check the health of kidneys. The test estimates the amount of blood that passes through the glomeruli each minute. In this paper, we mimic this kidney function test and the GFR result is used to select a suitable step to add to the basic KA process. This novel imitation is designed for both minimization and maximization problems. In the proposed method, depends on GFR test result which is less than 15 or falls between 15 and 60 or is more than 60 a particular action is performed. These additional processes are applied as required with the aim of improving exploration of the search space and increasing the likelihood of the KA finding the optimum solution. The proposed method is tested on test functions and its results are compared with those of the basic KA. Its performance on benchmark classification and time series prediction problems is also examined and compared with that of other available methods in the literature. In addition, the proposed method is applied to a real-world water quality prediction problem. The statistical analysis of all these applications showed that the proposed method had a ability to improve the optimization outcome.

It is comprised of a set of programmable information processing mechanisms that can be used to predict and explain human behavior including cognition and interaction with the environment. We start by reviewing its history, which shapes its current form, contrasts and relates it to other architectures, and helps readers to anticipate where it is going. Based on this history, we then describe it as a theory of cognition that is realized as a computer program. After this, we briefly discuss tools for working with ACT-R, and also note several major accomplishments that have been gained by working with ACT-R in both basic and applied science, including summarizing some of the insights about human behavior. We conclude by discussing its future, which we believe will include adding emotions and physiology, increasing usability, and the use of nongenerative models. This article is categorized under: Computer Science &gt; Artificial Intelligence Psychology &gt; Reasoning and Decision Making Psychology &gt; Theory and Methods.

PMID:30778510  |  Other  |  None, Other  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Review  |   Words denoting abstract concepts constitute nearly half of human lexicon and serve as building blocks of the human culture. Since the advent of non-invasive neuroimaging techniques, great progress has been made in revealing the neurobiological foundation of concrete object and action concepts, yet it remains unclear how abstract concepts are stored and processed in the brain. Here we review recent development in this field, focusing on both theoretical perspectives and neuroimaging findings. We found that abstract concepts can be represented via linguistic and experiential information; the neural correlates of abstract concepts are partly in line with such a theoretical framework. Future studies are warranted to uncover the cognitive and neural mechanisms of language and experience in abstract word representation, which will help to deepen our understanding of general computational principles of the human conceptual system and to promote the development of the brain-like artificial intelligence.

However, it is difficult to identify them using common health tests. This worksite-based cohort study for 7 years in Japan (n = 7465) was conducted to evaluate the progression of CKD. The outcome was aggravation of the KDIGO prognostic category of CKD 7 years later. The subjects were male, 59.1%; age, 50.1 ± 6.3 years; and eGFR, 79 ± 14.4 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. The number of subjects showing CKD progression started to increase from 3 years later. Vector analysis showed that CKD stage G1 A1 was more progressive than CKD stage G2 A1. Bayesian networks showed that the time-series changes in the prognostic category of CKD were related to the outcome. Support vector machines including time-series data of the prognostic category of CKD from 3 years later detected the high possibility of the outcome not only in subjects at very high risks but also in those at low risks at baseline. In conclusion, after the evaluation of kidney function at a health checkup, it is necessary to follow up not only patients at high risks but also patients at low risks at baseline for 3 years and longer.

Here, the RNA sequencing data related to vascular invasion in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, including 292 HCC patients with complete clinical data were included in our study as the training dataset for construction and E-TABM-36, including 41 HCC patients with complete clinical data was used as the validation dataset. Following data normalization, differentially expressed mRNA and copy number (CN) were selected between with and without vascular invasion samples. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was constructed and validated in GSE9828 and GSE20017 datasets. Total 59 feature genes were found by the SVM classifier. Using Cox regression analysis, three clinical features, including Patholigic T, Stage and vascular invasion and 6 optimal prognostic genes, including ANO1, EPHX2, GFRA1, OLFM2, SERPINA10 and TKT were significantly correlated with prognosis. A risk score formula was developed to assess the prognostic value of 6 optimal prognostic genes, which were identified to possess the most remarkable correlation with overall survival in HCC patients. By performing in vitro experiments, we observed TKT was significantly increased, but OLFM2 was decreased in high metastatic potential HCC cell lines (SK-HEP-1 and MHCC-97 H) compared with low metastatic potential cell line Huh7 and normal human liver cell line LO2 using western blotting analysis. Knockdown of TKT in MHCC-97H or overexpression of OLFM2 in SK-HEP-1 significantly suppressed cell migration and invasion using transwell assays. Our results demonstrated that TKT and OLFM2 might be novel independent biomarkers for predicting survival based on the presence of vascular invasion in patients with HCC.

10.3390/ijms20184462  |  Genetics  |  Diagnosis, Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Apple skin russeting naturally occurs in many varieties, particularly in "Golden Delicious" and its pedigree, and is regarded as a non-invasive physiological disorder partly caused by excessive deposition of lignin. However, the understanding of its molecular mechanism is still limited. In this study, we used iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation) and RNA-seq to detect the changes in the expression levels of genes and proteins in three developmental stages of russeting formation, in russeted (non-bagging) and non-russeted (bagging) skin of "Golden Delicious" apple. 2856 differentially expressed genes and 942 differentially expressed proteins in the comparison groups were detected at the transcript level and protein level, respectively. A correlation analysis of the transcriptomics and proteomics data revealed that four genes (MD03G1059200, MD08G1009200, MD17G1092400, and MD17G1225100) involved in lignin biosynthesis are significant changed during apple russeting formation. Additionally, 92 transcription factors, including 4 LIM transcription factors, may be involved in apple russeting formation. Among them, one LIM transcription factor (MD15G1068200) was capable of binding to the PAL-box like (CCACTTGAGTAC) element, which indicated it was potentially involved in lignin biosynthesis. This study will provide further views on the molecular mechanisms controlling apple russeting formation.

10.1371/journal.pone.0218946  |  Other  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) formation is part of the neutrophil response to infections, but excessive or inappropriate NETosis may trigger the production of autoantibodies and cause organ damage in autoimmune disorders. Spontaneously netting neutrophils are not frequent and induction of NET in vitro by selected stimuli is necessary to investigate their structure. In the present work, the protein composition and post-translational modifications of NET produced under different stimuli have been studied by means of proteomic analysis. Neutrophils from healthy donors were stimulated by PMA, A23187, Escherichia coli LPS or untreated; after three hours, cells were washed, treated with DNase and supernatants collected for mass spectrometry. Data were analyzed by unsupervised hierarchical clustering analyses. We identified proteins contained in NETs of any source or exclusive of one stimulus: LPS-induced and spontaneous NET diverge in protein composition, while PMA- and A23187-induced NET appear more similar. Among the post-translational modifications we examined, methionine sulfoxidation is frequent especially in PMA- and LPS-induced NETs. Myeloperoxidase is the protein more extensively modified. Thus, proteomic analysis indicates that NETs induced by different stimuli are heterogeneous in terms of both protein composition and post-translational modifications, suggesting that NET induced in different conditions may have different biological effects.

However, the developmental characteristics and cellular lineage of adipocyte in the T-PVAT remain unclear. We show that T-PVAT contains three long strip-shaped fat depots, anterior T-PVAT (A-T-PVAT), left lateral T-PVAT (LL-T-PVAT), and right lateral T-PVAT (RL-T-PVAT). A-T-PVAT displays a distinct transcriptional profile and developmental origin compared to the two lateral T-PVATs (L-T-PVAT). Lineage tracing studies indicate that A-T-PVAT adipocytes are primarily derived from SM22α<sup>+</sup> progenitors, whereas L-T-PVAT contains both SM22α<sup>+</sup> and Myf5<sup>+</sup> cells. We also show that L-T-PVAT contains more UCP1<sup>+</sup> brown adipocytes than A-T-PVAT, and L-T-PVAT exerts a greater relaxing effect on aorta than A-T-PVAT. Angiotensin II-infused hypertensive mice display greater macrophage infiltration into A-T-PVAT than L-T-PVAT. These combined results indicate that L-T-PVAT has a distinct development from A-T-PVAT with different cellular lineage, and suggest that L-T-PVAT and A-T-PVAT have different physiological and pathological functions.

Stable circular RNAs (circRNAs) can be found at high levels in exosomes, and there is evidence to suggest that they may be viable diagnostic biomarkers for certain cancers. However, circRNAs in the serum of OC patients have rarely been evaluated to date. We therefore sought to investigate serum circRNA profiles of OC patients, and to explore whether these sorts of circRNAs could be used to detect early OC, serving as biomarkers of disease that may allow for the earlier treatment thereof. Second-generation sequencing was used to screen differentially expressed circRNAs in OC patient serum and also in the serum obtained from healthy controls, and circRNA expression was confirmed by qPCR. A bioinformatics-based approach was then used to assess what biological functions might be affected be the altered regulation of these RNA molecules. We further conducted GO, KEGG, and network analyses to further explore the expression of circRNAs. We detected 178 differentially expressed circRNAs in OC patient serum, of which 175 were up-regulated and 3 were down-regulated. We validated 5 of these identified circRNAs by qPCR to confirm their expression, and further found these RNAs to be closely linked with FC gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, VEGF signaling, Transcriptional misregulation in cancer, Chemokine signaling, ErbB signaling, and TNF signaling based on conducted analyses. This study provides a profile of circRNAs in OC patient serum, revealing a pattern of dysregulation of these RNAs associated with OC. Our bioinformatics analysis suggested that these circRNAs are likely related to OC development, and as such they may be viable novel OC biomarkers.

These enzymes have a significant role to play during plant growth and development, which can response to various stresses. To date, the E2 family has been reported in some high plants, but the genome-wide characterization of this gene family in potato remains unknown. In the present study, 57 putative StUBCs were identified, which were clustered into eight subgroups based on phylogeny. The introns varied in numbers 0 to 9. The highest numbers of introns were 5, which accounted for 31.57%. The analysis of gene duplication showed that 22 StUBC genes were involved in 13 segmental duplication events, while no tandem duplication was found in StUBC genes. According to gene ontology analysis (GO), StUBC family major function is protein binding and ion binding. The RNA sequencing data revealed that 15 StUBC genes were highly expressed in different organs and tubers. 27 StUBC genes were up-regulated under 50 µM ABA treatments. Moreover, the RNA-seq data and qRT-PCR analysis indicated that 17 StUBC genes responded to heat stress. 8 StUBC genes responded to salt stress according to qRT-PCR analysis, and StUBC2, StUBC12, StUBC30 and StUBC13 were predominant expression. The result of this research could provide valuable information to insight into potato E2 family and establish a foundation for further to elucidate function of E2 genes.

In nature, swarms possess remarkable properties, which allow many organisms, from swarming bacteria to ants and flocking birds, to form higher-order structures that enhance their behavior as a group. Swarm simulations highlight three important factors to create novelty and diversity: (a) communication generates combinatorial cooperative dynamics, (b) concurrency allows for separation of time scales, and (c) complexity and size increases push the system towards transitions in innovation. We illustrate these three components in a model computing the continuous evolution of a swarm of agents. The results, divided into three distinct applications, show how emergent structures are capable of filtering information through the bottleneck of their memory, to produce meaningful novelty and diversity within their simulated environment.

Ubiquitination plays a critical role in protein degradation, a hallmark of organ senescence. Therefore, we investigated changes in the proteome and ubiquitome of senescing rose (<i>Rosa hybrida</i>) petals to better understand their involvement in petal senescence. Of 3859 proteins quantified in senescing petals, 1198 were upregulated, and 726 were downregulated during senescence. We identified 2208 ubiquitinated sites, including 384 with increased ubiquitination in 298 proteins and 1035 with decreased ubiquitination in 674 proteins. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses revealed that proteins related to peptidases in proteolysis and autophagy pathways were enriched in the proteome, suggesting that protein degradation and autophagy play important roles in petal senescence. In addition, many transporter proteins accumulated in senescing petals, and several transport processes were enriched in the ubiquitome, indicating that transport of substances is associated with petal senescence and regulated by ubiquitination. Moreover, several components of the brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis and signaling pathways were significantly altered at the protein and ubiquitination levels, implying that BR plays an important role in petal senescence. Our data provide a comprehensive view of rose petal senescence at the posttranslational level.

This study employed a novel approach combining multi-platform transcriptomics and cutting-edge algorithms to introduce novel signatures for accurate diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Different random forests (RF)-based feature selection methods including the area under the curve (AUC)-RF, Boruta, and Vita were used and the diagnostic performance of the proposed biosignatures was benchmarked using RF, logistic regression, naïve Bayes, and k-nearest neighbors models. All models showed satisfactory performance in which RF appeared to be the best. For instance, regarding the RF model, the following were observed: mean accuracy 0.998 (standard deviation (SD) &lt; 0.003), mean specificity 0.999 (SD &lt; 0.003), and mean sensitivity 0.998 (SD &lt; 0.004). Moreover, proposed biomarker signatures were highly associated with multifaceted hallmarks in cancer. Some biomarkers were found to be enriched in epithelial cell signaling in <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection and inflammatory processes. The overexpression of <i>TGFBI</i> and <i>S100A2</i> was associated with poor disease-free survival while the down-regulation of <i>NR5A2</i>, <i>SLC4A4</i>, and <i>CD177</i> was linked to worse overall survival of the patients. In conclusion, novel transcriptome signatures to improve the diagnostic accuracy in CRC are introduced for further validations in various clinical settings.

In this study, we performed a genome-wide identification and expression analysis of genes encoding ABC transporter proteins in three Capsicum species, i.e., Capsicum annuum, Capsicum baccatum and Capsicum chinense. Capsicum is a valuable horticultural crop worldwide as an important constituent of many foods while containing several medicinal compounds including capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin. Our results identified the presence of a total of 200, 185 and 187 ABC transporter genes in C. annuum, C. baccatum and C. chinense genomes, respectively. Capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin content were determined in green pepper fruits (16 dpa). Additionally, we conducted different bioinformatics analyses including ABC genes classification, gene chromosomal location, Cis elements, conserved motifs identification and gene ontology classification, as well as profile expression of selected genes. Based on phylogenetic analysis and domain organization, the Capsicum ABC gene family was grouped into eight subfamilies. Among them, members within the ABCG, ABCB and ABCC subfamilies were the most abundant, while ABCD and ABCE subfamilies were less abundant throughout all species. ABC members within the same subfamily showed similar motif composition. Furthermore, common cis-elements involved in the transcriptional regulation were also identified in the promoter regions of all Capsicum ABC genes. Gene expression data from RNAseq and reverse transcription-semi-quantitative PCR analysis revealed development-specific stage expression profiles in placenta tissues. It suggests that ABC transporters, specifically the ABCC and ABCG subfamilies, may be playing important roles in the transport of secondary metabolites such as capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin to the placenta vacuoles, effecting on their content in pepper fruits. Our results provide a more comprehensive understanding of ABC transporter gene family in different Capsicum species while allowing the identification of important candidate genes related to capsaicin content for subsequent functional validation.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the RA-TKA's ability to assist with intraoperative correction of: (1) flexion and (2) extension gaps, as well as its ability to (3) accurately predict implant sizes. Additionally, in this RA-TKA cohort, length of stay, complications, and readmissions were assessed. A total of 335 patients who underwent RA-TKA were included. The robotic software virtually measured the intraoperative prebone cut extension and flexion gaps. Differences in medial versus lateral prebone cut extension and flexion gaps were calculated. A total of 155 patients (46%) had an extension gap difference of between -2 and 2 mm (mean, -0.3 mm), while 119 patients (36%) had a flexion gap difference of between -2 and 2 mm (mean, -0.6 mm). Postbone cut differences in medial versus lateral flexion and extension gaps were measured. Balanced knees were considered to have a medial and lateral flexion gap difference within 2 mm. The robot-predicted implant size was also compared with the final implant size. Additionally, lengths of stay, complications, and readmissions were assessed. All patients achieved a postbone cut extension gap difference between -1 and 1 mm (mean, -0.1 mm). A total of 332 patients (99%) achieved a postbone cut flexion gap difference of between -2 and 2 mm (mean, 0 mm). For 98% of prostheses, the robotic software predicted within 1 implant size the actual tibial or femoral implant size used.The mean length of stay was found to be 2 days. No patients suffered from superficial skin infection, pin site infections or fractures, soft tissue damage, and no robotic cases were converted to manual TKA due to intraoperative complications. A total of 8 patients (2.2%) were readmitted; however, none were directly related to robotic use. The robotic software and use of a preoperative computed tomography (CT) substantially helped with intraoperative planning and accurate prediction of implant sizes. Therefore, based on the results of this study, the RA-TKA device does, in fact, provide considerable intraoperative assistance.

This study aimed to create a highly accurate machine learning model to perform glioma grading. 
  Methods and materials:  Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging acquired for cases of glioma operated on at our institution from October 2014 through January 2018 were obtained retrospectively. Six types of magnetic resonance imaging sequences (T<sub>2</sub>-weighted image, diffusion-weighted image, apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC], fractional anisotropy, and mean kurtosis [MK]) were chosen for analysis; 476 features were extracted semiautomatically for each sequence (2856 features in total). Recursive feature elimination was used to select significant features for a machine learning model that distinguishes glioblastoma from lower-grade glioma (grades 2 and 3). 
  Results:  Fifty-five data sets from 54 cases were obtained (14 grade 2 gliomas, 12 grade 3 gliomas, and 29 glioblastomas), of which 44 and 11 data sets were used for machine learning and independent testing, respectively. We detected 504 features with significant differences (false discovery rate &lt;0.05) between glioblastoma and lower-grade glioma. The most accurate machine learning model was created using 6 features extracted from the ADC and MK images. In the logistic regression, the area under the curve was 0.90 ± 0.05, and the accuracy of the test data set was 0.91 (10 out of 11); using a support vector machine, they were 0.93 ± 0.03 and 0.91 (10 out of 11), respectively (kernel, radial basis function; c = 1.0). 
  Conclusions:  Our machine learning model accurately predicted glioma tumor grade. The ADC and MK sequences produced particularly useful features.

10.1186/s12864-018-5400-8  |  Genetics  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Sugarcane smut is a fungal disease caused by Sporisorium scitamineum. Cultivation of smut-resistant sugarcane varieties is the most effective way to control this disease. The interaction between sugarcane and S. scitamineum is a complex network system. However, to date, there is no report on the identification of microRNA (miRNA) target genes of sugarcane in response to smut pathogen infection by degradome technology. 
  Results:  TaqMan qRT-PCR detection and enzyme activity determination showed that S. scitamineum rapidly proliferated and incurred significant enzyme activity changes in the reactive oxygen species metabolic pathway and phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway at 2 d and 5 d after inoculation, which was the best time points to study target gene degradation during sugarcane and S. scitamineum interaction. A total of 122.33 Mb of raw data was obtained from degradome sequencing analysis of YC05-179 (smut-resistant) and ROC22 (smut-susceptible) after inoculation. The Q30 of each sample was &gt; 93%, and the sequence used for degradation site analysis exactly matched the sugarcane reference sequence. A total of 309 target genes were predicted in sugarcane, corresponding to 97 known miRNAs and 112 novel miRNAs, and 337 degradation sites, suggesting that miRNAs can efficiently direct cleavage at multiple sites in the predicted target mRNAs. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis indicated that the predicted target genes were involved in various regulatory processes, such as signal transduction mechanisms, inorganic ion transport and metabolism, defense mechanisms, translation, posttranslational modifications, energy production and conversion, and glycerolipid metabolism. qRT-PCR analysis of the expression level of 13 predicted target genes and their corresponding miRNAs revealed that there was no obvious negative regulatory relationship between miRNAs and their target genes. In addition, a number of putative resistance-related target genes regulated by miRNA-mediated cleavage were accumulated in sugarcane during S. scitamineum infection, suggesting that feedback regulation of miRNAs may be involved in the response of sugarcane to S. scitamineum infection. 
  Conclusions:  This study elucidates the underlying response of sugarcane to S. scitamineum infection, and also provides a resource for miRNAs and their predicted target genes for smut resistance improvement in sugarcane.

In the present study, 67 putative wheat yellow stripe-like transporter (YSL) proteins belonging to the subfamily of OPT transporters were identified. Phylogeny analysis resulted in the distribution of wheat YSLs into four discrete clades. The highest number of YSLs was present on the A genome and the chromosome 2 of hexaploid wheat. The identified wheat YSL genes showed differential expression in different tissues and during grain development suggesting the importance of this subfamily. Gene expression pattern of TaYSLs during iron starvation experiments suggested an early high transcript accumulation of TaYS1A, TaYS1B, TaYSL3, TaYSL5, and TaYSL6 in roots. In contrast, delayed expression was observed in shoots for TaYS1A, TaYS1B, TaYSL5, TaYSL12, and TaYSL19 as compared to control. Further, their expression under biotic and abiotic response emphasized their alternative functions during the plant growth and development. In conclusion, this work is the first comprehensive study of wheat YSL transporters and would be an important resource for prioritizing genes towards wheat biofortification.

Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms plants use to protect these stresses is the key for plant growth and development. In this study, we mimicked natural stress conditions under a controlled Soil-Plant-Atmosphere-Research (SPAR) system and provided the evidence for how miRNAs regulate target genes under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and drought conditions. Significant physiological and biomass data supported the effective utilization of source-sink (leaf to root) under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Additionally, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> partially rescued the effect of drought on total biomass. We identified both known and novel miRNAs differentially expressed during drought, CO<sub>2</sub>, and combined stress, along with putative targets. A total of 32 conserved miRNAs belonged to 23 miRNA families, and 25 novel miRNAs were identified by deep sequencing. Using the existing sweet potato genome database and stringent analyses, a total of 42 and 22 potential target genes were predicted for the conserved and novel miRNAs, respectively. These target genes are involved in drought response, hormone signaling, photosynthesis, carbon fixation, sucrose and starch metabolism, etc. Gene ontology and KEGG ontology functional enrichment revealed that these miRNAs might target transcription factors (MYB, TCP, NAC), hormone signaling regulators (ARF, AP2/ERF), cold and drought factors (corA), carbon metabolism (ATP synthase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate), and photosynthesis (photosystem I and II complex units). Our study is the first report identifying targets of miRNAs under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels and could support the molecular mechanisms under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> in sweet potato and other crops in the future.

10.3892/mmr.2018.9641  |  Genetics  |  Prognosis, Treatment, Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Numerous studies have revealed that microRNAs (miRNAs) are functional non‑coding RNAs that serve roles in a variety of biological processes. However, the expression patterns and regulatory networks, as well as the miRNAs involved in liver fibrosis remain to be elucidated. In the present study, a mouse model of liver fibrosis was constructed by CCl4 intraperitoneal injection and the total RNAs were extracted from the liver of the mice. The total RNAs were then sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform and an integrated analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in CCl4‑induced liver fibrosis was performed. Compared with normal liver samples, 56 and 15 miRNAs were found to be upregulated and downregulated in fibrotic livers, respectively. To predict the potential functions of these miRNAs, bioinformatics analysis, including Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, was used to assess target mRNAs. The results indicated that the mitogen‑activated protein kinase, phosphoinositide 3 kinase/protein kinase B and focal adhesion signaling pathways were the most significantly enriched. In addition, a regulatory network containing five dysregulated miRNAs and 22 target mRNAs was constructed based on their inverse correlation. Furthermore, the five dysregulated miRNAs were significantly upregulated and the expression of RELB, RAP1A, PPP3CB, MAP2K4, ARRB1, MAP3K4, FGF1 and PRKCB in the network was significantly decreased in LX‑2 cells following TGF‑β1 treatment which suggested that they were associated with the activation of human hepatic stellate cells. The miRNA‑mRNA regulatory network produced in the present study may provide novel insights into the role of miRNAs in liver fibrosis.

10.1016/j.ymeth.2018.11.015  |  Genetics  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   The regulation of gene expression occurs through complex relationships between transcription, processing, turnover, and translation, which are only beginning to be elucidated. We know that at least for certain messenger (m) RNAs, processing, modifications, and sequence elements can greatly influence their translational output through recognition by translation and turn-over machinery. Recently, we and others have combined high-throughput sequencing technologies with traditional biochemical methods of studying translation to extend our understanding of these relationships. Additionally, there is growing importance given to how these processes may be regulated across varied cell types as a means to achieve tissue-specific expression of proteins. Here, we provide an in-depth methodology for polysome profiling to dissect the composition of mRNAs and proteins that make up the translatome from both whole tissues and a specific cell type isolated from mammalian tissue. Also, we provide a detailed computational workflow for the analysis of the next-generation sequencing data generated from these experiments.

10.3892/mmr.2019.10308  |  Genetics  |  Diagnosis, Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   The dental follicle develops into the periodontal ligament, cementum and alveolar bone. Human dental follicle cells (hDFCs) are the precursor cells of periodontal development. Long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been revealed to be crucial factors that regulate a variety of biological processes; however, whether lncRNAs serve a role in human periodontal development remains unknown. Therefore, the present study used microarrays to detect the differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs between hDFCs and human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs). A total of 845 lncRNAs and 1,012 mRNAs were identified to be differentially expressed in hDFCs and hPDLCs (fold change &gt;2.0 or &lt;‑2.0; P&lt;0.05). Microarray data were validated by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Bioinformatics analyses, including gene ontology, pathway analysis and coding‑non‑coding gene co‑expression network analysis, were performed to determine the functions of the differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs. Bioinformatics analysis identified that a number of pathways may be associated with periodontal development, including the p53 and calcium signaling pathways. This analysis also revealed a number of lncRNAs, including NR_033932, T152410, ENST00000512129, ENST00000540293, uc021sxs.1 and ENST00000609146, which may serve important roles in the biological process of hDFCs. In addition, the lncRNA termed maternally expressed 3 (MEG3) was identified to be differentially expressed in hDFCs by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The knockdown of MEG3 was associated with a reduction of pluripotency makers in hDFCs. In conclusion, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, the current study determined the different expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs between hDFCs and hPDLCs. The observations made may provide a solid foundation for further research into the molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs in human periodontal development.

  Methods:  Organoids were derived from resected gastric cancer tumors (huTGOs) or normal stomach tissue collected from sleeve gastrectomies (huFGOs). Organoid cultures were treated with standard-of-care chemotherapeutic drugs corresponding to patient treatment: epirubicin, oxaliplatin, and 5-fluorouracil. Organoid response to chemotherapeutic treatment was correlated with the tumor response in each patient from whom the huTGOs were derived. HuTGOs were orthotopically transplanted into the gastric mucosa of NOD scid gamma mice. 
  Results:  Whereas huFGOs exhibited a half maximal inhibitory concentration that was similar among organoid lines, divergent responses and varying half maximal inhibitory concentration values among the huTGO lines were observed in response to chemotherapeutic drugs. HuTGOs that were sensitive to treatment were derived from a patient with a near complete tumor response to chemotherapy. However, organoids resistant to treatment were derived from patients who exhibited no response to chemotherapy. Orthotropic transplantation of organoids resulted in the engraftment and development of human adenocarcinoma. RNA sequencing revealed that huTGOs closely resembled the patient's native tumor tissue and not commonly used gastric cancer cell lines and cell lines derived from the organoid cultures. 
  Conclusions:  The treatment of patient-derived organoids alongside patients from whom cultures were derived will ultimately test their usefulness to predict individual therapy response and patient outcome.

10.1038/s41440-018-0177-3  |  Prognosis  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Treatment, Genetics  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Review  |   Pre-emptive medicine is a novel medical concept proposed in Japan that aims to precisely predict the onset and progression of diseases and to provide therapeutic interventions during early stages, before symptoms appear. The concept of pre-emptive medicine considers the time-course of a disease in each individual and seeks medical interventions to prevent disease progression. Suitable and promising targets for pre-emptive medicine are non-communicable diseases, including hypertension. Recent advances in genomic analysis, information technology, and artificial intelligence should make this medical concept feasible in the near future. In this review, we focused on pre-emptive medicine for hypertension, referring to concrete plans for the future direction of this research. The ultimate goal of pre-emptive medicine is to completely prevent the onset and progression of hypertension by precisely predicting the elevation of blood pressure and performing interventions to avoid it. The diagnostic processes of hypertension, from the standpoint of pre-emptive medicine, should include the detection of abnormal blood pressure regulation as the earliest manifestation of the disease, the depiction of the present status of hypertension in an individual ("nowcasting"), and a prediction of the future trajectory of the disease ("forecasting"). Novel therapeutic strategies for hypertension, from the standpoint of pre-emptive medicine, should aim for the regression of hypertension through early treatments and the remission of hypertension through intermittent intensive therapies. An efficient modification of lifestyle and therapies, according to the progression of hypertension, should be required. If pre-emptive medicine for hypertension becomes established, it would greatly contribute to the extension of a healthy lifespan, which cannot yet be satisfactorily achieved.

Technical developments enable ever more detailed insights into disease processes and enable a precise, multimodal diagnosis of even complex diseases using digital imaging, cardiac biomarkers and genomic information. The rapid availability of this data, often in real time, allows optimized planning and performing of tailored interventional, surgical, or pharmacotherapies. But there are also completely new challenges due to the growing flood of data, the integration of which can no longer be achieved by the individual doctor. The active involvement and participation of the patient also requires new digital concepts and should include decision-making, treatment planning, (long-term) history, and feedback on success and adverse drug reactions. By using artificial intelligence, digital communication and decision support systems, economic benefits, quality improvements and acceleration of outpatient and inpatient treatment become possible.The DGK supports these developments in its own activities, both in project planning, communication with specialist groups, and in training and education.

  Methods:  We recruited 20 patients with coronary artery disease who underwent repeated hybrid PET/CT angiography (CTA) imaging within 3 weeks. All patients had 30-min PET acquisition and CTA during a single imaging session. Five PET image-sets with progressive motion correction were reconstructed: (i) a static dataset (no-MC), (ii) end-diastolic PET (standard), (iii) cardiac motion corrected (MC), (iv) combined cardiac and gross patient motion corrected (2 × MC) and, (v) cardiorespiratory and gross patient motion corrected (3 × MC). In addition to motion correction, all datasets were corrected for variations in the background activities which are introduced by variations in the injection-to-scan delays (background blood pool clearance correction, BC). Test-retest reproducibility of PET target-to-background ratio (TBR) was assessed by Bland-Altman analysis and coefficient of reproducibility. 
  Results:  A total of 47 unique coronary lesions were identified on CTA. Motion correction in combination with BC improved the PET TBR test-retest reproducibility for all lesions (coefficient of reproducibility: standard = 0.437, no-MC = 0.345 (27% improvement), standard + BC = 0.365 (20% improvement), no-MC + BC = 0.341 (27% improvement), MC + BC = 0.288 (52% improvement), 2 × MC + BC = 0.278 (57% improvement) and 3 × C + BC = 0.254 (72% improvement), all p &lt; 0.001). Importantly, in a sub-analysis of <sup>18</sup>F-NaF-avid lesions with gross patient motion &gt; 10 mm following corrections, reproducibility was improved by 133% (coefficient of reproducibility: standard = 0.745, 3 × MC = 0.320). 
  Conclusion:  Joint corrections for cardiac, respiratory, and gross patient motion in combination with background blood pool corrections markedly improve test-retest reproducibility of coronary <sup>18</sup>F-NaF PET.

In order to obtain detailed information about the pathogenesis and host immune response in a PEDV-infected host for first In vivo study we used high-throughput sequencing to analyze the gene expression differences of the small intestinal mucosa after infection with PEDV. Transcripts obtained were over 65,525,000 clean reads after reassembly were 22,605 genes detected, of which 22,248 were known genes and 371 new genes were predicted. Moreover, 3168 genes expression was up-regulated and 3876 genes down-regulated. (Gene Ontology) GO annotation and functional enrichment analysis indicated that all of the DEGs (differentially expressed genes) were annotated into biological process, cellular component and molecular function. Most of these unigenes are annotated in cellular processes, the cell and binding. KEGG analysis of the DEGs showed that a total of 7044 DEGs unigenes were annotated into 323 pathways classified into 6 main categories. Most of these unigenes are annotated were related to immune system response to the infectious diseases pathways. In addition, 20 DEGs were verified by quantitative real-time PCR. As the first, in vivo, RNAseq analysis of piglets and PEDV infection, our study provides knowledge about the transcriptomics of intestinal mucosa in PEDV-infected piglets, from which a complex molecular pathways and pathogenesis-related biological processes are involved in PEDV interaction with piglet intestinal mucosa.

Practical drought hazard mapping remains challenging due to possible exclusion of the most pertinent drought drivers, and to the use of inadequate predictive models that cannot describe drought adequately. This research aims to develop new approaches to map agricultural drought hazard with state-of-the-art machine learning models, including classification and regression trees (CART), boosted regression trees (BRT), random forests (RF), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), flexible discriminant analysis (FDA) and support vector machines (SVM). Hydro-environmental datasets were used to calculate the relative departure of soil moisture (RDSM) for eight severe droughts for drought-prone southeast Queensland, Australia, over the period 1994-2013. RDSM was then used to generate an agricultural drought inventory map. Eight hydro-environmental factors were used as potential predictors of drought. The goodness-of-fit and predictive performance of all models were evaluated using different threshold-dependent and threshold-independent methods, including the true skill statistic (TSS), Efficiency (E), F-score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). The RF model (AUC-ROC = 97.7%, TSS = 0.873, E = 0.929, F-score = 0.898) yielded the highest accuracy, while the FDA model (with AUC-ROC = 73.9%, TSS = 0.424, E = 0.719, F-score = 0.512) showed the worst performance. The plant available water holding capacity (PAWC), mean annual precipitation, and clay content were the most important variables to be used for predicting the agricultural drought. About 21.2% of the area is in high or very high drought risk classes, and therefore, warrant drought and environmental protection policies. Importantly, the models do not require data on the precipitation anomaly for any given drought year; the spatial patterns in AGH were consistent for all drought events, despite very different spatial patterns in precipitation anomaly among events. Such machine-learning approaches are able to construct an overall risk map, thus assisting in the adoption of a robust drought contingency planning measure not only for this area, but also, in other regions where drought presents a pressing challenge, including its influence on key practical dimensions of social, environmental and economic sustainability.

Therefore, identifying novel biomarkers for ccRCC patients is crucial. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this study, we obtained RNA sequencing data and clinical information from the TCGA database. Subsequently, we performed integrated bioinformatic analysis that includes differently expressed genes analysis, gene ontology and KEGG pathway analysis, protein-protein interaction analysis, and survival analysis. Moreover, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were constructed. RESULTS As a result, we identified a total of 263 dysregulated genes that may participate in the metastasis of ccRCC, and established a predictive signature relying on the expression of OTX1, MATN4, PI3, ERVV-2, and NFE4, which could serve as significant progressive and prognostic biomarkers for ccRCC. CONCLUSIONS We identified differentially expressed genes that may be involved in the metastasis of ccRCC. Moreover, a predictive signature based on the expression of OTX1, MATN4, PI3, ERVV-2, and NFE4 could be an independent prognostic factor for ccRCC.

Thus, we aimed to create a CT-based radiomic model to predict early recurrence in AGC patients preoperatively. 
  Materials and methods:  We enrolled 669 consecutive patients (302 in the training set, 219 in the internal test set and 148 in the external test set) with clinicopathologically confirmed AGC from two centers. Radiomic features were extracted from preoperative diagnostic CT images. Machine learning methods were applied to shrink feature size and build a predictive radiomic signature. We incorporated the radiomic signature and clinical risk factors into a nomogram using multivariable logistic regression analysis. The area under the curve (AUC) of operating characteristics (ROC), accuracy, and calibration curves were assessed to evaluate the nomogram's performance in discriminating early recurrence. 
  Results:  A radiomic signature, including three hand crafted features and six deep learning features, was significantly associated with early recurrence (p-value &lt;0.0001 for all sets). In addition, clinical N stage, carbohydrate antigen 199 levels, carcinoembryonic antigen levels, and Borrmann type were considered useful predictors for early recurrence. The nomogram, combining all these predictors, showed powerful prognostic ability in the training set and two test sets with AUCs of 0.831 (95% CI, 0.786-0.876), 0.826 (0.772-0.880) and 0.806 (0.732-0.881), respectively. The predicted risk yielded good agreement with the observed recurrence probability. 
  Conclusions:  By incorporating a radiomic signature and clinical risk factors, we created a radiomic nomogram to predict early recurrence in patients with AGC, preoperatively, which may serve as a potential tool to guide personalized treatment.

10.3390/s19214788  |  None  |  Diagnosis, Smart Healthcare  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   In an Internet of Things (IoT) system, it is essential that the data measured from the sensors are accurate so that the produced results are meaningful. For example, in AgriTalk, a smart farm platform for soil cultivation with a large number of sensors, the produced sensor data are used in several Artificial Intelligence (AI) models to provide precise farming for soil microbiome and fertility, disease regulation, irrigation regulation, and pest regulation. It is important that the sensor data are correctly used in AI modeling. Unfortunately, no sensor is perfect. Even for the sensors manufactured from the same factory, they may yield different readings. This paper proposes a solution called SensorTalk to automatically detect potential sensor failures and calibrate the aging sensors semi-automatically. Numerical examples are given to show the calibration tables for temperature and humidity sensors. When the sensors control the actuators, the SensorTalk solution can also detect whether a failure occurs within a detection delay. Both analytic and simulation models are proposed to appropriately select the detection delay so that, when a potential failure occurs, it is detected reasonably early without incurring too many false alarms. Specifically, our selection can limit the false detection probability to be less than 0.7%.

10.1016/j.ophtha.2019.12.004  |  Prognosis  |  Prognosis  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Purpose:  To quantify the central visual field (VF) loss patterns in glaucoma using artificial intelligence. 
  Design:  Retrospective study. 
  Participants:  VFs of 8712 patients with 13 951 Humphrey 10-2 test results from 13 951 eyes for cross-sectional analyses, and 824 patients with at least 5 reliable 10-2 test results at 6-month intervals or more from 1191 eyes for longitudinal analyses. 
  Methods:  Total deviation values were used to determine the central VF patterns using the most recent 10-2 test results. A 24-2 VF within a 3-month window of the 10-2 tests was used to stage eyes into mild, moderate, or severe functional loss using the Hodapp-Anderson-Parrish scale at baseline. Archetypal analysis was applied to determine the central VF patterns. Cross-validation was performed to determine the optimal number of patterns. Stepwise regression was applied to select the optimal feature combination of global indices, average baseline decomposition coefficients from central VFs archetypes, and other factors to predict central VF mean deviation (MD) slope based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). 
  Main outcome measures:  The central VF patterns stratified by severity stage based on 24-2 test results and a model to predict the central VF MD change over time using baseline test results. 
  Results:  From cross-sectional analysis, 17 distinct central VF patterns were determined for the 13 951 eyes across the spectrum of disease severity. These central VF patterns could be divided into isolated superior loss, isolated inferior loss, diffuse loss, and other loss patterns. Notably, 4 of the 5 patterns of diffuse VF loss preserved the less vulnerable inferotemporal zone, whereas they lost most of the remaining more vulnerable zone described by the Hood model. Inclusion of coefficients from central VF archetypical patterns strongly improved the prediction of central VF MD slope (BIC decrease, 35; BIC decrease of &gt;6 indicating strong prediction improvement) than using only the global indices of 2 baseline VF results. Eyes with baseline VF results with more superonasal and inferonasal loss were more likely to show worsening MD over time. 
  Conclusions:  We quantified central VF patterns in glaucoma, which were used to improve the prediction of central VF worsening compared with using only global indices.

In this work, two relaying protocols, so-called time-switching-based relaying WSN-NOMA (TSR WSN-NOMA) and power-splitting-based relaying WSN-NOMA (PSR WSN-NOMA) are deployed to study energy-harvesting (EH). Regarding the system performance analysis, we obtain the closed-form expressions for the exact and approximate outage probability (OP) in both protocols, and the delay-limited throughput is also evaluated. We then compare the two protocols theoretically, and two optimization problems are formulated to reduce the impact of OP and optimize the data rate. Our numerical and simulation results are provided to prove the theoretical and analytical analysis. Thanks to these results, a great performance gain can be achieved for both TSR WSN-NOMA and PSR WSN-NOMA if optimal values of TS and PS ratios are found. In addition, the optimized TSR WSN-NOMA outperforms that of PSR WSN-NOMA in terms of OP.

10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2019.104068  |  Prognosis, Treatment  |  Prognosis, Treatment  |  SVM, Naive Bayes, Boosted Decision Tree, Decision Forest  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  The proper estimate of the risk of recurrences in early-stage oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) is mandatory for individual treatment-decision making. However, this remains a challenge even for experienced multidisciplinary centers. 
  Objectives:  We compared the performance of four machine learning (ML) algorithms for predicting the risk of locoregional recurrences in patients with OTSCC. These algorithms were Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Boosted Decision Tree (BDT), and Decision Forest (DF). 
  Materials and methods:  The study cohort comprised 311 cases from the five University Hospitals in Finland and A.C. Camargo Cancer Center, São Paulo, Brazil. For comparison of the algorithms, we used the harmonic mean of precision and recall called F1 score, specificity, and accuracy values. These algorithms and their corresponding permutation feature importance (PFI) with the input parameters were externally tested on 59 new cases. Furthermore, we compared the performance of the algorithm that showed the highest prediction accuracy with the prognostic significance of depth of invasion (DOI). 
  Results:  The results showed that the average specificity of all the algorithms was 71% . The SVM showed an accuracy of 68% and F1 score of 0.63, NB an accuracy of 70% and F1 score of 0.64, BDT an accuracy of 81% and F1 score of 0.78, and DF an accuracy of 78% and F1 score of 0.70. Additionally, these algorithms outperformed the DOI-based approach, which gave an accuracy of 63%. With PFI-analysis, there was no significant difference in the overall accuracies of three of the algorithms; PFI-BDT accuracy increased to 83.1%, PFI-DF increased to 80%, PFI-SVM decreased to 64.4%, while PFI-NB accuracy increased significantly to 81.4%. 
  Conclusions:  Our findings show that the best classification accuracy was achieved with the boosted decision tree algorithm. Additionally, these algorithms outperformed the DOI-based approach. Furthermore, with few parameters identified in the PFI analysis, ML technique still showed the ability to predict locoregional recurrence. The application of boosted decision tree machine learning algorithm can stratify OTSCC patients and thus aid in their individual treatment planning.

  Methods:  RNA sequencing data, radiomics features and clinical parameters of 62 BLCA patients were included in the study. Then, prognostic signatures based on radiomics features and gene expression profile were constructed by using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox analysis. A multi-omics nomogram was developed by integrating radiomics, transcriptomics and clinicopathological data. More importantly, radiomics risk score-related genes were identified via weighted correlation network analysis and submitted to functional enrichment analysis. 
  Results:  The radiomics and transcriptomics signatures significantly stratified BLCA patients into high- and low-risk groups in terms of the progression-free interval (PFI). The two risk models remained independent prognostic factors in multivariate analyses after adjusting for clinical parameters. A nomogram was developed and showed an excellent predictive ability for the PFI in BLCA patients. Functional enrichment analysis suggested that the radiomics signature we developed could reflect the angiogenesis status of BLCA patients. 
  Conclusions:  The integrative nomogram incorporated CECT radiomics, transcriptomics and clinical features improved the PFI prediction in BLCA patients and is a feasible and practical reference for oncological precision medicine. 
  Key points:  • Our radiomics and transcriptomics models are proved robust for survival prediction in bladder urothelial carcinoma patients. • A multi-omics nomogram model which integrates radiomics, transcriptomics and clinical features for prediction of progression-free interval in bladder urothelial carcinoma is established. • Molecular functional enrichment analysis is used to reveal the potential molecular function of radiomics signature.

Unsupervised machine learning, as opposed to supervised learning, has shown promise in identifying novel patterns and relations from EHRs without using human created labels. In this paper, we investigate the application of unsupervised machine learning models in discovering latent disease clusters and patient subgroups based on EHRs. We utilized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model, and proposed a novel model named Poisson Dirichlet Model (PDM), which extends the LDA approach using a Poisson distribution to model patients' disease diagnoses and to alleviate age and sex factors by considering both observed and expected observations. In the empirical experiments, we evaluated LDA and PDM on three patient cohorts, namely Osteoporosis, Delirium/Dementia, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)/Bronchiectasis Cohorts, with their EHR data retrieved from the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) medical records linkage system, for the discovery of latent disease clusters and patient subgroups. We compared the effectiveness of LDA and PDM in identifying disease clusters through the visualization of disease representations. We tested the performance of LDA and PDM in differentiating patient subgroups through survival analysis, as well as statistical analysis of demographics and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI) scores in those subgroups. The experimental results show that the proposed PDM could effectively identify distinguished disease clusters based on the latent patterns hidden in the EHR data by alleviating the impact of age and sex, and that LDA could stratify patients into differentiable subgroups with larger p-values than PDM. However, those subgroups identified by LDA are highly associated with patients' age and sex. The subgroups discovered by PDM might imply the underlying patterns of diseases of greater interest in epidemiology research due to the alleviation of age and sex. Both unsupervised machine learning approaches could be leveraged to discover patient subgroups using EHRs but with different foci.

This individualization should be kept in mind during the main decision points that occur before and during treatment. Treatment customization must include consideration of both the woman and her partner involved in the process together, including their collective treatment goals. Once treatment goals have been agreed and diagnostic evaluations performed, personalization based on patient characteristics, together with an understanding of treatment goals and patient preferences, enables the selection of appropriate treatments, protocols, products and their dosing. Following treatment initiation, monitoring and adaptation of product and dose can then ensure optimal outcomes. Currently, it is not possible to base treatment decisions on every characteristic of the patient and personalization is based on biomarkers that have been identified as the most relevant. However, in the future, the use of artificial intelligence coupled with continuous monitoring should enable greater individualization and improve outcomes. This review considers the current state-of-the-art related to decision points during individualized treatment of female infertility, before looking at future developments that might further assist in making individualized treatment decisions, including the use of computer-assisted decision making.

10.1016/j.media.2019.101625  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Treatment  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   The accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its early stage, e.g., mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is essential for timely treatment or possible intervention to slow down AD progression. Recent studies have demonstrated that multiple neuroimaging and biological measures contain complementary information for diagnosis and prognosis. Therefore, information fusion strategies with multi-modal neuroimaging data, such as voxel-based measures extracted from structural MRI (VBM-MRI) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), have shown their effectiveness for AD diagnosis. However, most existing methods are proposed to simply integrate the multi-modal data, but do not make full use of structure information across the different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal neuroimaging feature selection method with consistent metric constraint (MFCC) for AD analysis. First, the similarity is calculated for each modality (i.e. VBM-MRI or FDG-PET) individually by random forest strategy, which can extract pairwise similarity measures for multiple modalities. Then the group sparsity regularization term and the sample similarity constraint regularization term are used to constrain the objective function to conduct feature selection from multiple modalities. Finally, the multi-kernel support vector machine (MK-SVM) is used to fuse the features selected from different models for final classification. The experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) show that the proposed method has better classification performance than the start-of-the-art multimodality-based methods. Specifically, we achieved higher accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) for AD versus normal controls (NC), MCI versus NC, and MCI converters (MCI-C) versus MCI non-converters (MCI-NC) on ADNI datasets. Therefore, the proposed model not only outperforms the traditional method in terms of AD/MCI classification, but also discovers the characteristics associated with the disease, demonstrating its promise for improving disease-related mechanistic understanding.

In the past few years, one of the deep learning algorithms, the recurrent neural network (RNN), has shown an outstanding ability in sequence labeling and prediction tasks for sequential data. We built a reliable visual field prediction algorithm using RNN and evaluated its performance in comparison with the conventional pointwise ordinary linear regression (OLR) method. A total of 1,408 eyes were used as a training dataset and another dataset, comprising 281 eyes, was used as a test dataset. Five consecutive visual field tests were provided to the constructed RNN as input and a 6<sup>th</sup> visual field test was compared with the output of the RNN. The performance of the RNN was compared with that of OLR by predicting the 6<sup>th</sup> visual field in the test dataset. The overall prediction performance of RNN was significantly better than OLR. The pointwise prediction error of the RNN was significantly smaller than that of the OLR in most areas known to be vulnerable to glaucomatous damage. The RNN was also more robust and reliable regarding worsening in the visual field examination. In clinical practice, the RNN model can therefore assist in decision-making for further treatment of glaucoma.

10.1037/xge0000630  |  Diagnosis  |  Prognosis, Treatment  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Creative thinking drives progress not only in the arts but also, and perhaps especially, in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, and it is expected to become even more valuable than technical skill as artificial intelligence outpaces human cognition. Fostering creative thinkers has become a primary focus of educators. Educationally relevant anxieties, like math anxiety, have been shown to substantially impact specific forms of achievement and engagement, both in school and in career pursuits. Identifying these anxieties has led to promising interventions to enable affected individuals to reach their potential. Somewhat surprisingly, however, the possibility of anxiety specific to creative thinking is, to our knowledge, unexplored. In this article, across multiple samples, we tested the viability of creativity anxiety as a construct. We first created a new measure, the Creativity Anxiety Scale (CAS), demonstrating validity, internal reliability, and specificity. Applying the CAS revealed that creativity-specific anxiety predicted individual differences in creative achievement and attitudes toward creativity over and above effects of general anxiety. Moreover, across diverse content domains, from science to arts, anxiety was greater for situations that required creativity than similar situations that did not. Notably, this effect was especially pronounced in women. These findings suggest that creativity anxiety may have wide-reaching impacts and distinguish creativity anxiety from anxiety about noncreative aspects of performance. Establishing creativity anxiety as a novel construct, and the CAS as a valid measurement instrument, opens a new avenue of research that promises to deepen basic understanding of creative cognition and inform development of interventions to enable greater achievement of creative potential.

With this article, we reflect on how to assimilate the tsunami of ICIs data into clinical practice. 
  Recent findings:  A tremendous increase on approvals, number of publications, and clinical trials ongoing with ICIs on many different tumor types. 
  Summary:  ICIs are innovative treatments that are showing a significant benefit on different tumors. More approvals and an explosive increase of knowledge around the usage of ICI are to be expected in the near future, bringing new challenges on how to integrate this fast-growing evidence with ICI into clinical practice. To be updated, oncologists could follow approved guidelines from relevant societies and complement it with an appropriate search from publication databases. There are also some available courses, conferences and online material that are useful to improve knowledge in this so rapidly changing environment. In the future, we believe the integration of artificial intelligence and learning machines will play an important role to facilitate best clinical practices in different fields of medicine but particularly for oncology.

An all-out effort is underway to better understand the basic biologic mechanisms of this disease ranging from early development to metastatic disease. In order to change the course of this disease, diagnostic radiology imaging may play a vital role in providing a precise, noninvasive method for early diagnosis and assessment of treatment response. Recent progress in combining medical imaging, advanced image analysis and artificial intelligence, termed radiomics, can offer an innovate approach in detecting the earliest changes of tumor development as well as a rapid method for the detection of response. In this chapter, we introduce the principles of radiomics and demonstrate how it can provide additional information into tumor biology, early detection, and response assessments advancing the goals of precision imaging to deliver the right treatment to the right person at the right time.

In this work, we design an artificial intelligent signal amplification (AISA) system including double-stranded SQ (S, signal strand; Q, quencher strand) and FP (F, fuel strand; P, protect strand) according to thermodynamics principle for sensitive detection of miRNA <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. In this AISA system for miRNA detection, strand S carries a quenched imaging marker inside the SQ. Target miRNA is constantly replaced by a reaction intermediate and circulatively participates in the reaction, similar to enzyme. Therefore, abundant fluorescent substances from S and SP are dissociated from excessive SQ for <i>in vitro and in vivo</i> visualization. The versatility and feasibility for disease diagnosis using this system were demonstrated by constructing two types of AISA system to detect Hsa-miR-484 and Hsa-miR-100, respectively. The minimum target concentration detected by the system <i>in vitro</i> (10 min after mixing) was 1/10th that of the control group. The precancerous lesions of liver cancer were diagnosed, and the detection accuracy were larger than 94% both in terms of location and concentration. The ability to establish this design framework for AISA system with high specificity provides a new way to monitor tumor progression and to assess therapeutic responses.

The subjective effects elicited by dissociative drugs acting as N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists (e.g. ketamine and phencyclidine) overlap in certain domains with those of serotonergic psychedelics, suggesting some potential similarities in the brain activity patterns induced by both classes of drugs, despite different pharmacological mechanisms of action. We investigated source-localized magnetoencephalography recordings to determine the frequency-specific changes in oscillatory activity and long-range functional coupling that are common to two serotonergic compounds (lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD] and psilocybin) and the NMDA-antagonist ketamine. Administration of the three drugs resulted in widespread and broadband spectral power reductions. We established their similarity by using different pairs of compounds to train and subsequently evaluate multivariate machine learning classifiers. After applying the same methodology to functional connectivity values, we observed a pattern of occipital, parietal and frontal decreases in the low alpha and theta bands that were specific to LSD and psilocybin, as well as decreases in the low beta band common to the three drugs. Our results represent a first effort in the direction of quantifying the similarity of large-scale brain activity patterns induced by drugs of different mechanism of action, confirming the link between changes in theta and alpha oscillations and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> agonism, while also revealing the decoupling of activity in the beta band as an effect shared between NMDA antagonists and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> agonists. We discuss how these frequency-specific convergences and divergences in the power and functional connectivity of brain oscillations might relate to the overlapping subjective effects of serotonergic psychedelics and glutamatergic dissociative compounds.

However, shortcomings still exist in treatments. The aim of this study was to identify the efficacy and potential mechanism of gypenosides in the treatment of thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy. The Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform was screened for active compounds of gypenosides, and targets were predicted using Swiss Target Prediction. The targets of thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy were obtained from Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, Comparative Toxicogenomic Database and GeneCards Human gene database. Gene Ontology (GO), the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Reactome Pathways were determined based on the common targets. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to further understand of relationship among target genes, compounds and proteins. Molecular docking was performed to investigate the binding ability between gypenosides and hub genes. A total of 70 targets for gypenosides and 804 targets for thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy were obtained with 8 common targets identified. GO analysis and KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the hub genes were enriched in JAK-STAT, while Reactome pathways analysis indicated genes enriched in interleukin pathways. PPI network showed STAT1, STAT3, and STAT4 were at the center. Additionally, molecular docking indicated that STAT1 and STAT3 display good binding forces with gypenosides. This study indicates that target genes mainly enriched in JAK-STAT signaling pathway, particularly in STATs, which can be combined with gypenosides. This may suggest that gypenosides have curative effect on thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy via the JAK-STAT pathway.

10.1007/s11255-018-2044-1  |  Other  |  Genetics  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Purpose:  The purpose of the study was to assess the differences in the concentration and function of urinary proteins between patients with cystine stones (CYS) and healthy controls (HC). We postulated that CYS and HC groups would demonstrate different proteomic profiles. 
  Methods:  A pilot study was performed comparing urinary proteomes of 10 patients with CYS and 10 age- and gender-matched HC, using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Proteins which met the selection criteria (i) ≥ 2 unique peptide identifications; (ii) ≥ twofold difference in protein abundance; and (iii) ≤ 0.05 p value for the Fisher's Exact Test were analyzed using Gene Ontology classifications. 
  Results:  Of the 2097 proteins identified by proteomic analysis, 398 proteins were significantly different between CYS and HC. Of those, 191 were involved in transport processes and 61 in inflammatory responses. The majority were vesicle-mediated transport proteins (78.5%), and 1/3 of them were down-regulated; of those, 12 proteins were involved in endosomal transport (including 6 charged multivesicular body proteins (CHMP) and 3 vacuolar sorting-associated proteins) and 9 in transmembrane transport. Myosin-2 and two actin-related proteins were significantly up-regulated in the vesicle-mediated transport group. 
  Conclusion:  We provide proteomic evidence of impaired endocytosis, dysregulation of actin and myosin cytoskeleton, and inflammation in CYS. Endosomal transport proteins were down-regulated mainly through defective CHMP. These findings may contribute to further understanding of the pathogenesis of CYS, potentially affecting its management.

10.2214/AJR.18.20443  |  Prognosis  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Genetics  |  ANN, Random Forest  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Objective:  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential value of machine learning (ML)-based high-dimensional quantitative CT texture analysis in predicting the mutation status of the gene encoding the protein polybromo-1 (PBRM1) in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC). 
  Materials and methods:  In this retrospective study, 45 patients with clear cell RCC (29 without the PBRM1 mutation and 16 with the PBRM1 mutation) were identified in The Cancer Genome Atlas-Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma database. To create stable ML models and balanced classes, the data were augmented to a total of 161 labeled segmentations (87 without the PBRM1 mutation and 74 with the PBRM1 mutation) by obtaining three to five different samples per patient. Texture features were extracted from corticomedullary phase contrast-enhanced CT images with the use of an open-source software package for the extraction of radiomic data from medical images. Reproducibility analysis (intraclass correlation) was performed by two radiologists. Attribute selection and model optimization were done using a wrapper-based classifier-specific algorithm with nested cross-validation. ML classifiers were an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm and a random forest (RF) algorithm. The models were validated using 10-fold cross-validation. The reference standard was the PBRM1 mutation status. The main performance metric was the AUC value. 
  Results:  Of 828 extracted texture features, 759 had excellent reproducibility. Using 10 selected features, the ANN algorithm correctly classified 88.2% (142 of 161) of the clear cell RCCs in terms of PBRM1 mutation status (AUC value, 0.925). Using five selected features, the RF algorithm correctly classified 95.0% (153 of 161) of the clear cell RCCs (AUC value, 0.987). Overall, the RF algorithm performed better than the ANN algorithm (z score = -2.677; p = 0.007). 
  Conclusion:  ML-based high-dimensional quantitative CT texture analysis might be a feasible and potential method for predicting PBRM1 mutation status in patients with clear cell RCC.

Sometimes, this leads to systemic host colonization over long time scales without macroscopic symptoms. However, how plant-pathogenic endophytes manage to establish their sustained systemic infection remains largely unknown. Here, we present a genomic and transcriptomic analysis of Thecaphora thlaspeos. This relative of the well studied grass smut Ustilago maydis is the only smut fungus adapted to Brassicaceae hosts. Its ability to overwinter with perennial hosts and its systemic plant infection including roots are unique characteristics among smut fungi. The T. thlaspeos genome was assembled to the chromosome level. It is a typical smut genome in terms of size and genome characteristics. In silico prediction of candidate effector genes revealed common smut effector proteins and unique members. For three candidates, we have functionally demonstrated effector activity. One of these, TtTue1, suggests a potential link to cold acclimation. On the plant side, we found evidence for a typical immune response as it is present in other infection systems, despite the absence of any macroscopic symptoms during infection. Our findings suggest that T. thlaspeos distinctly balances its virulence during biotrophic growth ultimately allowing for long-lived infection of its perennial hosts.

10.1371/journal.pone.0214857  |  Treatment  |  Treatment, Genetics  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease. In recent years, considerable evidence has indicated that Gene Ontology (GO) functions, especially GO-biological processes, have important effects on the mechanisms and treatments of different diseases. However, the roles of GO functions in the pathogenesis and treatment of MG have not been well studied. This study aimed to uncover the potential important roles of risk-related GO functions and to screen significant candidate drugs related to GO functions for MG. Based on MG risk genes, 238 risk GO functions and 42 drugs were identified. Through constructing a GO function network, we discovered that positive regulation of NF-kappaB transcription factor activity (GO:0051092) may be one of the most important GO functions in the mechanism of MG. Furthermore, we built a drug-GO function network to help evaluate the latent relationship between drugs and GO functions. According to the drug-GO function network, 5 candidate drugs showing promise for treating MG were identified. Indeed, 2 out of 5 candidate drugs have been investigated to treat MG. Through functional enrichment analysis, we found that the mechanisms between 5 candidate drugs and associated GO functions may involve two vital pathways, specifically hsa05332 (graft-versus-host disease) and hsa04940 (type I diabetes mellitus). More interestingly, most of the processes in these two pathways were consistent. Our study will not only reveal a new perspective on the mechanisms and novel treatment strategies of MG, but also will provide strong support for research on GO functions.

The side-form general antioxidant function-specific role of each Msr isoform has not been fully studied. Thirty homologous genes of Msr type A (MsrA) and type B (MsrB) that originate from the genomes of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, <i>Populus trichocarpa,</i> and <i>Oryza sativa</i> were analyzed in silico. From 109 to 201 transcription factors and responsive elements were predicted for each gene. Among the species, 220 and 190 common transcription factors and responsive elements were detected for the <i>MsrA</i> and <i>MsrB</i> isoforms, respectively. In a comparison of 14 <i>MsrA</i> and 16 <i>MsrB</i> genes, 424 transcription factors and responsive elements were reported in both types of genes, with almost ten times fewer unique elements. The transcription factors mainly comprised plant growth and development regulators, transcription factors important in stress responses with significant overrepresentation of the myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (MYB) and no apical meristem, Arabidopsis transcription activation factor and cup-shaped cotyledon (NAC) families and responsive elements sensitive to ethylene, jasmonate, sugar, and prolamine. Gene Ontology term-based functional classification revealed that cellular, metabolic, and developmental process terms and the response to stimulus term dominated in the biological process category. Available experimental transcriptomic and proteomic data, in combination with a set of predictions, gave coherent results validating this research. Thus, new manners <i>Msr</i> gene expression regulation, as well as new putative roles of Msrs, are proposed.

Studies on coding and non-coding RNAs are needed to determine the molecular mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS To explore the potential roles of miRNAs and mRNA in OS, we determined the miRNA and mRNA expression profile of 3 pairs of OS and paracancerous tissues from patients with OS by sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. The expression levels of critical miRNAs and mRNAs were verified in 10 pairs of OS and paracancerous tissues. An miRNA inhibitor and mimics were used to investigate the interactions between miRNAs and target genes. The cell counting kit-8 assay was performed to evaluate OS cell proliferation after miRNA interference. RESULTS A total of 184 miRNAs and 2501 mRNAs were identified (fold-change &gt;2.0 or &lt;2.0, P&lt;0.05), with up-regulation of 82 miRNAs and 1320 mRNAs and down-regulation of 102 miRNAs and 1181 mRNAs in OS tissue. The protein protein interaction network revealed that UQCRC1 (ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core protein 1) is a critical gene and a potential target gene of miR-214-3p. Both UQCRC1 and miR-214-3p were significantly differentially expressed in OS tissue and cell lines (down and up-regulated, respectively). Down-regulated miR-214-3p expression increased UQCRC1 expression and suppressed OS cell proliferation. In contrast, overexpression of miR-214-3p decreased UQCRC1 expression and promoted OS cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS High miR-214-3p expression may promote OS cell proliferation by targeting UQCRC1, providing insight into a potential therapeutic target for preventing and treating OS.

Increasing evidence indicates that microRNA (miRNA)-mRNA axis is involved in HCC. However, a comprehensive miRNA-mRNA regulatory network in HBV-related HCC is still absent. This study aims to identify potential miRNA-mRNA regulatory pathways contributing to pathogenesis of HBV-related HCC. 
  Methods:  Microarray GSE69580 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. GEO2R and 'R-limma' were used to conduct differential expression analysis. The common miRNAs appeared in the two analytic sets were screened as potential differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs). The prognostic roles of screened DE-miRNAs in HCC were further evaluated using Kaplan-Meier plotter database. Target genes of DE-miRNAs were predicted by miRNet. Then, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were established for these targets via the STRING database, after which hub genes in the networks were identified by Cytoscape. Functional annotation and pathway enrichment analyses for the target genes were performed through DAVID database. Three enriched pathways related to HBV-related HCC were selected for further analysis and potential target genes commonly appeared in all three pathways were screened. Cytoscape was employed to construct miRNA-hub gene network. The expression and correlation of potential miRNAs and targets were further detected in clinical HBV-related HCC samples by qRT-PCR. 
  Results:  7 upregulated and 9 downregulated DE-miRNAs were accessed. 5 of 7 upregulated DE-miRNAs and 5 of 7 downregulated DE-miRNAs indicated significant prognostic roles in HCC. 2312 and 1175 target genes were predicted for the upregulated and downregulated DE-miRNAs, respectively. TP53 was identified as the hub gene in the PPI networks. Pathway enrichment analysis suggested that these predicted targets were linked to hepatitis B, pathways in cancer, microRNAs in cancer and viral carcinogenesis. Further analysis of these pathways screened 20 and 16 target genes for upregulated and downregulated DE-miRNAs, respectively. By detecting the expression of 36 target genes, six candidate target genes were identified. Finally, a potential miRNA-mRNA regulatory network was established based on the results of qRT-PCR and expression correlation analysis. 
  Conclusions:  In the study, potential miRNA-mRNA regulatory pathways were identified, exploring the underlying pathogenesis and effective therapy strategy of HBV-related HCC.

10.1371/journal.pone.0223173  |  None  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Sugar transporters play a crucial role for plant productivity, as they coordinate sugar fluxes from source leaf towards sink organs (seed, fruit, root) and regulate the supply of carbon resources towards the microorganisms of the rhizosphere (bacteria and fungi). Thus, sugar fluxes mediated by SUT (sucrose transporters), MST (monosaccharide transporters) and SWEET (sugar will eventually be exported transporters) families are key determinants of crop yield and shape the microbial communities living in the soil. In this work, we performed a systematic search for sugar transporters in Fabaceae genomes, focusing on model and agronomical plants. Here, we update the inventory of sugar transporter families mining the latest version of the Medicago truncatula genome and identify for the first time SUT MST and SWEET families of the agricultural crop Pisum sativum. The sugar transporter families of these Fabaceae species comprise respectively 7 MtSUT 7 PsSUT, 72 MtMST 59 PsMST and 26 MtSWEET 22 PsSWEET. Our comprehensive phylogenetic analysis sets a milestone for the scientific community, as we propose a new and simple nomenclature to correctly name SUT MST and SWEET families. Then, we searched for transcriptomic data available for our gene repertoire. We show that several clusters of homologous genes are co-expressed in different organs, suggesting that orthologous sugar transporters may have a conserved function. We focused our analysis on gene candidates that may be involved in remobilizing resources during flowering, grain filling and in allocating carbon towards roots colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and Rhizobia. Our findings open new perspectives for agroecological applications in legume crops, as for instance improving the yield and quality of seed productions and promoting the use of symbiotic microorganisms.

Although its pathophysiology is largely unknown, immune-inflammatory pathways may be involved. We examined serum interleukin (IL)-6, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), CXCL-8, and IL-10 in 67 female FM patients and 35 healthy women while adjusting for age, body mass index (BMI), and comorbid disorders. We scored the Fibromyalgia Severity Score, Widespread Pain Index (WPI), Symptom Severity Scale (SSS), Hospital Anxiety (HADS-A), and Depression Scale and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). Clinical rating scales were significantly higher in FM patients than in controls. After adjusting for covariates, IL-6, IL-10, and CXCL-8 were lower in FM than in HC, whereas hs-CRP did not show any difference. Binary regression analyses showed that the diagnosis FM was associated with lowered IL-10, quality of sleep, aerobic activities, and increased HADS-A and comorbidities. Neural networks showed that WPI was best predicted by quality of sleep, PSS-10, HADS-A, and the cytokines, while SSS was best predicted by PSS-10, HADS-A, and IL-10. Lowered levels of cytokines are associated with FM independently from confounders. Lowered IL-6 and IL-10 signaling may play a role in the pathophysiology of FM.

The major principles that define the architecture of antibody repertoires have remained largely unknown. Here, we establish a high-performance computing platform to construct large-scale networks from comprehensive human and murine antibody repertoire sequencing datasets (&gt;100,000 unique sequences). Leveraging a network-based statistical framework, we identify three fundamental principles of antibody repertoire architecture: reproducibility, robustness and redundancy. Antibody repertoire networks are highly reproducible across individuals despite high antibody sequence dissimilarity. The architecture of antibody repertoires is robust to the removal of up to 50-90% of randomly selected clones, but fragile to the removal of public clones shared among individuals. Finally, repertoire architecture is intrinsically redundant. Our analysis provides guidelines for the large-scale network analysis of immune repertoires and may be used in the future to define disease-associated and synthetic repertoires.

In this retrospective study, a total of 202 <sup>99m</sup>Tc-TRODAT-1 SPECT imaging were collected. All of the PD patient cases were separated into mild (HYS Stage 1 to Stage 3) and severe (HYS Stage 4 and Stage 5) PD, according to the Hoehn and Yahr Scale (HYS) standard. A three-dimensional method was used to estimate six features of activity distribution and striatal activity volume in the images. These features were skewness, kurtosis, Cyhelsky's skewness coefficient, Pearson's median skewness, dopamine transporter activity volume, and dopamine transporter activity maximum. Finally, the data were modeled using logistic regression (LR) and support vector machine (SVM) for PD classification. The results showed that SVM classifier method produced a higher accuracy than LR. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, accuracy, and AUC with SVM method were 0.82, 1.00, 0.84, 0.67, 0.83, and 0.85, respectively. Additionally, the Kappa value was shown to reach 0.68. This claimed that the SVM-based model could provide further reference for PD stage classification in medical diagnosis. In the future, more healthy cases will be expected to clarify the false positive rate in this classification model.

  Methods:  A DTI scan was performed in 77 patients and 67 normal controls. A fractional anisotropy map was generated by DTIFit. TBSS was used to find the region where the FA differed between the case and control groups. Each resulting FA value image is registered with each other to create an average FA value skeleton. Each resultant FA skeleton image was connected to feature vectors, and features with significant differences were extracted and classified using a support vector machine (SVM). Next, brain segmentation was performed on each subject's DTI image using automated anatomical labeling (AAL), and deterministic white matter fiber bundle tracking was performed to generate symmetrical brain matrix, select the upper triangular component as a classification feature. Two-sample t-test was used to extract the features with significant differences, then classified by SVM. Finally, we adopted a permutation test and ROC curves to evaluate the reliability of the classifier. 
  Results:  For FA, the accuracy of classification between the 0-6, 6-12 and &gt; 12 months post-RT groups and the control group was 84.5, 83.9 and 74.5%, respectively. In the case groups, the FA with discriminative ability was reduced, mainly in the bilateral cerebellum and bilateral temporal lobe, with prolonged time, the damage was aggravated. For WM connections, the SVM classifier classification recognition rates of the 0-6, 6-12 and &gt; 12 months post-RT groups reached 82.5, 78.4 and 76.3%, respectively. The WM connections with discriminative ability were reduced. 
  Conclusions:  RBI is a disease involving whole brain WM network anomalies. These brain discriminating WM regions and WM connection modes can supplement the understanding of RBI and be used as biomarkers for the early clinical diagnosis of RBI.

Around 2101 fatalities ensued and 68,451 houses were damaged by the earthquake. In light of this devastating event, a post-earthquake map is required to establish the first step in the evacuation and mitigation plan. In this study, remote sensing imagery from the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellites was used. Pre- and post-earthquake satellite images were classified using artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and processed using a decorrelation method to generate the post-earthquake damage map. The affected areas were compared to the field data, the percentage conformity between the ANN and SVM results was analyzed, and four post-earthquake damage maps were generated. Based on the conformity analysis, the Landsat-8 imagery (85.83%) was superior to that of Sentinel-2 (63.88%). The resulting post-earthquake damage map can be used to assess the distribution of seismic damage following the Palu earthquake and may be used to mitigate damage in the event of future earthquakes.

At the same time, the traditional form of backpropagation is biologically implausible. In the present paper we propose an unusual learning rule, which has a degree of biological plausibility and which is motivated by Hebb's idea that change of the synapse strength should be local-i.e., should depend only on the activities of the pre- and postsynaptic neurons. We design a learning algorithm that utilizes global inhibition in the hidden layer and is capable of learning early feature detectors in a completely unsupervised way. These learned lower-layer feature detectors can be used to train higher-layer weights in a usual supervised way so that the performance of the full network is comparable to the performance of standard feedforward networks trained end-to-end with a backpropagation algorithm on simple tasks.

Although SNNs have been used to solve a variety of control tasks using the Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) learning rule, existing solutions usually involve hard-coded network architectures solving specific tasks rather than solving different kinds of tasks generally. This results in neglecting one of the biggest advantages of ANNs, i.e., being general-purpose and easy-to-use due to their simple network architecture, which usually consists of an input layer, one or multiple hidden layers and an output layer. This paper addresses the problem by introducing an end-to-end learning approach of spiking neural networks constructed with one hidden layer and reward-modulated Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (R-STDP) synapses in an all-to-all fashion. We use the supervised reward-modulated Spike-Timing-Dependent-Plasticity learning rule to train two different SNN-based sub-controllers to replicate a desired obstacle avoiding and goal approaching behavior, provided by pre-generated datasets. Together they make up a target-reaching controller, which is used to control a simulated mobile robot to reach a target area while avoiding obstacles in its path. We demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of our trained SNNs to achieve target reaching tasks in different unknown scenarios.

This article has two objectives. First, it clarifies which aspects of English Law are relevant in order to regulate the use of ML in clinical research on psychosis prediction. It is argued that its lawful implementation will depend upon the legal requirements regarding the balance between potential harms and benefits, particularly with reference to: (i) any additional risks introduced by the use of ML for data analysis and outcome prediction; and (ii) the inclusion of vulnerable research populations such as minors or incapacitated adults. Second, this article investigates how clinical prediction via ML might affect the practice of risk assessment under mental health legislation, with reference to English Law. It is argued that there is a potential for virtuous applications of clinical prediction in psychiatry. However, reaffirming the distinction between psychosis risk and risk of harm is paramount. Establishing psychosis risk and assessing a person's risk of harm are discrete practices, and so should remain when using artificial intelligence for psychiatric assessment. Evaluating whether clinical prediction via ML might benefit individuals with psychosis will depend on which risk we try to assess and on what we try to predict, whether this is psychosis transition, a psychotic relapse, self-harm and suicidality, or harm to others.

10.1109/TBCAS.2019.2955641  |  Robotics  |  Robotics  |  CNN  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   This paper presents a real-time fine gesture recognition system for multi-articulating hand prosthesis control, using an embedded convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify hand-muscle contractions sensed at the forearm. The sensor consists in a custom non-intrusive, compact, and easy-to-install 32-channel high-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) electrode array, built on a flexible printed circuit board (PCB) to allow wrapping around the forearm. The sensor provides a low-noise digitization interface with wireless data transmission through an industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) radio link. An original frequency-time-space cross-domain preprocessing method is proposed to enhance gesture-specific data homogeneity and generate reliable muscle activation maps, leading to 98.15% accuracy when using a majority vote over 5 subsequent inferences by the proposed CNN. The obtained real-time gesture recognition, within 100 to 200 ms, and CNN properties show reliable and promising results to improve on the state-of-the-art of commercial hand prostheses. Moreover, edge computing using a specialized embedded artificial intelligence (AI) platform ensures reliable, secure and low latency real-time operation as well as quick and easy access to training, fine-tuning and calibration of the neural network. Co-design of the signal processing, AI algorithms and sensing hardware ensures a reliable and power-efficient embedded gesture recognition system.

10.1007/s10916-019-1469-0  |  Prognosis  |  Diagnosis  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Existing early detection methods that deal with the pre-diagnosis of dementia have been criticised as not being comprehensive as they do not measure certain cognitive functioning domains besides being inaccessible. A more realistic approach is to develop a comprehensive outcome that includes cognitive functioning of dementia, as this will offer a robust and unbiased outcome for an individual. In this research, a mobile screening application for dementia traits called DementiaTest is proposed, which adopts the gold standard assessment criteria of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). DementiaTest is implemented and tested on the Android and IOS stores. More importantly, it collects data from cases and controls using an easy, interactive, and accessible platform. It provides patients and their family with quick pre-diagnostic reports using certain cognitive functioning indicators; these can be utilized by general practitioners (GPs) for referrals for further assessment in cases of positive outcomes. The data gathered using the new application can be analysed using Artificial Intelligence methods to evaluate the performance of the screening to pinpoint early signs of the dementia.

10.1109/EMBC.2019.8857448  |  Smart Healthcare  |  Diagnosis, Smart Healthcare  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Placental assessment through routine obstetrical ultrasound is often limited to documenting its location and ruling out placenta previa. However, many obstetrical complications originate from abnormal focal or global placental development. Technical difficulties in assessing the placenta as well as a lack of established objective criteria to classify echotexture are barriers to diagnosis of pathology by ultrasound imaging. As a first step towards the development of a computer aided placental assessment tool, we developed a fully automated method for placental segmentation using a convolutional neural network. The network contains a novel layer weighted by automated acoustic shadow detection to recognize artifacts specific to ultrasound. In order to develop a detection algorithm usable in different imaging scenarios, we acquired a dataset containing 1364 fetal ultrasound images from 247 patients acquired over 47 months was taken with different machines, operators, and at a range of gestational ages. Mean Dice coefficients for automated segmentation on the full dataset with and without the acoustic shadow detection layer were 0.92±0.04 and 0.91±0.03 when comparing to manual segmentation. Mean Dice coefficients on the subset of images containing acoustic shadows with and without acoustic shadow detection were 0.87±0.04 and 0.75±0.05. The method requires no user input to tune the detection. The automated placenta segmentation method can serve as a preprocessing step for further image analysis in artificial intelligence methods requiring large scale data processing of placental images.

Breeding 4.0 has been considered the next era of plant breeding. It is clear that the Breeding 4.0 era for maize will feature the integration of multi-disciplinary technologies including genomics and phenomics, gene editing and synthetic biology, and Big Data and artificial intelligence. The breeding approach of passively selecting ideal genotypes from designated genetic pools must soon evolve to virtual design of optimized genomes by pyramiding superior alleles using computational simulation. An optimized genome expressing optimal phenotypes, which may never actually be created, can function as a blueprint for breeding programs to use minimal materials and hybridizations to achieve maximum genetic gain. We propose a new breeding pipeline, "genomic design breeding," that incorporates doubled haploid production, genomic selection, and genome optimization and is facilitated by different scales of trait predictions and decision-making models. Successful implementation of the proposed model will facilitate the evolution of maize breeding from "art" to "science" and eventually to "intelligence," in the Breeding 4.0 era.

Firstly, the heterogeneous two-time-scale MASs are modeled by singular perturbation system with a singular perturbation parameter, which distinguishes fast and slow subsystems evolving on two different time scales. Due to the ill-posedness problems caused by the singular perturbation parameter, we analyze the two-time-scale MASs via the singular perturbation method, instead of the general methods. Then, we split the heterogeneous two-time-scale MASs into slow and fast subsystems to eliminate the singular perturbation parameter. Subsequently, according to the matrix theory and the graph theory, we propose some necessary/sufficient criteria for the controllability of the heterogeneous two-time-scale MASs. Lastly, we give some simulation and numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.

However, we need new ideas and application contexts for integration of biomarkers and emerging technologies in modern pharmacovigilance. A new concept, panvigilance, has been recently introduced for proactive "stress testing" of new drug candidates in panels of patients or healthy volunteers identified by biomarkers, and who are situated in population edges in terms of pharmacokinetic (PK) and/or molecular target interindividual variability. Panvigilance aims to provide upper and lower bound estimates for drug performance under conditions that mimic population edges. Subsequently, it becomes easier to extrapolate pharmacovigilance signals with regard to individuals who reside in between the population edges. In this expert review, we explain that the prefix "pan," meaning everything or all, refers to the three-pronged panvigilance goals to (1) decipher the full population scale variability in medicinal product PKs and molecular target variability, (2) empower forecasting of pharmacovigilance signals within and across populations through knowledge of biomarker variations worldwide, and (3) integration of pharmacovigilance signals across government ministries, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders through, for example, institutional innovation such as centers for panvigilance. We note that panvigilance and pharmacovigilance are complementary, and underscore the added value of panvigilance for global clinical trials. Panvigilance offers a new opportunity for meaningful biomarker application in clinical trials beyond traditional contexts such as personalized medicine. In sum, panvigilance is a systems approach to pharmacovigilance and poised to innovate risk governance in medicinal product development and clinical trials.

10.3389/fnbot.2019.00078  |  Robotics  |  Robotics  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Modern engineering problems require solutions with multiple functionalities in order to meet their practical needs to handle a variety of applications in different scenarios. Conventional design paradigms for single design purpose may not be able to satisfy this requirement efficiently. This paper proposes a novel system-of-systems bio-inspired design method framed in a solution-driven bio-inspired design paradigm. The whole design process consists of eight steps, that is, (1) biological solutions identification, (2) biological solutions definition/champion biological solutions, (3) principle extraction from each champion biological solution, (4) merging of extracted principles, (5) solution reframing, (6) problem search, (7) problem definition, and (8) principles application &amp; implementation. The steps are elaborated and a case study of reconfigurable robots is presented following these eight steps. The design originates from the multimodal locomotion capabilities of two species (i.e., spiders and primates) and is analyzed based on the Pugh analysis. The resulting robotic platform could be potentially used for urban patrolling purposes.

10.5946/ce.2019.012  |  Prognosis  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Colorectal tumors with superficial submucosal invasion, which cannot be removed by snaring, are one of the most optimal indications for colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). Therefore, estimation of the invasion depth is the first key to successful colorectal ESD. Although estimation of the invasion depth based on the gross morphology may be useful in selected cases, its diagnostic accuracy could not reach the clinical requirement. The Japan Narrow-band Imaging (NBI) Expert Team (JNET) classification of NBI magnifying endoscopy findings is a useful method for histologic prediction and invasion depth estimation. However, magnifying chromoendoscopy is still necessary for JNET type 2B lesions to reach a satisfactory diagnostic accuracy. Endocytoscopy with artificial intelligence is a promising technology in invasion depth estimation; however, more data are needed for its clinical application.

Early detection and treatment can reduce the rate of blindness in cataract patients. However, the professional knowledge of ophthalmologists is necessary for the clinical cataract detection. Therefore, the potential costs may make it difficult for the widespread use of cataract detection to prevent blindness. Artificial intelligence assisted diagnosis based on medical images has attracted more and more attention of researchers. Many studies have focused on the use of pre-defined feature sets for cataract classification, but the predefined feature sets may be incomplete or redundant. On account of the aforementioned issues, some studies have proposed deep learning methods to automatically extract image features, but all based on global features and none has analyzed the layer-by-layer transformation process of the middle-tier features. This paper uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) to learn useful features directly from input data, and deconvolution network method is employed to investigate how CNN characterizes cataract layer-by-layer. We found that compared to the global feature set, the detail vascular information, which is lost after multi-layer convolution calculation also plays an important role in cataract grading task. And this finding fits with the morphological definition of fundus image. Through the finding, we gained insights into the design of hybrid global-local feature representation model to improve the recognition performance of automatic cataract grading.

From birth, humans are conditioned to perceive, interpret, and react to information conveyed by faces both familiar and unfamiliar. Although face recognition is routine for humans, only recently has it become possible for a computer to accurately recognize a human face in an image or video. With advances in artificial intelligence, image capture technology, and Internet connectivity, facial recognition technology has entered the forefront of personal and commercial technology. Plastic surgeons should be prepared to answer questions from patients about the fundamentals of facial recognition technology, and the potential effects of plastic surgery on facial recognition technology performance. This article provides an overview of facial recognition technology, describes its present applications, discusses its relevance within the field of plastic surgery, and provides recommendations for plastic surgeons to consider during preoperative discussions with patients.

Color images of four types of burn depth injured in first few days, including normal skin and background, acquired by a TiVi camera were trained and tested with four pretrained deep CNNs: VGG-16, GoogleNet, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101. In the end, the best 10-fold cross-validation results obtained from ResNet-101 with an average, minimum, and maximum accuracy are 81.66, 72.06, and 88.06%, respectively; and the average accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for the four different types of burn depth are 90.54, 74.35, and 94.25%, respectively. The accuracy was compared with the clinical diagnosis obtained after the wound had healed. Hence, application of AI is very promising for prediction of burn depth and, therefore, can be a useful tool to help in guiding clinical decision and initial treatment of burn wounds.

10.1103/PhysRevE.99.043306  |  None  |  None, Other  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   A wide variety of optimization techniques, both exact and heuristic, tend to be biased samplers. This means that when attempting to find multiple uncorrelated solutions of a degenerate Boolean optimization problem a subset of the solution space tends to be favored while, in the worst case, some solutions can never be accessed by the algorithm used. Here we present a simple postprocessing technique that improves sampling for any optimization approach, either quantum or classical. More precisely, starting from a pool of a few optimal configurations, the algorithm generates potentially new solutions via rejection-free cluster updates at zero temperature. Although the method is not ergodic and there is no guarantee that all the solutions can be found, fair sampling is typically improved. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method by improving the exponentially biased data produced by the D-Wave 2X quantum annealer [S. Mandrà et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 070502 (2017)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.118.070502], as well as data from three-dimensional Ising spin glasses. As part of the study, we also show that sampling is improved when suboptimal states are included and discuss sampling at a finite fixed temperature.

This paper introduces an intelligent prediction and classification system for healthcare, namely Density based Feature Selection (DFS) with Ant Colony based Optimization (D-ACO) algorithm for chronic kidney disease (CKD). The proposed intelligent system eliminates irrelevant or redundant features by DFS in prior to the ACO based classifier construction. The proposed D-ACO framework three phases namely preprocessing, Feature Selection (FS) and classification. Furthermore, the D-ACO algorithm is tested using benchmark CKD dataset and the performance are investigated based on different evaluation factors. Comparing the D-ACO algorithm with existing methods, the presented intelligent system outperformed the other methodologies with a significant improvisation in classification accuracy using fewer features.

Few studies have examined clinicopathologic correlations between phosphorylated-tau neurofibrillary tangles, β-amyloid neuritic plaques, neuroinflammation, or white matter (WM) lesions, and neuropsychiatric disorders in veterans. We describe clinicopathologic findings in 4 military veterans with early-onset dementia (EOD) who had varying histories of blunt- and blast-TBI, cognitive decline, behavioral abnormalities, post-traumatic stress disorder, suicidal ideation, and suicide. We found that pathologic lesions in these military-EOD cases could not be categorized as classic Alzheimer's disease (AD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy, traumatic axonal injury, or other well-characterized clinicopathologic entities. Rather, we observed a mixture of polypathology with unusual patterns compared with pathologies found in AD or other dementias. Also, ultrahigh resolution ex vivo MRI in 2 of these 4 brains revealed unusual patterns of periventricular WM injury. These findings suggest that military-EOD cases are associated with atypical combinations of brain lesions and distribution rarely seen in nonmilitary populations. Future prospective studies that acquire neuropsychiatric data before and after deployments, as well as genetic and environmental exposure data, are needed to further elucidate clinicopathologic correlations in military-EOD.

It is desirable to develop automatic and accurate detection of COVID-19 using chest CT. Purpose To develop a fully automatic framework to detect COVID-19 using chest CT and evaluate its performances. Materials and Methods In this retrospective and multi-center study, a deep learning model, COVID-19 detection neural network (COVNet), was developed to extract visual features from volumetric chest CT exams for the detection of COVID-19. Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and other non-pneumonia CT exams were included to test the robustness of the model. The datasets were collected from 6 hospitals between August 2016 and February 2020. Diagnostic performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity. Results The collected dataset consisted of 4356 chest CT exams from 3,322 patients. The average age is 49±15 years and there were slightly more male patients than female (1838 vs 1484; p-value=0.29). The per-exam sensitivity and specificity for detecting COVID-19 in the independent test set was 114 of 127 (90% [95% CI: 83%, 94%]) and 294 of 307 (96% [95% CI: 93%, 98%]), respectively, with an AUC of 0.96 (p-value&lt;0.001). The per-exam sensitivity and specificity for detecting CAP in the independent test set was 87% (152 of 175) and 92% (239 of 259), respectively, with an AUC of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.97). Conclusions A deep learning model can accurately detect COVID-19 and differentiate it from community acquired pneumonia and other lung diseases.

10.1016/j.mri.2019.09.006  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis  |  Strategically acquired gradient echo  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   One major thrust in radiology today is image standardization with a focus on rapidly acquired quantitative multi-contrast information. This is critical for multi-center trials, for the collection of big data and for the use of artificial intelligence in evaluating the data. Strategically acquired gradient echo (STAGE) imaging is one such method that can provide 8 qualitative and 7 quantitative pieces of information in 5 min or less at 3 T. STAGE provides qualitative images in the form of proton density weighted images, T1 weighted images, T2* weighted images and simulated double inversion recovery (DIR) images. STAGE also provides quantitative data in the form of proton spin density, T1, T2* and susceptibility maps as well as segmentation of white matter, gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid. STAGE uses vendors' product gradient echo sequences. It can be applied from 0.35 T to 7 T across all manufacturers producing similar results in contrast and quantification of the data. In this paper, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of STAGE, demonstrate its contrast-to-noise (CNR) behavior relative to a large clinical data set and introduce a few new image contrasts derived from STAGE, including DIR images and a new concept referred to as true susceptibility weighted imaging (tSWI) linked to fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) or tSWI-FLAIR for the evaluation of multiple sclerosis lesions. The robustness of STAGE T1 mapping was tested using the NIST/NIH phantom, while the reproducibility was tested by scanning a given individual ten times in one session and the same subject scanned once a week over a 12-week period. Assessment of the CNR for the enhanced T1W image (T1WE) showed a significantly better contrast between gray matter and white matter than conventional T1W images in both patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls. We also present some clinical cases using STAGE imaging in patients with stroke, metastasis, multiple sclerosis and a fetus with ventriculomegaly. Overall, STAGE is a comprehensive protocol that provides the clinician with numerous qualitative and quantitative images.

10.1007/s12149-020-01460-z  |  Treatment, Prognosis, Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Treatment  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Objective:  The aim of the study was to investigate the outcomes and prognostic factors of high-dose <sup>131</sup>I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (<sup>131</sup>I-MIBG) therapy in patients with refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma (NBL) in Japan. 
  Methods:  We retrospectively analyzed 20 patients with refractory or relapsed high-risk NBL who underwent <sup>131</sup>I-MIBG therapy with an administration dose ranging from 444 to 666 MBq/kg at Kanazawa University Hospital, Japan, between September 2008 and September 2013. We focused on measurements regarding their initial responses, prognostic factors, survivals, and toxicities following <sup>131</sup>I-MIBG therapy using our hospital data and questionnaires from the hospitals that these patients were initially referred from. Furthermore, we performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to evaluate event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). 
  Results:  In 19 patients with complete follow-up data, the median age at first <sup>131</sup>I-MIBG treatment was 7.9 years (range 2.5-17.7 years). Following <sup>131</sup>I-MIBG therapy, 17 of the 19 patients underwent stem-cell transplantations, and their treatment response was either complete (CR) or partial (PR) in three and two cases, respectively. The EFS and OS rates at 1 year following <sup>131</sup>I-MIBG therapy were 42% and 58%, respectively, and those at 5 years following <sup>131</sup>I-MIBG therapy were 16% and 42%, respectively. Using the two-sample log-rank test, the OS time following <sup>131</sup>I-MIBG therapy was significantly longer for &lt; 3-year time interval between the initial diagnosis and <sup>131</sup>I-MIBG therapy (p = 0.017), Curie score &lt; 16 just before <sup>131</sup>I-MIBG therapy (p = 0.002), without pain (p = 0.002), without both vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) elevation (p = 0.037) at <sup>131</sup>I-MIBG therapy, and with CR or PR following <sup>131</sup>I-MIBG therapy (p = 0.015). Although severe hematological toxicities were identified in all 19 patients, severe nonhematological toxicity was not recorded in any patient, except for one patient with grade 3 anorexia and nausea. 
  Conclusions:  High-dose <sup>131</sup>I-MIBG therapy in patients with refractory or relapsed high-risk NBL can provide a favorable prognosis without severe nonhematological toxicities. Better prognosis may be anticipated in patients with the initial good response, no pain at <sup>131</sup>I-MIBG therapy, no VMA and HVA elevation at <sup>131</sup>I-MIBG therapy, low Curie score (&lt; 16) just before <sup>131</sup>I-MIBG therapy, and short time interval (&lt; 3 years) between the initial diagnosis and <sup>131</sup>I-MIBG therapy.

10.1007/s12350-018-1317-5  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Coronary PET shows promise in the detection of high-risk atherosclerosis, but there remains a need to optimize imaging and reconstruction techniques. We investigated the impact of reconstruction parameters and cardiac motion-correction in <sup>18</sup>F Sodium Fluoride (<sup>18</sup>F-NaF) PET. 
  Methods:  Twenty-two patients underwent <sup>18</sup>F-NaF PET within 22 days of an acute coronary syndrome. Optimal reconstruction parameters were determined in a subgroup of six patients. Motion-correction was performed on ECG-gated data of all patients with optimal reconstruction. Tracer uptake was quantified in culprit and reference lesions by computing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in diastolic, summed, and motion-corrected images. 
  Results:  Reconstruction using 24 subsets, 4 iterations, point-spread-function modelling, time of flight, and 5-mm post-filtering provided the highest median SNR (31.5) compared to 4 iterations 0-mm (22.5), 8 iterations 0-mm (21.1), and 8 iterations 5-mm (25.6; all P &lt; .05). Motion-correction improved SNR of culprit lesions (n = 33) (24.5[19.9-31.5]) compared to diastolic (15.7[12.4-18.1]; P &lt; .001) and summed data (22.1[18.9-29.2]; P &lt; .001). Motion-correction increased the SNR difference between culprit and reference lesions (10.9[6.3-12.6]) compared to diastolic (6.2[3.6-10.3]; P = .001) and summed data (7.1 [4.8-11.6]; P = .001). 
  Conclusions:  The number of iterations and extent of post-filtering has marked effects on coronary <sup>18</sup>F-NaF PET quantification. Cardiac motion-correction improves discrimination between culprit and reference lesions.

The goal of the current review was to provide an overview of the current clinical, regulatory, technological, and analytic landscape as it relates to PGHD in oncology research and care. The review begins with a rationale for PGHD as described by the US Food and Drug Administration, the Institute of Medicine, and other regulatory and scientific organizations. The evidence base for clinic-based and remote symptom monitoring using PGHD is described, with an emphasis on PROs. An overview is presented of current approaches to digital phenotyping or device-based, real-time assessment of biometric, behavioral, self-report, and performance data. Analytic opportunities regarding PGHD are envisioned in the context of big data and artificial intelligence in medicine. Finally, challenges and solutions for the integration of PGHD into clinical care are presented. The challenges include electronic medical record integration of PROs and biometric data, analysis of large and complex biometric data sets, and potential clinic workflow redesign. In addition, there is currently more limited evidence for the use of biometric data relative to PROs. Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of PGHD make them increasingly likely to be integrated into oncology research and clinical care.

10.1192/bjp.2019.127  |  Diagnosis, Genetics  |  Diagnosis, Genetics  |  Multimodal neuroimaging  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Schizophrenia is a complex mental disorder with high heritability and polygenic inheritance. Multimodal neuroimaging studies have also indicated that abnormalities of brain structure and function are a plausible neurobiological characterisation of schizophrenia. However, the polygenic effects of schizophrenia on these imaging endophenotypes have not yet been fully elucidated. 
  Aims:  To investigate the effects of polygenic risk for schizophrenia on the brain grey matter volume and functional connectivity, which are disrupted in schizophrenia. 
  Method:  Genomic and neuroimaging data from a large sample of Han Chinese patients with schizophrenia (N = 509) and healthy controls (N = 502) were included in this study. We examined grey matter volume and functional connectivity via structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging, respectively. Using the data from a recent meta-analysis of a genome-wide association study that comprised a large number of Chinese people, we calculated a polygenic risk score (PGRS) for each participant. 
  Results:  The imaging genetic analysis revealed that the individual PGRS showed a significantly negative correlation with the hippocampal grey matter volume and hippocampus-medial prefrontal cortex functional connectivity, both of which were lower in the people with schizophrenia than in the controls. We also found that the observed neuroimaging measures showed weak but similar changes in unaffected first-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia. 
  Conclusions:  These findings suggested that genetically influenced brain grey matter volume and functional connectivity may provide important clues for understanding the pathological mechanisms of schizophrenia and for the early diagnosis of schizophrenia.

10.1002/humu.23948  |  Genetics  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Primary microcephaly (PM) is characterized by a small head since birth and is vastly heterogeneous both genetically and phenotypically. While most cases are monogenic, genetic interactions between Aspm and Wdr62 have recently been described in a mouse model of PM. Here, we used two complementary, holistic in vivo approaches: high throughput DNA sequencing of multiple PM genes in human patients with PM, and genome-edited zebrafish modeling for the digenic inheritance of PM. Exomes of patients with PM showed a significant burden of variants in 75 PM genes, that persisted after removing monogenic causes of PM (e.g., biallelic pathogenic variants in CEP152). This observation was replicated in an independent cohort of patients with PM, where a PM gene panel showed in addition that the burden was carried by six centrosomal genes. Allelic frequencies were consistent with digenic inheritance. In zebrafish, non-centrosomal gene casc5 -/- produced a severe PM phenotype, that was not modified by centrosomal genes aspm or wdr62 invalidation. A digenic, quadriallelic PM phenotype was produced by aspm and wdr62. Our observations provide strong evidence for digenic inheritance of human PM, involving centrosomal genes. Absence of genetic interaction between casc5 and aspm or wdr62 further delineates centrosomal and non-centrosomal pathways in PM.

It is challenging to fabricate stimuli-responsive hydrogels showing simultaneous changes in fluorescence color, brightness, and shape in response to a single stimulus. Herein, a bilayer hydrogel strategy is designed by utilizing an aggregation-induced emission luminogen, tetra-(4-pyridylphenyl)ethylene (TPE-4Py), to fabricate hydrogels with the above capabilities. Bilayer hydrogel actuators with the ionomer of poly(acrylamide-r-sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PAS) as a matrix of both active and passive layers and TPE-4Py as the core function element in the active layer are prepared. At acidic pH, the protonation of TPE-4Py leads to fluorescence color and brightness changes of the actuators and the electrostatic interactions between the protonated TPE-4Py and benzenesulfonate groups of the PAS chains in the active layer cause the actuators to deform. The proposed TPE-4Py/PAS-based bilayer hydrogel actuators with such responsiveness to stimulus provide insights in the design of intelligent systems and are highly attractive material candidates in the fields of 3D/4D printing, soft robots, and smart wearable devices.

10.3390/ijerph17031093  |  Smart Healthcare  |  Prognosis, Smart Healthcare  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   <i>Background</i>: The primary care service in Catalonia has operated an asynchronous teleconsulting service between GPs and patients since 2015 (eConsulta), which has generated some 500,000 messages. New developments in big data analysis tools, particularly those involving natural language, can be used to accurately and systematically evaluate the impact of the service. <i>Objective</i>: The study was intended to assess the predictive potential of eConsulta messages through different combinations of vector representation of text and machine learning algorithms and to evaluate their performance. <i>Methodology</i>: Twenty machine learning algorithms (based on five types of algorithms and four text representation techniques) were trained using a sample of 3559 messages (169,102 words) corresponding to 2268 teleconsultations (1.57 messages per teleconsultation) in order to predict the three variables of interest (avoiding the need for a face-to-face visit, increased demand and type of use of the teleconsultation). The performance of the various combinations was measured in terms of precision, sensitivity, F-value and the ROC curve. <i>Results</i>: The best-trained algorithms are generally effective, proving themselves to be more robust when approximating the two binary variables "avoiding the need of a face-to-face visit" and "increased demand" (precision = 0.98 and 0.97, respectively) rather than the variable "type of query" (precision = 0.48). <i>Conclusion</i>: To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate a machine learning strategy for text classification using primary care teleconsultation datasets. The study illustrates the possible capacities of text analysis using artificial intelligence. The development of a robust text classification tool could be feasible by validating it with more data, making it potentially more useful for decision support for health professionals.

10.2196/15510  |  Smart Healthcare, Diagnosis, Prognosis, Treatment  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Treatment, Smart Healthcare  |  temporal-enhanced gradient boosting machine (GBM), Landmark-Boosting  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Artificial intelligence-enabled electronic health record (EHR) analysis can revolutionize medical practice from the diagnosis and prediction of complex diseases to making recommendations in patient care, especially for chronic conditions such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is one of the most frequent complications in patients with diabetes and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. 
  Objective:  The longitudinal prediction of health outcomes requires effective representation of temporal data in the EHR. In this study, we proposed a novel temporal-enhanced gradient boosting machine (GBM) model that dynamically updates and ensembles learners based on new events in patient timelines to improve the prediction accuracy of CKD among patients with diabetes. 
  Methods:  Using a broad spectrum of deidentified EHR data on a retrospective cohort of 14,039 adult patients with type 2 diabetes and GBM as the base learner, we validated our proposed Landmark-Boosting model against three state-of-the-art temporal models for rolling predictions of 1-year CKD risk. 
  Results:  The proposed model uniformly outperformed other models, achieving an area under receiver operating curve of 0.83 (95% CI 0.76-0.85), 0.78 (95% CI 0.75-0.82), and 0.82 (95% CI 0.78-0.86) in predicting CKD risk with automatic accumulation of new data in later years (years 2, 3, and 4 since diabetes mellitus onset, respectively). The Landmark-Boosting model also maintained the best calibration across moderate- and high-risk groups and over time. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed temporal model can not only accurately predict 1-year CKD risk but also improve performance over time with additionally accumulated data, which is essential for clinical use to improve renal management of patients with diabetes. 
  Conclusions:  Incorporation of temporal information in EHR data can significantly improve predictive model performance and will particularly benefit patients who follow-up with their physicians as recommended.

In this paper, we propose to accelerate these intensive neural computations using memristive neural networks in analog domain. The implementation of Analog Memristive Deep Convolutional GAN (AM-DCGAN) using Generator as deconvolutional and Discriminator as convolutional memristive neural network is presented. The system is simulated at circuit level with 1.7 million memristor devices taking into account memristor non-idealities, device and circuit parameters. The design is modular with crossbar arrays having a minimum average power consumption per neural computation of 47nW. The design exclusively uses the principles of neural network dropouts resulting in regularization and lowering the power consumption. The SPICE level simulation of GAN is performed with 0.18 μm CMOS technology and WO<sub>x</sub> memristive devices with R<sub>ON</sub> = 40 kΩ and R<sub>OFF</sub> = 250 kΩ, threshold voltage 0.8 V and write voltage at 1.0 V.

Handwritten digit classification using a single-layer artificial neural network (ANN) with a Softmin-based activation function is described as an implementation example. To realize time-mode operation, the presented design makes use of monostable multivibrator-based multiplying analogue-to-time converters, fixed-width pulse generators and basic digital gates. The time-mode digit classification ANN was designed in a standard CMOS 0.18 μm IC process and operates from a supply voltage of 0.6 V. The system operates on the MNIST database of handwritten digits with quantized neuron weights and has a classification accuracy of 88%, which is typical for single-layer ANNs, while dissipating 65.74 pJ per classification with a speed of 2.37 k classifications per second. This article is part of the theme issue 'Harmonizing energy-autonomous computing and intelligence'.

10.1002/hbm.24968  |  Other  |  None, Other  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   There is an ongoing debate about whether, and to what extent, males differ from females in their language skills. In the case of handwriting, a composite language skill involving language and motor processes, behavioral observations consistently show robust sex differences but the mechanisms underlying the effect are unclear. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a copying task, the present study examined the neural basis of sex differences in handwriting in 53 healthy adults (ages 19-28, 27 males). Compared to females, males showed increased activation in the left posterior middle frontal gyrus (Exner's area), a region thought to support the conversion between orthographic and graphomotor codes. Functional connectivity between Exner's area and the right cerebellum was greater in males than in females. Furthermore, sex differences in brain activity related to handwriting were independent of language material. This study identifies a novel neural signature of sex differences in a hallmark of human behavior, and highlights the importance of considering sex as a factor in scientific research and clinical applications involving handwriting.

10.1136/gutjnl-2019-318860  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Genetics  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Treatment, Genetics  |  SVM  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Objective:  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is difficult to diagnose at resectable stage. Recent studies have suggested that extracellular vesicles (EVs) contain long RNAs. The aim of this study was to develop a diagnostic (d-)signature for the detection of PDAC based on EV long RNA (exLR) profiling. 
  Design:  We conducted a case-control study with 501 participants, including 284 patients with PDAC, 100 patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) and 117 healthy subjects. The exLR profile of plasma samples was analysed by exLR sequencing. The d-signature was identified using a support vector machine algorithm and a training cohort (n=188) and was validated using an internal validation cohort (n=135) and an external validation cohort (n=178). 
  Results:  We developed a d-signature that comprised eight exLRs, including FGA, KRT19, HIST1H2BK, ITIH2, MARCH2, CLDN1, MAL2 and TIMP1, for PDAC detection. The d-signature showed high accuracy, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.960, 0.950 and 0.936 in the training, internal validation and external validation cohort, respectively. The d-signature was able to identify resectable stage I/II cancer with an AUC of 0.949 in the combined three cohorts. In addition, the d-signature showed superior performance to carbohydrate antigen 19-9 in distinguishing PDAC from CP (AUC 0.931 vs 0.873, p=0.028). 
  Conclusion:  This study is the first to characterise the plasma exLR profile in PDAC and to report an exLR signature for the detection of pancreatic cancer. This signature may improve the prognosis of patients who would have otherwise missed the curative treatment window.

10.1007/s11571-019-09560-x  |  Robotics, Treatment  |  Treatment, Robotics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Motor imagery (MI) is a mental representation of motor behavior and has been widely used in electroencephalogram based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of MI-based BCI-feedback training in post-stroke rehabilitation. However, in the earliest stage of the training, calibration data typically contain insufficient discriminability, resulting in unreliable feedback, which may decrease subjects' motivation and even hinder their training. To improve the performance in the early stages of MI training, a novel hybrid BCI paradigm based on MI and P300 is proposed in this study. In this paradigm, subjects are instructed to imagine writing the Chinese character following the flash order of the desired Chinese character displayed on the screen. The event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) phenomenon is produced with writing based on one's imagination. Simultaneously, the P300 potential is evoked by the flash of each stroke. Moreover, a fusion method of P300 and MI classification is proposed, in which unreliable P300 classifications are corrected by reliable MI classifications. Twelve healthy naïve MI subjects participated in this study. Results demonstrated that the proposed hybrid BCI paradigm yielded significantly better performance than the single-modality BCI paradigm. The recognition accuracy of the fusion method is significantly higher than that of P300 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and MI (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Moreover, the training data size can be reduced through fusion of these two modalities.

  Data sources:  Electronic databases: PubMed, Ovid Medline, Cochrane Library and Clinical Evidence (BMJ Publishing). 
  Review methods:  Articles on biomedical engineering, biotechnology, material science, mechanical and animal models in OM published between May 2015 and May 2019 were identified and subjected to review. A total of 132 articles were ultimately included. 
  Results:  New imaging technologies for the tympanic membrane (TM) and the middle ear cavity are being developed to assess TM thickness, identify biofilms and differentiate types of middle ear effusions. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied to train software programs to diagnose OM with a high degree of certainty. Genetically modified mice models for OM have further investigated what predisposes some individuals to OM and consequent hearing loss. New vaccine candidates protecting against major otopathogens are being explored and developed, especially combined vaccines, targeting more than one pathogen. Transcutaneous vaccination against non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae has been successfully tried in a chinchilla model. In terms of treatment, novel technologies for trans-tympanic drug delivery are entering the clinical domain. Various growth factors and grafting materials aimed at improving healing of TM perforations show promising results in animal models. 
  Conclusion:  New technologies and AI applications to improve the diagnosis of OM have shown promise in pre-clinical models and are gradually entering the clinical domain. So are novel vaccines and drug delivery approaches that may allow local treatment of OM. 
  Implications for practice:  New diagnostic methods, potential vaccine candidates and the novel trans-tympanic drug delivery show promising results, but are not yet adapted to clinical use.

10.1016/j.msard.2020.102034  |  Robotics, Treatment  |  Treatment, Robotics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Review  |    Background:  Multiple sclerosis is a progressive disease responsible for gait disabilities and cognitive impairment, which affect functional performance. Robot-assisted gait training is an emerging training method to facilitate body-weight-supported treadmill training in many neurologic diseases. Through this study, we aimed to determine the efficacy of robot-assisted gait training in patients with multiple sclerosis. 
  Methods:  We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of robot-assisted gait training for multiple sclerosis. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov registry for articles published before May 2019. The primary outcome was walking performance (gait parameters, balance, and ambulation capability). The secondary outcomes were changes in perceived fatigue, severity of spasticity, global mobility, physical and mental quality of life, severity of pain, activities of daily living, and treatment acceptance. 
  Results:  We identified 10 studies (9 different trials) that included patients with multiple sclerosis undergoing robot-assisted gait training or conventional walk training. The meta-analysis showed comparable effectiveness between robot-assisted gait training and conventional walking therapy in walking performance, quality of life, pain, or activities of daily living. The robot-assisted gait training was even statistically superior to conventional walking therapy in improving perceived fatigue (pooled SMD: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.02-0.67), spasticity (pooled SMD: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.08-1.33, I² = 53%), and global mobility (borderline) after the intervention. 
  Conclusion:  Our results provide the most up-to-date evidence regarding the robot-assisted gait training on multiple sclerosis. In addition to the safety and good tolerance, its efficacy on multiple sclerosis is comparable to that of conventional walking training and is even superior in improving fatigue and spasticity.

  Objective:  To investigate the effect of an artificial intelligence smartphone coaching app to promote home monitoring and hypertension-related behaviors on systolic blood pressure level compared with a blood pressure tracking app. 
  Design, setting, and participants:  This was a 2-group, open, randomized clinical trial. Participants with uncontrolled hypertension were recruited in 2016 and 2017 and were followed up for 6 months. Data analysis was performed from April 2019 to December 2019. 
  Interventions:  Intervention group participants received a smartphone coaching app to promote home monitoring and behavioral changes associated with hypertension self-management plus a home blood pressure monitor. Control participants received a blood pressure tracking app plus a home blood pressure monitor. 
  Main outcomes and measures:  The primary study outcome was systolic blood pressure at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included self-reported antihypertensive medication adherence, home monitoring and self-management practices, measures of self-efficacy associated with blood pressure, weight, and self-reported health behaviors. 
  Results:  There were 333 participants randomized, and 297 completed the follow-up assessment. Among the participants who completed the study, the mean (SD) age was 58.9 (12.8) years, 182 (61.3%) were women, and 103 (34.7%) were black. Baseline mean (SD) systolic blood pressure was 140.6 (12.2) mm Hg among intervention participants and 141.8 (13.4) mm Hg among control participants. After 6 months, the corresponding mean (SD) systolic blood pressures were 132.3 (15.0) mm Hg and 135.0 (13.9) mm Hg, with a between-group adjusted difference of -2.0 mm Hg (95% CI, -4.9 mm Hg to 0.8 mm Hg; P = .16). At 6 months, self-confidence in controlling blood pressure was greater in the intervention group (0.36 point on a 5-point scale; 95% CI, 0.18 point to 0.54 point; P &lt; .001). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in other secondary outcomes. The adjusted difference in self-reported physical activity was 26.7 minutes per week (95% CI, -5.4 minutes per week to 58.8 minutes per week; P = .10). Subgroup analysis raised the possibility that intervention effects differed by age. 
  Conclusions and relevance:  Among individuals with uncontrolled hypertension, those randomized to a smartphone coaching app plus home monitor had similar systolic blood pressure compared with those who received a blood pressure tracking app plus home monitor. Given the direction of the difference in systolic blood pressure between groups and the possibility for differences in treatment effects across subgroups, future studies are warranted.

Muscle MRI suggests diagnosis based on the pattern of muscle fatty replacement. However, patterns overlap between different disorders and knowledge about disease-specific patterns is limited. Our aim was to develop a software-based tool that can recognize muscle MRI patterns and thus aid diagnosis of MDs. 
  Methods:  We collected 976 pelvic and lower limbs T1-weighted muscle MRIs from 10 different MDs. Fatty replacement was quantified using Mercuri score and files containing the numeric data were generated. Random forest supervised machine learning was applied to develop a model useful to identify the correct diagnosis. Two thousand different models were generated and the one with highest accuracy was selected. A new set of 20 MRIs was used to test the accuracy of the model, and the results were compared with diagnoses proposed by 4 specialists in the field. 
  Results:  A total of 976 lower limbs MRIs from 10 different MDs were used. The best model obtained had 95.7% accuracy, with 92.1% sensitivity and 99.4% specificity. When compared with experts on the field, the diagnostic accuracy of the model generated was significantly higher in a new set of 20 MRIs. 
  Conclusion:  Machine learning can help doctors in the diagnosis of muscle dystrophies by analyzing patterns of muscle fatty replacement in muscle MRI. This tool can be helpful in daily clinics and in the interpretation of the results of next-generation sequencing tests. 
  Classification of evidence:  This study provides Class II evidence that a muscle MRI-based artificial intelligence tool accurately diagnoses muscular dystrophies.

  Objectives:  To identify long-term trends in HIV-1 molecular epidemiology and antiretroviral drug resistance (ARV) among migrants followed up in Portugal Methods: 5177 patients were included between 2001 and 2017. Rega, Scuel, Comet, and jPHMM algorithms were used for subtyping. Transmitted drug resistance (TDR) and Acquired drug resistance (ADR) were defined as the presence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and as mutations of the IAS-USA 2015 algorithm, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed. 
  Results:  HIV-1 subtypes infecting migrants were consistent with the ones prevailing in their countries of origin. Over time, overall TDR significantly increased and specifically for Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTIs) and Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTIs). TDR was higher in patients from Mozambique. Country of origin Mozambique and subtype B were independently associated with TDR. Overall, ADR significantly decreased over time and specifically for NRTIs and Protease Inhibitors (PIs). Age, subtype B, and viral load were independently associated with ADR. 
  Conclusions:  HIV-1 molecular epidemiology in migrants suggests high levels of connectivity with their country of origin. The increasing levels of TDR in migrants could indicate an increase also in their countries of origin, where more efficient surveillance should occur.

10.1089/omi.2019.0220  |  Treatment, Diagnosis, Genetics, Drug Discovery  |  Diagnosis, Drug Discovery, Treatment, Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Precision/personalized medicine is a hot topic in health care. Often presented with the motto "the right drug, for the right patient, at the right dose, and the right time," precision medicine is a theory for rational therapeutics as well as practice to individualize health interventions (e.g., drugs, food, vaccines, medical devices, and exercise programs) using biomarkers. Yet, an alien visitor to planet Earth reading the contemporary textbooks on diagnostics might think precision medicine requires only two biomolecules omnipresent in the literature: nucleic acids (e.g., DNA) and proteins, known as the first and second alphabet of biology, respectively. However, the precision/personalized medicine community has tended to underappreciate the third alphabet of life, the "sugar code" (i.e., the information stored in glycans, glycoproteins, and glycolipids). This article brings together experts in precision/personalized medicine science, pharmacoglycomics, emerging technology governance, cultural studies, contemporary art, and responsible innovation to critically comment on the sociomateriality of the three alphabets of life together. First, the current transformation of targeted therapies with personalized glycomedicine and glycan biomarkers is examined. Next, we discuss the reasons as to why unraveling of the sugar code might have lagged behind the DNA and protein codes. While social scientists have historically noted the importance of constructivism (e.g., how people interpret technology and build their values, hopes, and expectations into emerging technologies), life scientists relied on the material properties of technologies in explaining why some innovations emerge rapidly and are more popular than others. The concept of sociomateriality integrates these two explanations by highlighting the inherent entanglement of the social and the material contributions to knowledge and what is presented to us as reality from everyday laboratory life. Hence, we present a hypothesis based on a sociomaterial conceptual lens: because materiality and synthesis of glycans are not directly driven by a template, and thus more complex and open ended than sequencing of a finite length genome, social construction of expectations from unraveling of the sugar code versus the DNA code might have evolved differently, as being future-uncertain versus future-proof, respectively, thus potentially explaining the "sugar lag" in precision/personalized medicine diagnostics over the past decades. We conclude by introducing systems scientists, physicians, and biotechnology industry to the concept, practice, and value of responsible innovation, while glycomedicine and other emerging biomarker technologies (e.g., metagenomics and pharmacomicrobiomics) transition to applications in health care, ecology, pharmaceutical/diagnostic industries, agriculture, food, and bioengineering, among others.

10.1016/j.annonc.2020.04.003  |  Diagnosis, Treatment  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Treatment  |  deep learning radiomic nomogram  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Preoperative evaluation of the number of lymph node metastasis (LNM) is the basis of individual treatment of locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC). However, the routinely used preoperative determination method is not accurate enough. 
  Patients and methods:  We enrolled 730 LAGC patients from 5 centers in China and 1 center in Italy, and divided them into 1 primary cohort, 3 external validation cohorts, and 1 international validation cohort. A deep learning radiomic nomogram (DLRN) was built based on the images from multi-phase computed tomography (CT) for preoperatively determining the number of LNM in LAGC. We comprehensively tested the DLRN and compared it with three state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we investigated the value of the DLRN in survival analysis. 
  Results:  The DLRN showed good discrimination of the number of LNM on all cohorts (overall C-indexes: 0.821, 95% CI: 0.785-0.858 in the primary cohort; 0.797, 95% CI: 0.771-0.823 in the external validation cohorts; and 0.822, 95% CI: 0.756-0.887 in the international validation cohort). The nomogram performed significantly better than the routinely used clinical N stages, tumor size, and clinical model (p&lt;0.05). Besides, DLRN is significantly associated with the overall survival of LAGC patients (n=271). 
  Conclusion:  A deep learning-based radiomic nomogram had good predictive value for LNM in LAGC. In staging-oriented treatment of gastric cancer, this preoperative nomogram could provide baseline information for individual treatment of LAGC.

However, the current knowledge on the mutation spectra is limited, and the effects of radiation exposure on germ cells at stages other than the sperm stage remain unknown. Here, we performed whole-genome sequencing experiments to investigate the exposure of spermatogonia and mature oocytes. We compared de novo mutations in a total of 24 F1 mice conceived before and after the irradiation of their parents. The results indicated that radiation exposure, 4 Gy of gamma rays, induced 9.6 indels and 2.5 multisite mutations in spermatogonia and 4.7 indels and 3.1 multisite mutations in mature oocytes in the autosomal regions of each F1 individual. Notably, we found two types of deletions, namely, small deletions (mainly 1~12 nucleotides) in non-repeat sequences, many of which showed microhomology at the breakpoint junction, and single-nucleotide deletions in mononucleotide repeat sequences. The results suggest that these deletions and multisite mutations could be a typical signature of mutations induced by parental irradiation in mammals.

10.1371/journal.pone.0229819  |  Treatment, Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis, Treatment, Smart Healthcare  |  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel   |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   This large, retrospective case-control study of electronic health records from 56 million unique adult patients examined whether or not treatment with a Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) blocking agent is associated with lower risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, and other inflammatory diseases which are mediated in part by TNF and for which a TNF blocker is an approved treatment. The analysis compared the diagnosis of AD as an outcome measure in patients receiving at least one prescription for a TNF blocking agent (etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab) or for methotrexate. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) were estimated using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) method and presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p-values. RA was associated with a higher risk for AD (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 2.06, 95% Confidence Interval: (2.02-2.10), P-value &lt;0.0001) as did psoriasis (AOR = 1.37 (1.31-1.42), P &lt;0.0001), ankylosing spondylitis (AOR = 1.57 (1.39-1.77), P &lt;0.0001), inflammatory bowel disease (AOR = 2.46 (2.33-2.59), P &lt; 0.0001), ulcerative colitis (AOR = 1.82 (1.74-1.91), P &lt;0.0001), and Crohn's disease (AOR = 2.33 (2.22-2.43), P &lt;0.0001). The risk for AD in patients with RA was lower among patients treated with etanercept (AOR = 0.34 (0.25-0.47), P &lt;0.0001), adalimumab (AOR = 0.28 (0.19-0.39), P &lt; 0.0001), or infliximab (AOR = 0.52 (0.39-0.69), P &lt;0.0001). Methotrexate was also associated with a lower risk for AD (AOR = 0.64 (0.61-0.68), P &lt;0.0001), while lower risk was found in patients with a prescription history for both a TNF blocker and methotrexate. Etanercept and adalimumab also were associated with lower risk for AD in patients with psoriasis: AOR = 0.47 (0.30-0.73 and 0.41 (0.20-0.76), respectively. There was no effect of gender or race, while younger patients showed greater benefit from a TNF blocker than did older patients. This study identifies a subset of patients in whom systemic inflammation contributes to risk for AD through a pathological mechanism involving TNF and who therefore may benefit from treatment with a TNF blocking agent.

  Materials and methods:  The training set in this retrospective study consisted of 590 patients (460 with APE and 130 without APE) who underwent CTPA. A fully deep learning convolutional neural network (DL-CNN), called U-Net, was trained for the segmentation of clot. Additionally, an in-house validation set consisted of 288 patients (186 with APE and 102 without APE). In this study, we set different probability thresholds to test the performance of U-Net for the clot detection and selected sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) as the metrics of performance evaluation. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between the clot burden assessed by the Qanadli score, Mastora score, and other imaging parameters on CTPA and the clot burden calculated by the DL-CNN model. 
  Results:  There was no statistically significant difference in AUCs with the different probability thresholds. When the probability threshold for segmentation was 0.1, the sensitivity and specificity of U-Net in detecting clot respectively were 94.6% and 76.5% while the AUC was 0.926 (95% CI 0.884-0.968). Moreover, this study displayed that the clot burden measured with U-Net was significantly correlated with the Qanadli score (r = 0.819, p &lt; 0.001), Mastora score (r = 0.874, p &lt; 0.001), and right ventricular functional parameters on CTPA. 
  Conclusions:  DL-CNN achieved a high AUC for the detection of pulmonary emboli and can be applied to quantitatively calculate the clot burden of APE patients, which may contribute to reducing the workloads of clinicians. 
  Key points:  • Deep learning can detect APE with a good performance and efficiently calculate the clot burden to reduce the physicians' workload. • Clot burden measured with deep learning highly correlates with Qanadli and Mastora scores of CTPA. • Clot burden measured with deep learning correlates with parameters of right ventricular function on CTPA.

One of the main differences between the proposed architecture and other ones is the methodology of information acquisition regarding the robot's interlocutor. In order to obtain as much information as possible before the actual interaction took place, a custom Internet-of-Things-based sensor subsystems connected to Smart Infrastructure was designed and implemented, in order to support the interlocutor identification and acquisition of initial interaction parameters. The Artificial Intelligence interaction framework of the developed robotic system (including humanoid Pepper with its sensors and actuators, additional local, remote and cloud computing services) is being extended with the use of custom external subsystems for additional knowledge acquisition: device-based human identification, visual identification and audio-based interlocutor localization subsystems. These subsystems were deeply introduced and evaluated in this paper, presenting the benefits of integrating them into the robotic interaction system. In this paper a more detailed analysis of one of the external subsystems-Bluetooth Human Identification Smart Subsystem-was also included. The idea, use case, and a prototype, integration of elements of Smart Infrastructure systems and the prototype implementation were performed in a small front office of the Weegree company as a decent test-bed application area.

10.1007/s11571-019-09541-0  |  Treatment, Robotics  |  Robotics  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Many studies reported that ERP-based BCIs can provide communication for some people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ERP-based BCIs often present characters within a matrix that occupies the center of the visual field. However, several studies have identified some concerns with the matrix-based approach. This approach may lead to fatigue and errors resulting from flashing adjacent stimuli, and is impractical for users who might want to use the BCI in tandem with other software or feedback in the center of the monitor. In this paper, we introduce and validate an alternate ERP-based BCI display approach. By presenting stimuli near the periphery of the display, we reduce the adjacency problem and leave the center of the display available for feedback or other applications. Two ERP-based display approaches were tested on 18 ALS patients to: (1) compare performance between a conventional matrix speller paradigm (Matrix-P, mean visual angle 6°) and a new speller paradigm with peripherally distributed stimuli (Peripheral-P, mean visual angle 8.8°); and (2) assess performance while spelling 42 characters online continuously, without a break. In the Peripheral-P condition, 12 subjects attained higher than 80% feedback accuracy during online performance, and 7 of these subjects obtained higher than 90% accuracy. The experimental results showed that the Peripheral-P condition yielded performance comparable to the conventional Matrix-P condition (<i>p </i>&gt; 0.05) in accuracy and information transfer rate. This paper introduces a new display approach that leaves the center of the monitor open for feedback and/or other display elements, such as movies, games, art, or displays from other AAC software or conventional software tools.

Here, we tested whether kea (Nestor notabilis) can use relative quantities when predicting sampling outcomes, and then integrate both physical information about the presence of a barrier, and social information about the biased sampling of an experimenter, into their predictions. Our results show that kea exhibit three signatures of statistical inference, and therefore can integrate knowledge across different cognitive domains to flexibly adjust their predictions of sampling events. This result provides evidence that true statistical inference is found outside of the great apes, and that aspects of domain-general thinking can convergently evolve in brains with a highly different structure from primates. This has important implications not only for our understanding of how intelligence evolves, but also for research focused on how to create artificial domain-general thought processes.

The drug 5-fluorouracil is still used with a wide percentage of patients who do not respond. Therefore, a challenge is the identification of predictive biomarkers. The protein kinase R (PKR also called EIF2AK2) and its regulator, the non-coding pre-mir-nc886, have multiple effects on cells in response to numerous types of stress, including chemotherapy. In this work, we performed an ambispective study with 197 metastatic colon cancer patients with unresectable metastases to determine the relative expression levels of both nc886 and PKR by qPCR, as well as the location of PKR by immunohistochemistry in tumour samples and healthy tissues (plasma and colon epithelium). As primary end point, the expression levels were related to the objective response to first-line chemotherapy following the response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST) and, as the second end point, with survival at 18 and 36 months. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering was performed to accommodate the heterogeneity and complexity of oncological patients' data. High expression levels of nc886 were related to the response to treatment and allowed to identify clusters of patients. Although the PKR mRNA expression was not associated with chemotherapy response, the absence of PKR location in the nucleolus was correlated with first-line chemotherapy response. Moreover, a relationship between survival and the expression of both PKR and nc886 in healthy tissues was found. Therefore, this work evaluated the best way to analyse the potential biomarkers PKR and nc886 in order to establish clusters of patients depending on the cancer outcomes using algorithms for complex and heterogeneous data.

Centronuclear myopathy is a kind of disease difficult to diagnose due to its genetic diversity. Since the discovery of the SPEG gene and disease-causing variants, only a few additional patients have been reported. 
  Methods:  A radiograph test, ultrasonic test, and biochemical tests were applied to clinical diagnosis of CNM. We performed trio medical exome sequencing of the family and conservation analysis to identify variants. 
  Results:  We report a pair of severe CNM twins with the same novel homozygous SPEG variant c. 8710A&gt;G (p.Thr2904Ala) identified by clinical trio medical exome sequencing of the family and conservation analysis. The twins showed clinical symptoms of facial weakness, hypotonia, arthrogryposis, strephenopodia, patent ductus arteriosus, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
  Conclusions:  Our report expands the clinical and molecular repertoire of CNM and enriches the variant spectrum of the SPEG gene in the Chinese population and helps us further understand the pathogenesis of CNM.

After careful planning of exposure conditions and data preprocessing, the TGx data can be used in predictive toxicology, where more advanced modelling techniques are applied. The large volume of molecular profiles produced by omics-based technologies allows the development and application of artificial intelligence (AI) methods in TGx. Indeed, the publicly available omics datasets are constantly increasing together with a plethora of different methods that are made available to facilitate their analysis, interpretation and the generation of accurate and stable predictive models. In this review, we present the state-of-the-art of data modelling applied to transcriptomics data in TGx. We show how the benchmark dose (BMD) analysis can be applied to TGx data. We review read across and adverse outcome pathways (AOP) modelling methodologies. We discuss how network-based approaches can be successfully employed to clarify the mechanism of action (MOA) or specific biomarkers of exposure. We also describe the main AI methodologies applied to TGx data to create predictive classification and regression models and we address current challenges. Finally, we present a short description of deep learning (DL) and data integration methodologies applied in these contexts. Modelling of TGx data represents a valuable tool for more accurate chemical safety assessment. This review is the third part of a three-article series on Transcriptomics in Toxicogenomics.

The various multi-sensor signals are used to monitor the condition of the tool. In this work, the vibration signals and cutting force signals have been applied individually as well as in combination to determine their effectiveness for tool-condition monitoring applications. Moreover, they have been used to determine the best strategies for tool-condition monitoring by prediction of hole quality during micro-drilling operations with 0.4 mm micro-drills. Furthermore, this work also developed an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model using different time domains and wavelet packet features of these sensor signals for the prediction of the hole quality. The best prediction of hole quality was obtained by a combination of different sensor features in wavelet domain of vibration signal. The model's predicted results were found to exert a good agreement with the experimental results.

10.1111/ejn.14724  |  Genetics  |  Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Astrocytes are key players in the regulation of brain development and function. They sense and respond to the surrounding activity by elevating their intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup> ) levels. These astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations emerge from different sources and display complex spatio-temporal properties. Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations are spatially distributed in global (soma and main processes) and/or focal regions (microdomains). The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 2 knockout (IP<sub>3</sub> R2 KO) mouse model lacks global Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations in astrocytes, and it has been used by different laboratories. However, the constitutive deletion of IP<sub>3</sub> R2 during development may trigger compensating phenotypes, which could bias the results of experiments using developing or adult mice. To address this issue, we performed a detailed neurodevelopmental evaluation of male and female IP<sub>3</sub> R2 KO mice, during the first 21 days of life, as well as an evaluation of motor function, strength and neurological reflexes in adult mice. Our results show that male and female IP<sub>3</sub> R2 KO mice display a normal acquisition of developmental milestones, as compared with wild-type (WT) mice. We also show that IP<sub>3</sub> R2 KO mice display normal motor coordination, strength and neurological reflexes in adulthood. To exclude a potential compensatory overexpression of other IP<sub>3</sub> Rs, we quantified the relative mRNA levels of all 3 subtypes, in brain tissue. We found that, along with the complete deletion of Itpr2, there is no compensatory expression of Itpr1 or Itrp3. Overall, our results show that the IP<sub>3</sub> R2 KO mouse is a reliable model to study the functional impact of global IP<sub>3</sub> R2-dependent astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations.

10.1007/s11548-019-02057-2  |  Other  |  Diagnosis  |  finite element method  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Purpose:  Brain shift during tumor resection can progressively invalidate the accuracy of neuronavigation systems and affect neurosurgeons' ability to achieve optimal resections. This paper compares two methods that have been presented in the literature to compensate for brain shift: a thin-plate spline deformation model and a finite element method (FEM). For this comparison, both methods are driven by identical sparse data. Specifically, both methods are driven by displacements between automatically detected and matched feature points from intraoperative 3D ultrasound (iUS). Both methods have been shown to be fast enough for intraoperative brain shift correction (Machado et al. in Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg 13(10):1525-1538, 2018; Luo et al. in J Med Imaging (Bellingham) 4(3):035003, 2017). However, the spline method requires no preprocessing and ignores physical properties of the brain while the FEM method requires significant preprocessing and incorporates patient-specific physical and geometric constraints. The goal of this work was to explore the relative merits of these methods on recent clinical data. 
  Methods:  Data acquired during 19 sequential tumor resections in Brigham and Women's Hospital's Advanced Multi-modal Image-Guided Operating Suite between December 2017 and October 2018 were considered for this retrospective study. Of these, 15 cases and a total of 24 iUS to iUS image pairs met inclusion requirements. Automatic feature detection (Machado et al. in Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg 13(10):1525-1538, 2018) was used to detect and match features in each pair of iUS images. Displacements between matched features were then used to drive both the spline model and the FEM method to compensate for brain shift between image acquisitions. The accuracies of the resultant deformation models were measured by comparing the displacements of manually identified landmarks before and after deformation. 
  Results:  The mean initial subcortical registration error between preoperative MRI and the first iUS image averaged 5.3 ± 0.75 mm. The mean subcortical brain shift, measured using displacements between manually identified landmarks in pairs of iUS images, was 2.5 ± 1.3 mm. Our results showed that FEM was able to reduce subcortical registration error by a small but statistically significant amount (from 2.46 to 2.02 mm). A large variability in the results of the spline method prevented us from demonstrating either a statistically significant reduction in subcortical registration error after applying the spline method or a statistically significant difference between the results of the two methods. 
  Conclusions:  In this study, we observed less subcortical brain shift than has previously been reported in the literature (Frisken et al., in: Miller (ed) Biomechanics of the brain, Springer, Cham, 2019). This may be due to the fact that we separated out the initial misregistration between preoperative MRI and the first iUS image from our brain shift measurements or it may be due to modern neurosurgical practices designed to reduce brain shift, including reduced craniotomy sizes and better control of intracranial pressure with the use of mannitol and other medications. It appears that the FEM method and its use of geometric and biomechanical constraints provided more consistent brain shift correction and better correction farther from the driving feature displacements than the simple spline model. The spline-based method was simpler and tended to give better results for small deformations. However, large variability in the spline results and relatively small brain shift prevented this study from demonstrating a statistically significant difference between the results of the two methods.

We use data obtained from the orbiting Akatsuki spacecraft to investigate how the super-rotation is maintained in the cloud layer, where the rotation speed is highest. A thermally induced latitudinal-vertical circulation acts to homogenize the distribution of the angular momentum around the rotational axis. Maintaining the super-rotation requires this to be counteracted by atmospheric waves and turbulence. Among those effects, thermal tides transport the angular momentum, which maintains the rotation peak, near the cloud top at low latitudes. Other planetary-scale waves and large-scale turbulence act in the opposite direction. We suggest that hydrodynamic instabilities adjust the angular-momentum distribution at mid-latitudes.

10.1111/aas.13527  |  Prognosis  |  Prognosis  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Review  |    Background:  Mortality prediction models are applied in the intensive care unit (ICU) to stratify patients into different risk categories and to facilitate benchmarking. To ensure that the correct prediction models are applied for these purposes, the best performing models must be identified. As a first step, we aimed to establish a systematic review of mortality prediction models in critically ill patients. 
  Methods:  Mortality prediction models were searched in four databases using the following criteria: developed for use in adult ICU patients in high-income countries, with mortality as primary or secondary outcome. Characteristics and performance measures of the models were summarized. Performance was presented in terms of discrimination, calibration and overall performance measures presented in the original publication. 
  Results:  In total, 43 mortality prediction models were included in the final analysis. In all, 15 models were only internally validated (35%), 13 externally (30%) and 10 (23%) were both internally and externally validated by the original researchers. Discrimination was assessed in 42 models (98%). Commonly used calibration measures were the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (60%) and the calibration plot (28%). Calibration was not assessed in 11 models (26%). Overall performance was assessed in the Brier score (19%) and the Nagelkerke's R<sup>2</sup> (4.7%). 
  Conclusions:  Mortality prediction models have varying methodology, and validation and performance of individual models differ. External validation by the original researchers is often lacking and head-to-head comparisons are urgently needed to identify the best performing mortality prediction models for guiding clinical care and research in different settings and populations.

10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.2142  |  Treatment, Prognosis  |  Treatment  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Importance:  Studies have shown that adverse events are associated with increasing inpatient care expenditures, but contemporary data on the association between expenditures and adverse events beyond inpatient care are limited. 
  Objective:  To evaluate whether hospital-specific adverse event rates are associated with hospital-specific risk-standardized 30-day episode-of-care Medicare expenditures for fee-for-service patients discharged with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure (HF), or pneumonia. 
  Design, setting, and participants:  This cross-sectional study used the 2011 to 2016 hospital-specific risk-standardized 30-day episode-of-care expenditure data from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services and medical record-abstracted in-hospital adverse event data from the Medicare Patient Safety Monitoring System. The setting was acute care hospitals treating at least 25 Medicare fee-for-service patients for AMI, HF, or pneumonia in the United States. Participants were Medicare fee-for-service patients 65 years or older hospitalized for AMI, HF, or pneumonia included in the Medicare Patient Safety Monitoring System in 2011 to 2016. The dates of analysis were July 16, 2017, to May 21, 2018. 
  Main outcomes and measures:  Hospitals' risk-standardized 30-day episode-of-care expenditures and the rate of occurrence of adverse events for which patients were at risk. 
  Results:  The final study sample from 2194 unique hospitals included 44 807 patients (26.1% AMI, 35.6% HF, and 38.3% pneumonia) with a mean (SD) age of 79.4 (8.6) years, and 52.0% were women. The patients represented 84 766 exposures for AMI, 96 917 exposures for HF, and 109 641 exposures for pneumonia. Patient characteristics varied by condition but not by expenditure category. The mean (SD) risk-standardized expenditures were $22 985 ($1579) for AMI, $16 020 ($1416) for HF, and $16 355 ($1995) for pneumonia per hospitalization. The mean risk-standardized rates of occurrence of adverse events for which patients were at risk were 3.5% (95% CI, 3.4%-3.6%) for AMI, 2.5% (95% CI, 2.5%-2.5%) for HF, and 3.0% (95% CI, 2.9%-3.0%) for pneumonia. An increase by 1 percentage point in the rate of occurrence of adverse events was associated with an increase in risk-standardized expenditures of $103 (95% CI, $57-$150) for AMI, $100 (95% CI, $29-$172) for HF, and $152 (95% CI, $73-$232) for pneumonia per discharge. 
  Conclusions and relevance:  Hospitals with high adverse event rates were more likely to have high 30-day episode-of-care Medicare expenditures for patients discharged with AMI, HF, or pneumonia.

Detailed information about differences between PCiS and anterior circulation ischemic stroke (ACiS) remains scarce. Such information might guide clinical decision making and prevention strategies. We studied risk factors and ischemic stroke subtypes in PCiS vs. ACiS and lesion location on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in PCiS. 
  Methods:  Out of 3,301 MRIs from 12 sites in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Stroke Genetics Network (SiGN), we included 2,381 cases with acute DWI lesions. The definition of ACiS or PCiS was based on lesion location. We compared the groups using Chi-squared and logistic regression. 
  Results:  PCiS occurred in 718 (30%) patients and ACiS in 1663 (70%). Diabetes and male sex were more common in PCiS vs. ACiS (diabetes 27% vs. 23%, p &lt; 0.05; male sex 68% vs. 58%, p &lt; 0.001). Both were independently associated with PCiS (diabetes, OR = 1.29; 95% CI 1.04-1.61; male sex, OR = 1.46; 95% CI 1.21-1.78). ACiS more commonly had large artery atherosclerosis (25% vs. 20%, p &lt; 0.01) and cardioembolic mechanisms (17% vs. 11%, p &lt; 0.001) compared to PCiS. Small artery occlusion was more common in PCiS vs. ACiS (20% vs. 14%, p &lt; 0.001). Small artery occlusion accounted for 47% of solitary brainstem infarctions. 
  Conclusion:  Ischemic stroke subtypes differ between the two phenotypes. Diabetes and male sex have a stronger association with PCiS than ACiS. Definitive MRI-based PCiS diagnosis aids etiological investigation and contributes additional insights into specific risk factors and mechanisms of injury in PCiS.

10.1186/s12872-020-01455-8  |  Prognosis  |  Prognosis  |  Logistic Regression  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Chest pain is one of the most common complaints among patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). Causes of chest pain can be benign or life threatening, making accurate risk stratification a critical issue in the ED. In addition to the use of established clinical scores, prior studies have attempted to create predictive models with heart rate variability (HRV). In this study, we proposed heart rate n-variability (HRnV), an alternative representation of beat-to-beat variation in electrocardiogram (ECG), and investigated its association with major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in ED patients with chest pain. 
  Methods:  We conducted a retrospective analysis of data collected from the ED of a tertiary hospital in Singapore between September 2010 and July 2015. Patients &gt; 20 years old who presented to the ED with chief complaint of chest pain were conveniently recruited. Five to six-minute single-lead ECGs, demographics, medical history, troponin, and other required variables were collected. We developed the HRnV-Calc software to calculate HRnV parameters. The primary outcome was 30-day MACE, which included all-cause death, acute myocardial infarction, and revascularization. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate the association between individual risk factors and the outcome. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to compare the HRnV model (based on leave-one-out cross-validation) against other clinical scores in predicting 30-day MACE. 
  Results:  A total of 795 patients were included in the analysis, of which 247 (31%) had MACE within 30 days. The MACE group was older, with a higher proportion being male patients. Twenty-one conventional HRV and 115 HRnV parameters were calculated. In univariable analysis, eleven HRV and 48 HRnV parameters were significantly associated with 30-day MACE. The multivariable stepwise logistic regression identified 16 predictors that were strongly associated with MACE outcome; these predictors consisted of one HRV, seven HRnV parameters, troponin, ST segment changes, and several other factors. The HRnV model outperformed several clinical scores in the ROC analysis. 
  Conclusions:  The novel HRnV representation demonstrated its value of augmenting HRV and traditional risk factors in designing a robust risk stratification tool for patients with chest pain in the ED.

10.1039/d0cs00098a  |  Drug Discovery  |  Prognosis, Drug Discovery  |  AITechniqueM  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Review  |   Prediction of chemical bioactivity and physical properties has been one of the most important applications of statistical and more recently, machine learning and artificial intelligence methods in chemical sciences. This field of research, broadly known as quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) modeling, has developed many important algorithms and has found a broad range of applications in physical organic and medicinal chemistry in the past 55+ years. This Perspective summarizes recent technological advances in QSAR modeling but it also highlights the applicability of algorithms, modeling methods, and validation practices developed in QSAR to a wide range of research areas outside of traditional QSAR boundaries including synthesis planning, nanotechnology, materials science, biomaterials, and clinical informatics. As modern research methods generate rapidly increasing amounts of data, the knowledge of robust data-driven modelling methods professed within the QSAR field can become essential for scientists working both within and outside of chemical research. We hope that this contribution highlighting the generalizable components of QSAR modeling will serve to address this challenge.

To characterize the cell types and circuit diagram of clonally related excitatory neurons, we performed multi-cell patch clamp recordings and Patch-seq on neurons derived from <i>Nestin</i>-positive progenitors labeled by tamoxifen induction at embryonic day 10.5. The resulting clones are derived from two radial glia on average, span cortical layers 2-6, and are composed of a random sampling of transcriptomic cell types. We find an interaction between shared lineage and connection type: related neurons are more likely to be connected vertically across cortical layers, but not laterally within the same layer. These findings challenge the view that related neurons show uniformly increased connectivity and suggest that integration of vertical <i>intra</i>-clonal input with lateral <i>inter</i>-clonal input may represent a developmentally programmed connectivity motif supporting the emergence of functional circuits.

A growing number of studies have used these approaches to link cancer evolution with clinical progression and response to therapy. Although the inference of tumor phylogenies is rapidly becoming standard practice in cancer genome analyses, standards for evaluating them are lacking. To address this need, we systematically assess methods for reconstructing tumor subclonality. First, we elucidate the main algorithmic problems in subclonal reconstruction and develop quantitative metrics for evaluating them. Then we simulate realistic tumor genomes that harbor all known clonal and subclonal mutation types and processes. Finally, we benchmark 580 tumor reconstructions, varying tumor read depth, tumor type and somatic variant detection. Our analysis provides a baseline for the establishment of gold-standard methods to analyze tumor heterogeneity.

10.1016/j.media.2019.101561  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis, Treatment  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Review  |   Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is the most common cause of avoidable vision loss, predominantly affecting the working-age population across the globe. Screening for DR, coupled with timely consultation and treatment, is a globally trusted policy to avoid vision loss. However, implementation of DR screening programs is challenging due to the scarcity of medical professionals able to screen a growing global diabetic population at risk for DR. Computer-aided disease diagnosis in retinal image analysis could provide a sustainable approach for such large-scale screening effort. The recent scientific advances in computing capacity and machine learning approaches provide an avenue for biomedical scientists to reach this goal. Aiming to advance the state-of-the-art in automatic DR diagnosis, a grand challenge on "Diabetic Retinopathy - Segmentation and Grading" was organized in conjunction with the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI - 2018). In this paper, we report the set-up and results of this challenge that is primarily based on Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset (IDRiD). There were three principal sub-challenges: lesion segmentation, disease severity grading, and localization of retinal landmarks and segmentation. These multiple tasks in this challenge allow to test the generalizability of algorithms, and this is what makes it different from existing ones. It received a positive response from the scientific community with 148 submissions from 495 registrations effectively entered in this challenge. This paper outlines the challenge, its organization, the dataset used, evaluation methods and results of top-performing participating solutions. The top-performing approaches utilized a blend of clinical information, data augmentation, and an ensemble of models. These findings have the potential to enable new developments in retinal image analysis and image-based DR screening in particular.

10.1148/radiol.2020201491  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis  |  EfficientNet B4 deep neural network  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Review  |   Background COVID-19 and pneumonia of other etiology share similar CT characteristics, contributing to the challenges in differentiating them with high accuracy. Purpose To establish and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI) system in differentiating COVID-19 and other pneumonia on chest CT and assess radiologist performance without and with AI assistance. Methods 521 patients with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19 and abnormal chest CT findings were retrospectively identified from ten hospitals from January 2020 to April 2020. 665 patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia and definite evidence of pneumonia on chest CT were retrospectively selected from three hospitals between 2017 and 2019. To classify COVID-19 versus other pneumonia for each patient, abnormal CT slices were input into the EfficientNet B4 deep neural network architecture after lung segmentation, followed by two-layer fully-connected neural network to pool slices together. Our final cohort of 1,186 patients (132,583 CT slices) was divided into training, validation and test sets in a 7:2:1 and equal ratio. Independent testing was performed by evaluating model performance on separate hospitals. Studies were blindly reviewed by six radiologists without and then with AI assistance. Results Our final model achieved a test accuracy of 96% (95% CI: 90-98%), sensitivity 95% (95% CI: 83-100%) and specificity of 96% (95% CI: 88-99%) with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) AUC of 0.95 and Precision-Recall (PR) AUC of 0.90. On independent testing, our model achieved an accuracy of 87% (95% CI: 82-90%), sensitivity of 89% (95% CI: 81-94%) and specificity of 86% (95% CI: 80-90%) with ROC AUC of 0.90 and PR AUC of 0.87. Assisted by the models' probabilities, the radiologists achieved a higher average test accuracy (90% vs. 85%, Δ=5, p&lt;0.001), sensitivity (88% vs. 79%, Δ=9, p&lt;0.001) and specificity (91% vs. 88%, Δ=3, p=0.001). Conclusion AI assistance improved radiologists' performance in distinguishing COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 pneumonia on chest CT.

10.2196/15022  |  Treatment, Smart Healthcare, Prognosis  |  Prognosis, Treatment, Smart Healthcare  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Review  |    Background:  Alternative evidence-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) delivery models that overcome significant barriers to access and delivery are needed to address persistent low utilization. Models utilizing contemporary digital technologies could significantly improve reach and fidelity as complementary alternatives to traditional center-based programs. 
  Objective:  The aim of this study is to compare the effects and costs of the innovative Smartphone Cardiac Rehabilitation, Assisted self-Management (SCRAM) intervention with usual care CR. 
  Methods:  In this investigator-, assessor-, and statistician-blinded parallel 2-arm randomized controlled trial, 220 adults (18+ years) with coronary heart disease are being recruited from 3 hospitals in metropolitan and regional Victoria, Australia. Participants are randomized (1:1) to receive advice to engage with usual care CR or the SCRAM intervention. SCRAM is a 24-week dual-phase intervention that includes 12 weeks of real-time remote exercise supervision and coaching from exercise physiologists, which is followed by 12 weeks of data-driven nonreal-time remote coaching via telephone. Both intervention phases include evidence- and theory-based multifactorial behavior change support delivered via smartphone push notifications. Outcomes assessed at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks include maximal aerobic exercise capacity (primary outcome at 24 weeks), modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, exercise adherence, secondary prevention self-management behaviors, health-related quality of life, and adverse events. Economic and process evaluations will determine cost-effectiveness and participant perceptions of the treatment arms, respectively. 
  Results:  The trial was funded in November 2017 and received ethical approval in June 2018. Recruitment began in November 2018. As of September 2019, 54 participants have been randomized into the trial. 
  Conclusions:  The innovative multiphase SCRAM intervention delivers real-time remote exercise supervision and evidence-based self-management behavioral support to participants, regardless of their geographic proximity to traditional center-based CR facilities. Our trial will provide unique and valuable information about effects of SCRAM on outcomes associated with cardiac and all-cause mortality, as well as acceptability and cost-effectiveness. These findings will be important to inform health care providers about the potential for innovative program delivery models, such as SCRAM, to be implemented at scale, as a complement to existing CR programs. The inclusion of a cohort comprising metropolitan-, regional-, and rural-dwelling participants will help to understand the role of this delivery model across health care contexts with diverse needs.

10.1038/s10038-020-0733-y  |  Diagnosis, Genetics  |  Diagnosis, Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Recently, a recessively inherited intronic repeat expansion in replication factor C1 (RFC1) was identified in cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and bilateral vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). Here, we describe a Japanese case of genetically confirmed CANVAS with autonomic failure and auditory hallucination. The case showed impaired uptake of iodine-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine and <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane in the cardiac sympathetic nerve and dopaminergic neurons, respectively, by single-photon emission computed tomography. Long-read sequencing identified biallelic pathogenic (AAGGG)n nucleotide repeat expansion in RFC1 and heterozygous benign (TAAAA)n and (TAGAA)n expansions in brain expressed, associated with NEDD4 (BEAN1). Enrichment of the repeat regions in RFC1 and BEAN1 using a Cas9-mediated system clearly distinguished between pathogenic and benign repeat expansions. The haplotype around RFC1 indicated that the (AAGGG)n expansion in our case was on the same ancestral allele as that of European cases. Thus, long-read sequencing facilitates precise genetic diagnosis of diseases with complex repeat structures and various expansions.

However, there is substantial inconsistency among studies that have investigated functional brain alterations in AD; such contradictions have hindered efforts to elucidate the core disease mechanisms. In this study, we aim to comprehensively characterize AD-associated functional brain alterations using one of the world's largest resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) biobank for the disorder. The biobank includes fMRI data from six neuroimaging centers, with a total of 252 AD patients, 221 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and 215 healthy comparison individuals. Meta-analytic techniques were used to unveil reliable differences in brain function among the three groups. Relative to the healthy comparison group, AD was associated with significantly reduced functional connectivity and local activity in the default-mode network, basal ganglia and cingulate gyrus, along with increased connectivity or local activity in the prefrontal lobe and hippocampus (p &lt; .05, Bonferroni corrected). Moreover, these functional alterations were significantly correlated with the degree of cognitive impairment (AD and MCI groups) and amyloid-β burden. Machine learning models were trained to recognize key fMRI features to predict individual diagnostic status and clinical score. Leave-one-site-out cross-validation established that diagnostic status (mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.85) and clinical score (mean correlation coefficient between predicted and actual Mini-Mental State Examination scores: 0.56, p &lt; .0001) could be predicted with high accuracy. Collectively, our findings highlight the potential for a reproducible and generalizable functional brain imaging biomarker to aid the early diagnosis of AD and track its progression.

Tumor cells display major differences when compared to their natural counterparts, due to alterations in fundamental cellular processes such as glycosylation. Glycans are involved in tumor cell biology and they have been considered to be suitable cancer biomarkers. Thus, more selective cancer screening assays can be developed through the detection of specific altered glycans on the surface of circulating cancer cells. Currently, this is only possible through time-consuming assays. In this work, we propose the "intelligent" Lab on Fiber (iLoF) device, that has a high-resolution, and which is a fast and portable method for tumor single-cell type identification and isolation. We apply an Artificial Intelligence approach to the back-scattered signal arising from a trapped cell by a micro-lensed optical fiber. As a proof of concept, we show that iLoF is able to discriminate two human cancer cell models sharing the same genetic background but displaying a different surface glycosylation profile with an accuracy above 90% and a speed rate of 2.3 seconds. We envision the incorporation of the iLoF in an easy-to-operate microchip for cancer identification, which would allow further biological characterization of the captured circulating live cells.

10.1056/NEJMoa1917130  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis  |  Deep Learning, Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Nonophthalmologist physicians do not confidently perform direct ophthalmoscopy. The use of artificial intelligence to detect papilledema and other optic-disk abnormalities from fundus photographs has not been well studied. 
  Methods:  We trained, validated, and externally tested a deep-learning system to classify optic disks as being normal or having papilledema or other abnormalities from 15,846 retrospectively collected ocular fundus photographs that had been obtained with pharmacologic pupillary dilation and various digital cameras in persons from multiple ethnic populations. Of these photographs, 14,341 from 19 sites in 11 countries were used for training and validation, and 1505 photographs from 5 other sites were used for external testing. Performance at classifying the optic-disk appearance was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity, as compared with a reference standard of clinical diagnoses by neuro-ophthalmologists. 
  Results:  The training and validation data sets from 6779 patients included 14,341 photographs: 9156 of normal disks, 2148 of disks with papilledema, and 3037 of disks with other abnormalities. The percentage classified as being normal ranged across sites from 9.8 to 100%; the percentage classified as having papilledema ranged across sites from zero to 59.5%. In the validation set, the system discriminated disks with papilledema from normal disks and disks with nonpapilledema abnormalities with an AUC of 0.99 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.98 to 0.99) and normal from abnormal disks with an AUC of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.99 to 0.99). In the external-testing data set of 1505 photographs, the system had an AUC for the detection of papilledema of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95 to 0.97), a sensitivity of 96.4% (95% CI, 93.9 to 98.3), and a specificity of 84.7% (95% CI, 82.3 to 87.1). 
  Conclusions:  A deep-learning system using fundus photographs with pharmacologically dilated pupils differentiated among optic disks with papilledema, normal disks, and disks with nonpapilledema abnormalities.

10.1038/s41746-020-0266-y  |  Diagnosis, Treatment  |  Diagnosis, Treatment  |  CNN  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening clinical problem and computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the gold standard for diagnosis. Prompt diagnosis and immediate treatment are critical to avoid high morbidity and mortality rates, yet PE remains among the diagnoses most frequently missed or delayed. In this study, we developed a deep learning model-PENet, to automatically detect PE on volumetric CTPA scans as an end-to-end solution for this purpose. The PENet is a 77-layer 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) pretrained on the Kinetics-600 dataset and fine-tuned on a retrospective CTPA dataset collected from a single academic institution. The PENet model performance was evaluated in detecting PE on data from two different institutions: one as a hold-out dataset from the same institution as the training data and a second collected from an external institution to evaluate model generalizability to an unrelated population dataset. PENet achieved an AUROC of 0.84 [0.82-0.87] on detecting PE on the hold out internal test set and 0.85 [0.81-0.88] on external dataset. PENet also outperformed current state-of-the-art 3D CNN models. The results represent successful application of an end-to-end 3D CNN model for the complex task of PE diagnosis without requiring computationally intensive and time consuming preprocessing and demonstrates sustained performance on data from an external institution. Our model could be applied as a triage tool to automatically identify clinically important PEs allowing for prioritization for diagnostic radiology interpretation and improved care pathways via more efficient diagnosis.

10.1016/j.cmpb.2019.105153  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis  |  SVM, Random Forest  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background and objectives:  Malignant lymphomas are cancers of the immune system and are characterized by enlarged lymph nodes that typically spread across many different sites. Many different histological subtypes exist, whose diagnosis is typically based on sampling (biopsy) of a single tumor site, whereas total body examinations with computed tomography and positron emission tomography, though not diagnostic, are able to provide a comprehensive picture of the patient. In this work, we exploit a data-driven approach based on multiple-instance learning algorithms and texture analysis features extracted from positron emission tomography, to predict differential diagnosis of the main malignant lymphomas subtypes. 
  Methods:  We exploit a multiple-instance learning setting where support vector machines and random forests are used as classifiers both at the level of single VOIs (instances) and at the level of patients (bags). We present results on two datasets comprising patients that suffer from four different types of malignant lymphomas, namely diffuse large B cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma. 
  Results:  Despite the complexity of the task, experimental results show that, with sufficient data samples, some cancer subtypes, such as the Hodgkin's lymphoma, can be identified from texture information: in particular, we achieve a 97.0% of sensitivity (recall) and a 94.1% of predictive positive value (precision) on a dataset that consists in 60 patients. 
  Conclusions:  The presented study indicates that texture analysis features extracted from positron emission tomography, combined with multiple-instance machine learning algorithms, can be discriminating for different malignant lymphomas subtypes.

10.1002/advs.201902699  |  None  |  Diagnosis  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Terahertz (THz) photon detection is of particular appealing for myriad applications, but it still lags behind efficient manipulation with electronics and photonics due to the lack of a suitable principle satisfying both high sensitivity and fast response at room temperature. Here, a new strategy is proposed to overcome these limitations by exploring the photothermoelectric (PTE) effect in an ultrashort (down to 30 nm) channel with black phosphorus as a photoactive material. The preferential flow of hot carriers is enabled by the asymmetric Cr/Au and Ti/Au metallization with the titled-angle evaporation technique. Most intriguingly, orders of magnitude field-enhancement beyond the skin-depth limit and photon absorption across a broadband frequency can be achieved. The PTE detector has excellent sensitivity of 297 V W<sup>-1</sup>, noise equivalent power less than 58 pW/Hz<sup>0.5</sup>, and response time below 0.8 ms, which is superior to other thermal-based detectors at room temperature. A rigorous comparison with existing THz detectors, together with verification by further optical-pumping and imaging experiments, substantiates the importance of the localized field effect in the skin-depth limit. The results allow solid understanding on the role of PTE effect played in the THz photoresponse, opening up new opportunities for developing highly sensitive THz detectors for addressing targeted applications.

10.1002/cti2.1105  |  Prognosis  |  Prognosis, Treatment  |  Random Forest  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Objectives:  T cells play an essential role in controlling the development of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders (BLPDs), but the dysfunction of T cells in BLPDs largely remains elusive. 
  Methods:  Using multiplexed flow cytometry, we quantified all major subsets of CD4<sup>+</sup> helper T cells (Th) and CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells (Tc) in 94 BLPD patients and 66 healthy controls. Statistics was utilised to rank T-cell signatures that distinguished BLPDs from healthy controls and differentially presented between indolent and aggressive categories. 
  Results:  By comparing with healthy controls, we found that the indolent but not aggressive type of BLPDs demonstrated a high degree of T-cell activation, showing the increase in type I helper T (Th1) cells and follicular B-helper T (Tfh) cells, both of which strongly associated with the enhanced differentiation of exhaustion-like effector cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing PD-1 (Tc exhaustion-like) in indolent BLPDs. Random forest modelling selected a module of T-cell immune signatures best performing binary classification of all BLPD patients. This signature module was composed of low naïve Th cells and high Th1, Tfh and Tc exhaustion-like cells which efficiently identified &gt; 85% indolent cases and was, therefore, assigned as the Indolent Dominant Module of T-cell immune signature. In indolent BLPD patients, a strong bias towards such signatures was found to associate with clinical characteristics of worse prognosis. 
  Conclusion:  Our study identified a prominent signature of T-cell dysregulation specifically for indolent BLPDs, suggesting Th1, Tfh and Tc exhaustion-like cells represent potential prognostic biomarkers and targets for immunotherapies.

10.3988/jcn.2020.16.2.202  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis  |  Diagnosis  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background and purpose:  Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition with diverse clinical outcomes and subgroups. Here we investigated the topographic distribution of tau in vivo using the positron emission tomography (PET) tracer [¹⁸F]THK5351 in MCI subgroups. 
  Methods:  This study included 96 participants comprising 38 with amnestic MCI (aMCI), 21 with nonamnestic MCI (naMCI), and 37 with normal cognition (NC) who underwent 3.0-T MRI, [¹⁸F]THK5351 PET, and detailed neuropsychological tests. [¹⁸F]flutemetamol PET was also performed in 62 participants. The aMCI patients were further divided into three groups: 1) verbal-aMCI, only verbal memory impairment; 2) visual-aMCI, only visual memory impairment; and 3) both-aMCI, both visual and verbal memory impairment. Voxel-wise statistical analysis and region-of-interest -based analyses were performed to evaluate the retention of [¹⁸F]THK5351 in the MCI subgroups. Subgroup analysis of amyloid-positive and -negative MCI patients was also performed. Correlations between [¹⁸F]THK5351 retention and different neuropsychological tests were evaluated using statistical parametric mapping analyses. 
  Results:  [¹⁸F]THK5351 retention in the lateral temporal, mesial temporal, parietal, frontal, posterior cingulate cortices and precuneus was significantly greater in aMCI patients than in NC subjects, whereas it did not differ significantly between naMCI and NC participants. [¹⁸F] THK5351 retention was greater in the both-aMCI group than in the verbal-aMCI and visualaMCI groups, and greater in amyloid-positive than amyloid-negative MCI patients. The cognitive function scores were significantly correlated with cortical [¹⁸F]THK5351 retention. 
  Conclusions:  [¹⁸F]THK5351 PET might be useful for identifying distinct topographic patterns of [¹⁸F]THK5351 retention in subgroups of MCI patients who are at greater risk of the progression to Alzheimer's dementia.

10.1210/clinem/dgz141  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis  |  Random Forest  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Review  |    Context:  Urine steroid metabolomics, combining mass spectrometry-based steroid profiling and machine learning, has been described as a novel diagnostic tool for detection of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). 
  Objective, design, setting:  This proof-of-concept study evaluated the performance of urine steroid metabolomics as a tool for postoperative recurrence detection after microscopically complete (R0) resection of ACC. 
  Patients and methods:  135 patients from 14 clinical centers provided postoperative urine samples, which were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We assessed the utility of these urine steroid profiles in detecting ACC recurrence, either when interpreted by expert clinicians or when analyzed by random forest, a machine learning-based classifier. Radiological recurrence detection served as the reference standard. 
  Results:  Imaging detected recurrent disease in 42 of 135 patients; 32 had provided pre- and post-recurrence urine samples. 39 patients remained disease-free for ≥3 years. The urine "steroid fingerprint" at recurrence resembled that observed before R0 resection in the majority of cases. Review of longitudinally collected urine steroid profiles by 3 blinded experts detected recurrence by the time of radiological diagnosis in 50% to 72% of cases, improving to 69% to 92%, if a preoperative urine steroid result was available. Recurrence detection by steroid profiling preceded detection by imaging by more than 2 months in 22% to 39% of patients. Specificities varied considerably, ranging from 61% to 97%. The computational classifier detected ACC recurrence with superior accuracy (sensitivity = specificity = 81%). 
  Conclusion:  Urine steroid metabolomics is a promising tool for postoperative recurrence detection in ACC; availability of a preoperative urine considerably improves the ability to detect ACC recurrence.

10.1016/j.media.2020.101652  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis  |  SVM  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Detection of early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) is important to maximize the chances to delay or prevent progression to AD. Brain connectivity networks inferred from medical imaging data have been commonly used to distinguish MCI patients from normal controls (NC). However, existing methods still suffer from limited performance, and classification remains mainly based on single modality data. This paper proposes a new model to automatically diagnosing MCI (early MCI (EMCI) and late MCI (LMCI)) and its earlier stages (i.e., significant memory concern (SMC)) by combining low-rank self-calibrated functional brain networks and structural brain networks for joint multi-task learning. Specifically, we first develop a new functional brain network estimation method. We introduce data quality indicators for self-calibration, which can improve data quality while completing brain network estimation, and perform correlation analysis combined with low-rank structure. Second, functional and structural connected neuroimaging patterns are integrated into our multi-task learning model to select discriminative and informative features for fine MCI analysis. Different modalities are best suited to undertake distinct classification tasks, and similarities and differences among multiple tasks are best determined through joint learning to determine most discriminative features. The learning process is completed by non-convex regularizer, which effectively reduces the penalty bias of trace norm and approximates the original rank minimization problem. Finally, the most relevant disease features classified using a support vector machine (SVM) for MCI identification. Experimental results show that our method achieves promising performance with high classification accuracy and can effectively discriminate between different sub-stages of MCI.

10.1016/j.jcmg.2019.06.027  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Objectives:  This study was conducted to investigate the influence of coronary artery calcium (CAC) score on the diagnostic performance of machine-learning-based coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography (cCTA)-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR). 
  Background:  CT-FFR is used reliably to detect lesion-specific ischemia. Novel CT-FFR algorithms using machine-learning artificial intelligence techniques perform fast and require less complex computational fluid dynamics. Yet, influence of CAC score on diagnostic performance of the machine-learning approach has not been investigated. 
  Methods:  A total of 482 vessels from 314 patients (age 62.3 ± 9.3 years, 77% male) who underwent cCTA followed by invasive FFR were investigated from the MACHINE (Machine Learning based CT Angiography derived FFR: a Multi-center Registry) registry data. CAC scores were quantified using the Agatston convention. The diagnostic performance of CT-FFR to detect lesion-specific ischemia was assessed across all Agatston score categories (CAC 0, &gt;0 to &lt;100, 100 to &lt;400, and ≥400) on a per-vessel level with invasive FFR as the reference standard. 
  Results:  The diagnostic accuracy of CT-FFR versus invasive FFR was superior to cCTA alone on a per-vessel level (78% vs. 60%) and per patient level (83% vs. 73%) across all Agatston score categories. No statistically significant differences in the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, or specificity of CT-FFR were observed across the categories. CT-FFR showed good discriminatory power in vessels with high Agatston scores (CAC ≥400) and high performance in low-to-intermediate Agatston scores (CAC &gt;0 to &lt;400) with a statistically significant difference in the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) (AUC: 0.71 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.57 to 0.85] vs. 0.85 [95% CI: 0.82 to 0.89], p = 0.04). CT-FFR showed superior diagnostic value over cCTA in vessels with high Agatston scores (CAC ≥ 400: AUC 0.71 vs. 0.55, p = 0.04) and low-to-intermediate Agatston scores (CAC &gt;0 to &lt;400: AUC 0.86 vs. 0.63, p &lt; 0.001). 
  Conclusions:  Machine-learning-based CT-FFR showed superior diagnostic performance over cCTA alone in CAC with a significant difference in the performance of CT-FFR as calcium burden/Agatston calcium score increased.

In this study, we investigate the temporal requirements for fear conditioning association between a strong artificial CS, high-frequency optogenetic activation of inputs into the lateral amygdala of rats, and a foot-shock to the animal with delays up to many minutes. 
  Methods:  AAV-oChIEF-tdTomato viruses were injected into the auditory cortex and the medial geniculate nucleus of rats. An optical fiber was implanted just above the lateral amygdala of the animal. Optogenetic high-frequency stimuli (oHFS; containing five 1-s trains of 100 Hz laser pulses) were delivered to the lateral amygdala, before or after (with varying intervals) a foot-shock that elicits fear responses in the animal. Pre-trained lever-press behavior was used to assess the degree of fear recall by optogenetic test stimuli (OTS; 10 Hz for 2 min) 24 h after the association experiment. 
  Results:  In contrast to the tight temporal requirement for classical conditioning with paired optogenetic moderate-frequency stimuli (oMFS; 10 Hz for 20 s) and foot-shock, oHFS followed by foot-shock with a 5-min or even 1-h (but not 3-h) interval could successfully establish an association to be recalled by OTS the next day. Meanwhile, foot-shock followed by oHFS with a 5-min (but not 1-h) interval could also establish the conditioning. Thus, distant association may be formed between temporally distant stimuli when the CS is strong.

PMID:32060190  |  Smart Healthcare  |  Smart Healthcare  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Review  |    Objective:  To contrast how Brazil's and Canada's different jurisdictional and judicial realities have led to different types of telemedicine and how further scale and improvement can be achieved. 
  Composition of the committee:  A subgroup of the Besrour Centre of the College of Family Physicians of Canada and Canadian telemedicine experts developed connections with colleagues in Porto Alegre, Brazil, and collaborated to undertake a between-country comparison of their respective telemedicine programs. 
  Methods:  Following a literature review, the authors collectively reflected on their experiences in an attempt to explore the past and current state of telemedicine in Canada and Brazil. 
  Report:  Both Brazil and Canada share expansive geographies, creating substantial barriers to health for rural patients. Telemedicine is an important part of a universal health system. Both countries have achieved telemedicine programs that have scaled up across large regions and are showing important effects on health care costs and outcomes. However, each system is unique in design and implementation and faces unique challenges for further scale and improvement. Addressing regional differences, the normalization of telemedicine, and potential alignment of telemedicine and artificial intelligence technologies for health care are seen as promising approaches to scaling up and improving telemedicine in both countries. 
  Objectif:  Comparer la manière dont les différentes réalités territoriales et judiciaires du Brésil et du Canada ont mené à différents types de télémédecine et déterminer comment l’expansion à plus grande échelle, ainsi que des améliorations peuvent être réalisées. 
  Composition du comité:  Un sous-groupe du Centre Besrour du Collège des médecins de famille du Canada et des experts canadiens en télémédecine ont établi des liens avec des collègues de Porto Alegre, au Brésil, et ont collaboré pour entreprendre une comparaison entre les programmes de télémédecine des deux pays. 
  Méthodes:  Après une revue de la documentation, les auteurs ont fait une réflexion collective sur leurs expériences afin d’explorer l’état passé et actuel de la télémédecine au Canada et au Brésil. 
  Rapport:  Le Brésil et le Canada couvrent tous deux de vastes territoires géographiques, ce qui crée des obstacles importants à la santé des patients des zones rurales. La télémédecine est un élément important d’un système de santé universel. Les deux pays ont mis en place des programmes de télémédecine qui s’étendent sur de vastes régions et qui ont des effets importants sur les coûts des soins et la santé des populations. Toutefois, chaque système est unique dans sa conception et sa mise en œuvre et se heurte à des difficultés particulières qui entravent son expansion. La prise en compte des différences régionales, la normalisation de la télémédecine et l’harmonisation potentielle des technologies de télémédecine et d’intelligence artificielle pour les soins de santé sont considérées comme des approches prometteuses pour le développement et l’amélioration de la télémédecine dans ces deux pays.

10.1155/2020/3658795  |  Smart Healthcare  |  Diagnosis, Smart Healthcare  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Recently, brain-machine interfacing is very popular that link humans and artificial devices through brain signals which lead to corresponding mobile application as supplementary. The Android platform has developed rapidly because of its good user experience and openness. Meanwhile, these characteristics of this platform, which cause the amazing pace of Android malware, pose a great threat to this platform and data correction during signal transmission of brain-machine interfacing. Many previous works employ various behavioral characteristics to analyze Android application (or app) and detect Android malware to protect signal data secure. However, with the development of Android app, category of Android app tends to be diverse, and the Android malware behavior tends to be complex. This situation makes existing Android malware detections complicated and inefficient. In this paper, we propose a broad analysis, gathering as many behavior characteristics of an app as possible and compare these behavior characteristics in several metrics. First, we extract static and dynamic behavioral characteristic from Android app in an automatic manner. Second, we explain the decision we made in each kind of behavioral characteristic we choose for Android app analysis and Android malware detection. Third, we design a detailed experiment, which compare the efficiency of each kind of behavior characteristic in different aspects. The results of experiment also show Android malware detection performance of these behavior characteristics combine with well-known machine learning algorithms.

However, robotics in fracture reduction remains at the infant stage. As essential components of the current robotic system, external fixators were used in fracture reduction, including the unilateral and Ilizarov-like ring fixators. With emerging of the industrial robots and mechanical arms, their sterilized variants were developed as the serial robots, including the traction device and robotic arm, for fracture reduction. Besides, parallel robots (e.g., Gough-Stewart platform) were devised for lower extremity traction and fracture reduction. After combining the advantages of the serial and parallel mechanisms, hybrid robots can fulfill specific clinical requirements (e.g., the joint fracture, including multiple major fragments). Furthermore, with the aid of intra-operative navigation systems, fracture reduction can be performed under real-time guidance. The paper presents a comprehensive overview of the advancement of the robots in fracture reduction and evaluates research challenges and future perspectives, including ergonomic and economic issues, operation time, artificial realities and intelligence, and telesurgery.

The low success rate of FXR agonists' R&amp;D and the side effects of clinical candidates such as obeticholic acid make it urgent to discover new chemotypes. Unfortunately, structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) that can speed up drug discovery has rarely been reported with success for FXR, which was likely hindered by the failure in addressing protein flexibility. To address this issue, we devised human FXR (hFXR)-specific ensemble learning models based on pose filters from 24 agonist-bound hFXR crystal structures and coupled them to traditional SBVS approaches of the FRED docking plus Chemgauss4 scoring function. It turned out that the hFXR-specific pose filter ensemble (PFE) was able to improve ligand enrichment significantly, which rendered 3RUT-based SBVS with its PFE the ideal approach for FXR agonist discovery. By screening of the Specs chemical library and in vitro FXR transactivation bioassay, we identified a new class of FXR agonists with compound XJ034 as the representative, which would have been missed if the PFE was not coupled. Following that, we performed in-depth biological studies which demonstrated that XJ034 resulted in a downtrend of intracellular triglyceride in vitro, significantly decreased the serum/liver TG in high fat diet-induced C57BL/6J obese mice, and more importantly, showed metabolic stabilities in both plasma and liver microsomes. To provide insight into further structure-based lead optimization, we solved the crystal structure of hFXR complexed with compound XJ034, uncovering a unique hydrogen bond between compound XJ034 and residue Y375. The current work highlights the power of our pose filter-based ensemble learning approach in terms of scaffold hopping and provides a promising lead compound for further development.

How these attentional fluctuations coincide with spatial exploration/displacement and exploitation/selection by a dynamic attentional spotlight under top-down control is unclear. Here, we show a direct contribution of prefrontal attention selection mechanisms to a continuous space exploration. Specifically, we provide a direct high spatio-temporal resolution prefrontal population decoding of the covert attentional spotlight. We show that it continuously explores space at a 7-12 Hz rhythm. Sensory encoding and behavioral reports are increased at a specific optimal phase w/ to this rhythm. We propose that this prefrontal neuronal rhythm reflects an alpha-clocked sampling of the visual environment in the absence of eye movements. These attentional explorations are highly flexible, how they spatially unfold depending both on within-trial and across-task contingencies. These results are discussed in the context of exploration-exploitation strategies and prefrontal top-down attentional control.

Certain chemotherapeutics from the oncological armamentarium are able to trigger pre-mortem stress signals that lead to immunogenic cell death (ICD), thus inducing an antitumor immune response and mediating long-term tumor growth reduction. Here, we used an established model, built on artificial intelligence to identify, among a library of 50,000 compounds, anticancer agents that, based on their molecular descriptors, were predicted to induce ICD. This algorithm led us to the identification of dactinomycin (DACT, best known as actinomycin D), a highly potent cytotoxicant and ICD inducer that mediates immune-dependent anticancer effects in vivo. Since DACT is commonly used as an inhibitor of DNA to RNA transcription, we investigated whether other experimentally established or algorithm-selected, clinically employed ICD inducers would share this characteristic. As a common leitmotif, a panel of pharmacological ICD stimulators inhibited transcription and secondarily translation. These results establish the inhibition of RNA synthesis as an initial event for ICD induction.

The risk of breast cancer can be increasingly better characterised with large epidemiological studies on genetic and non-genetic risk factors. Through new analyses, the evidence for high-penetrance genes as well as for low-penetrance genes was able to be improved. New data on denosumab and atezolizumab are available in the neoadjuvant situation as is a pooled appraisal of numerous studies on capecitabine in the curative situation. There is also an update to the overall survival data of pertuzumab in the adjuvant situation with a longer follow-up observation period.

10.1053/j.gastro.2020.02.036  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis  |  CNN  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background &amp; aims:  Narrow-band imaging (NBI) can be used to determine whether colorectal polyps are adenomatous or hyperplastic. We investigated whether an artificial intelligence (AI) system can increase the accuracy of characterizations of polyps by endoscopists of different skill levels. 
  Methods:  We developed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for evaluation of diminutive colorectal polyps, based on efficient neural architecture searches via parameter sharing with augmentation using narrow-band images of diminutive (≤5 mm) polyps, collected from October 2015 through October 2017 at the Seoul National University Hospital, Healthcare System Gangnam Center (training set). We trained the CNN using images from 1100 adenomatous polyps and 1050 hyperplastic polyps from 1379 patients. We then tested the system using 300 images of 180 adenomatous polyps and 120 hyperplastic polyps, obtained from January 2018 to May 2019. We compared the accuracy of 22 endoscopists of different skill levels (7 novices, 4 experts, and 11 NBI-trained experts) vs the CNN in evaluation of images (adenomatous vs hyperplastic) from 180 adenomatous and 120 hyperplastic polyps. The endoscopists then evaluated the polyp images with knowledge of the CNN-processed results. We conducted mixed-effect logistic and linear regression analyses to determine the effects of AI assistance on the accuracy of analysis of diminutive colorectal polyps by endoscopists (primary outcome). 
  Results:  The CNN distinguished adenomatous vs hyperplastic diminutive polyps with 86.7% accuracy, based on histologic analysis as the reference standard. Endoscopists distinguished adenomatous vs hyperplastic diminutive polyps with 82.5% overall accuracy (novices, 73.8% accuracy; experts, 83.8% accuracy; and NBI-trained experts, 87.6% accuracy). With knowledge of the CNN-processed results, the overall accuracy of the endoscopists increased to 88.5% (P&lt;.05). With knowledge of the CNN-processed results, the accuracy of novice endoscopists increased to 85.6% (P&lt;.05). The CNN-processed results significantly reduced endoscopist time of diagnosis (from 3.92 to 3.37 seconds per polyp, P=.042). 
  Conclusions:  We developed a CNN that significantly increases the accuracy of evaluation of diminutive colorectal polyps (as adenomatous vs hyperplastic) and reduces the time of diagnosis by endoscopists. This AI assistance system significantly increased the accuracy of analysis by novice endoscopists, who achieved near-expert levels of accuracy without extra training. The CNN assistance system can reduce the skill-level dependence of endoscopists and costs.

Design; Prospective, observational case series METHODS: Forty-one eyes of 41 patients (75.8±8.4 years; 22 female) from a tertiary referral hospital were included (Directional-Spread-in-Geographic-Atrophy (DSGA) natural history study; <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02051998" title="See in ClinicalTrials.gov">NCT02051998</a>). Mesopic, dark-adapted (DA) cyan and red sensitivity were assessed using fundus-controlled perimetry ("microperimetry"); retinal microstructure using spectral-domain optical-coherence-tomography (SD-OCT), fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and near-infrared-reflectance (IR) imaging. Layer-thicknesses and -intensities and FAF- and IR-intensities were extracted for each test-point. We evaluated the cross-validated mean absolute error (MAE) for random-forest-based predictions of retinal sensitivity with and without patient-specific training-data and the increase mean-squared error (%IncMSE) as measure of feature-importance. 
  Results:  Retinal sensitivity was predicted with a MAE of 4.64 dB for mesopic, 4.89 dB for DA cyan and 4.40 dB for DA red testing in absence of patient-specific data. Partial addition of patient-specific sensitivity data to the training sets decreased the MAE to 2.89 dB, 2.86 dB and 2.77 dB. For all three types of testing, the outer nuclear layer-thickness constituted the most important predictive feature (35.0, 42.22 and 53.74 %IncMSE). Spatially-resolved mapping of "inferred sensitivity" revealed regions with differential degrees of mesopic and DA cyan sensitivity loss outside of the GA lesions. 
  Conclusions:  "Inferred sensitivity" accurately reflected retinal function in patients with GA. Mapping of "inferred sensitivity" could facilitate monitoring of disease progression and serve as "quasi functional" surrogate outcome in clinical trials, especially in consideration of retinal regions beyond areas of GA.

10.1016/j.cmpb.2019.105059  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis  |  super-resolution convolution neural network (SRCNN), efficient sub-pixel convolution neural network (ESPCN)  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background and objective:  With the rapid development of medical imaging and intelligent diagnosis, artificial intelligence methods have become a research hotspot of radiography processing technology in recent years. The low definition of knee magnetic resonance image texture seriously affects the diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis. This paper presents a super-resolution reconstruction method to address this problem. 
  Methods:  In this paper, we propose an efficient medical image super-resolution (EMISR) method, in which we mainly adopted three hidden layers of super-resolution convolution neural network (SRCNN) and a sub-pixel convolution layer of efficient sub-pixel convolution neural network (ESPCN). The addition of the efficient sub-pixel convolutional layer in the hidden layer and the small network replacement consisting of concatenated convolutions to address low-resolution images but not high-resolution images are important. The EMISR method also uses cascaded small convolution kernels to improve reconstruction speed and deepen the convolution neural network to improve reconstruction quality. 
  Results:  The proposed method is tested in the public dataset IDI, and the reconstruction quality of the algorithm is higher than that of the sparse coding-based network (SCN) method, the SRCNN method, and the ESPCN method (+ 2.306 dB, + 2.540 dB, + 1.089 dB improved); moreover, the reconstruction speed is faster than its counterparts (+ 4.272 s, + 1.967 s, and + 0.073 s improved). 
  Conclusion:  The experimental results show that our EMISR framework has improved performance and greatly reduces the number of parameters and training time. Furthermore, the reconstructed image presents more details, and the edges are more complete. Therefore, the EMISR technique provides a more powerful medical analysis in knee osteoarthritis examinations.

10.1002/hbm.24856  |  Diagnosis, Genetics  |  Diagnosis, Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Thalamic atrophy is a common feature across all forms of FTD but little is known about specific nuclei involvement. We aimed to investigate in vivo atrophy of the thalamic nuclei across the FTD spectrum. A cohort of 402 FTD patients (age: mean(SD) 64.3(8.2) years; disease duration: 4.8(2.8) years) was compared with 104 age-matched controls (age: 62.5(10.4) years), using an automated segmentation of T1-weighted MRIs to extract volumes of 14 thalamic nuclei. Stratification was performed by clinical diagnosis (180 behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD), 85 semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), 114 nonfluent variant PPA (nfvPPA), 15 PPA not otherwise specified (PPA-NOS), and 8 with associated motor neurone disease (FTD-MND), genetic diagnosis (27 MAPT, 28 C9orf72, 18 GRN), and pathological confirmation (37 tauopathy, 38 TDP-43opathy, 4 FUSopathy). The mediodorsal nucleus (MD) was the only nucleus affected in all FTD subgroups (16-33% smaller than controls). The laterodorsal nucleus was also particularly affected in genetic cases (28-38%), TDP-43 type A (47%), tau-CBD (44%), and FTD-MND (53%). The pulvinar was affected only in the C9orf72 group (16%). Both the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei were also affected in the genetic cases (10-20%), particularly the LGN in C9orf72 expansion carriers. Use of individual thalamic nuclei volumes provided higher accuracy in discriminating between FTD groups than the whole thalamic volume. The MD is the only structure affected across all FTD groups. Differential involvement of the thalamic nuclei among FTD forms is seen, with a unique pattern of atrophy in the pulvinar in C9orf72 expansion carriers.

However, new advancements in statistical and machine learning algorithms continuously being updated the landslide susceptibility paradigm. This paper explores the predictive performance power of different sampling techniques in landslide susceptibility mapping in the wake of increased usage of artificial intelligence. We used logistic regression (LR), neural network (NNET), and deep learning neural network (DNN) model for testing and validation of the models. The tests were applied to the 2018 Hokkaido Earthquake affected areas using a set of 11 predictor variables (seismic, topographic, and hydrological). We found that the prediction rates are inconsequential with the DNN model irrespective of the sampling technique (AUC: 0.904 - 0.919). Whereas, testing with LR (AUC: 0.825 - 0.785) and NNET (AUC: 0.882 - 0.858) produces larger differences in the accuracies between the four datasets. Nonetheless, the highest success rates were obtained for samples within the landslide scarp area. The analogy was then validated with a published landslide inventory from the 2015 Gorkha earthquake. We, therefore, suggest that DNN models as an appropriate technique to increase the predictive performance of landslide susceptibilities if the landslide scarp and body are not characterized properly in an inventory.

Like their models in nature, many artificial mimics can effectively repel water, but fail when low-surface-tension liquids are introduced at the contact interface. A bioinspired fibrillar adhesive surface that is liquid-superrepellent even toward ultralow-surface-tension liquids while retaining its adhesive properties is proposed herein. This surface combines the effective adhesion principle of mushroom-shaped fibrillar arrays with liquid repellency based on double re-entrant fibril tip geometry. The adhesion performance of the proposed microfibril structures is retained even when low-surface-tension liquids are added to the contact interface. The extreme liquid repellency enables real-world applications of fibrillar adhesives for surfaces covered with water, oil, and other liquids. Moreover, fully elastomeric liquid-superrepellent surfaces are mechanically not brittle, highly robust against physical contact, and highly deformable and stretchable, which can increase the real-world uses of such antiwetting surfaces.

Persisting circadian misalignment leads to deleterious effects on health and healthspan. However, the underlying mechanism remains not fully understood. Here, we subjected adult, wild-type mice to distinct chronic jet-lag paradigms, which showed that long-term circadian misalignment induced significant early mortality. Non-biased RNA sequencing analysis using liver and kidney showed marked activation of gene regulatory pathways associated with the immune system and immune disease in both organs. In accordance, we observed enhanced steatohepatitis with infiltration of inflammatory cells. The investigation of senescence-associated immune cell subsets from the spleens and mesenteric lymph nodes revealed an increase in PD-1<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>high</sup> CD4 T cells as well as CD95<sup>+</sup>GL7<sup>+</sup> germinal center B cells, indicating that the long-term circadian misalignment exacerbates immune senescence and consequent chronic inflammation. Our results underscore immune homeostasis as a pivotal interventional target against clock-related disorders.

Hemicellulose (HC) is the second most abundant polysaccharide after cellulose in plants and a heterogeneous polysaccharide consisting of various saccharide units. The unique physical and chemical properties of hemicellulose make it a promising material for hydrogels. 
  Methods:  This review first summarizes the three research hotspots on the hemicellulose-based hydrogels: intelligence, biodegradability and biocompatibility.

10.1002/mp.13986  |  Treatment  |  Prognosis, Treatment  |  deep learning neural networks (DNN)  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Purpose:  Beam orientation selection, whether manual or protocol-based, is the current clinical standard in radiation therapy treatment planning, but it is tedious and can yield suboptimal results. Many algorithms have been designed to optimize beam orientation selection because of its impact on treatment plan quality, but these algorithms suffer from slow calculation of the dose influence matrices of all candidate beams. We propose a fast beam orientation selection method, based on deep learning neural networks (DNN), capable of developing a plan comparable to those developed by the state-of-the-art column generation (CG) method. Our model's novelty lies in its supervised learning structure (using CG to teach the network), DNN architecture, and ability to learn from anatomical features to predict dosimetrically suitable beam orientations without using dosimetric information from the candidate beams. This may save hours of computation. 
  Methods:  A supervised DNN is trained to mimic the CG algorithm, which iteratively chooses beam orientations one-by-one by calculating beam fitness values based on Karush-Kush-Tucker optimality conditions at each iteration. The DNN learns to predict these values. The dataset contains 70 prostate cancer patients - 50 training, 7 validation, and 13 test patients - to develop and test the model. Each patient's data contains 6 contours: PTV, body, bladder, rectum, and left and right femoral heads. Column generation was implemented with a GPU-based Chambolle-Pock algorithm, a first-order primal-dual proximal-class algorithm, to create 6270 plans. The DNN trained over 400 epochs, each with 2500 steps and a batch size of 1, using the Adam optimizer at a learning rate of 1 × 10<sup>-5</sup> and a sixfold cross-validation technique. 
  Results:  The average and standard deviation of training, validation, and testing loss functions among the six folds were 0.62 ± 0.09%, 1.04 ± 0.06%, and 1.44 ± 0.11%, respectively. Using CG and supervised DNN, we generated two sets of plans for each scenario in the test set. The proposed method took at most 1.5 s to select a set of five beam orientations and 300 s to calculate the dose influence matrices for 5 beams and finally 20 s to solve the fluence map optimization (FMO). However, CG needed around 15 h to calculate the dose influence matrices of all beams and at least 400 s to solve both the beam orientation selection and FMO problems. The differences in the dose coverage of PTV between plans generated by CG and by DNN were 0.2%. The average dose differences received by organs at risk were between 1 and 6 percent: Bladder had the smallest average difference in dose received (0.956 ± 1.184%), then Rectum (2.44 ± 2.11%), Left Femoral Head (6.03 ± 5.86%), and Right Femoral Head (5.885 ± 5.515%). The dose received by Body had an average difference of 0.10 ± 0.1% between the generated treatment plans. 
  Conclusions:  We developed a fast beam orientation selection method based on a DNN that selects beam orientations in seconds and is therefore suitable for clinical routines. In the training phase of the proposed method, the model learns the suitable beam orientations based on patients' anatomical features and omits time intensive calculations of dose influence matrices for all possible candidate beams. Solving the FMO to get the final treatment plan requires calculating dose influence matrices only for the selected beams.

10.1186/s41199-020-0047-y  |  Prognosis, Treatment, Genetics, Smart Healthcare  |  Prognosis, Treatment, Smart Healthcare, Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Review  |   For many years, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has been considered as a single entity. However, in the last decades HNSCC complexity and heterogeneity have been recognized. In parallel, high-throughput <i>omics</i> techniques had allowed picturing a larger spectrum of the behavior and characteristics of molecules in cancer and a large set of omics web-based tools and informative repository databases have been developed. The objective of the present review is to provide an overview on biological, prognostic and predictive molecular signatures in HNSCC. To contextualize the selected data, our literature survey includes a short summary of the main characteristics of omics data repositories and web-tools for data analyses. The timeframe of our analysis was fixed, encompassing papers published between January 2015 and January 2019. From more than 1000 papers evaluated, 61 omics studies were selected: 33 investigating mRNA signatures, 11 and 13 related to miRNA and other non-coding-RNA signatures and 4 analyzing DNA methylation signatures. More than half of identified signatures (36) had a prognostic value but only in 10 studies selection of a specific anatomical sub-site (8 oral cavity, 1 oropharynx and 1 both oral cavity and oropharynx) was performed. Noteworthy, although the sample size included in many studies was limited, about one-half of the retrieved studies reported an external validation on independent dataset(s), strengthening the relevance of the obtained data. Finally, we highlighted the development and exploitation of three gene-expression signatures, whose clinical impact on prognosis/prediction of treatment response could be high. Based on this overview on omics<i>-related</i> literature in HNSCC, we identified some limits and strengths. The major limits are represented by the low number of signatures associated to DNA methylation and to non-coding RNA (miRNA, lncRNA and piRNAs) and the availability of a single dataset with multiple omics on more than 500 HNSCC (i.e. TCGA). The major strengths rely on the integration of multiple datasets through meta-analysis approaches and on the growing integration among <i>omics</i> data obtained on the same cohort of patients. Moreover, new approaches based on artificial intelligence and informatic analyses are expected to be available in the next future.

10.3171/2020.1.FOCUS19914  |  Diagnosis, Treatment  |  Diagnosis, Treatment  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Objective:  The semiology of cingulate gyrus epilepsy is varied and may involve the paracentral area, the adjacent limbic system, and/or the orbitofrontal gyrus. Invasive electroencephalography (iEEG) recording is usually required for patients with deeply located epileptogenic foci. This paper reports on the authors' experiences in the diagnosis and surgical treatment of patients with focal epilepsy originating in the cingulate gyrus. 
  Methods:  Eighteen patients (median age 24 years, range 5-53 years) with a mean seizure history of 23 years (range 2-32 years) were analyzed retrospectively. The results of presurgical evaluation, surgical strategy, and postoperative pathology are reported, as well as follow-up concerning functional morbidity and seizures (median follow-up 7 years, range 2-12 years). 
  Results:  Patients with cingulate gyrus epilepsy presented with a variety of semiologies and scalp EEG patterns. Prior to ictal onset, 11 (61%) of the patients presented with aura. Initial ictal symptoms included limb posturing in 12 (67%), vocalization in 5, and hypermotor movement in 4. In most patients (n = 16, 89%), ictal EEG presented as widespread patterns with bilateral hemispheric origin, as well as muscle artifacts obscuring the onset of EEG during the ictal period in 11 patients. Among the 18 patients who underwent resection, the pathology revealed mild malformation of cortical development in 2, focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) Ib in 4, FCD IIa in 4, FCD IIb in 4, astrocytoma in 1, ganglioglioma in 1, and gliosis in 2. The seizure outcome after surgery was satisfactory: Engel class IA in 12 patients, IIB in 3, IIIA in 1, IIIB in 1, and IVB in 1 at the 2-year follow-up. 
  Conclusions:  In this study, the authors exploited the improved access to the cingulate epileptogenic network made possible by the use of 3D electrodes implanted using stereoelectroencephalography methodology. Under iEEG recording and intraoperative neuromonitoring, epilepsy surgery on lesions in the cingulate gyrus can result in good outcomes in terms of seizure recurrence and the incidence of postoperative permanent deficits.

  Methods:  The performance of eight deep learning models was validated using 3838 axial CT images from 698 consecutive patients with thyroid cancer who underwent preoperative CT imaging between January and August 2018 (3606 and 232 images from benign and malignant lymph nodes, respectively). Six trainees viewed the same patient images (n = 242), and their diagnostic performance and confidence level (5-point scale) were assessed before and after computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) was included. 
  Results:  The overall area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) of the eight deep learning algorithms was 0.846 (range 0.784-0.884). The best performing model was Xception, with an AUROC of 0.884. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of Xception were 82.8%, 80.2%, 83.0%, 83.0%, and 80.2%, respectively. After introducing the CAD system, underperforming trainees received more help from artificial intelligence than the higher performing trainees (p = 0.046), and overall confidence levels significantly increased from 3.90 to 4.30 (p &lt; 0.001). 
  Conclusion:  The deep learning-based CAD system used in this study for CT diagnosis of cervical LNM from thyroid cancer was clinically validated with an AUROC of 0.884. This approach may serve as a training tool to help resident physicians to gain confidence in diagnosis. 
  Key points:  • A deep learning-based CAD system for CT diagnosis of cervical LNM from thyroid cancer was validated using data from a clinical cohort. The AUROC for the eight tested algorithms ranged from 0.784 to 0.884. • Of the eight models, the Xception algorithm was the best performing model for the external validation dataset with 0.884 AUROC. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 82.8%, 80.2%, 83.0%, 83.0%, and 80.2%, respectively. • The CAD system exhibited potential to improve diagnostic specificity and accuracy in underperforming trainees (3 of 6 trainees, 50.0%). This approach may have clinical utility as a training tool to help trainees to gain confidence in diagnoses.

There is an unmet need to develop novel clinically relevant models of NSCLC to accelerate identification of drug targets and our understanding of the disease. 
  Experimental design:  Thirty surgically resected NSCLC primary patient tissue and 35 previously established patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models were processed for organoid culture establishment. Organoids were histologically and molecularly characterized by cytology and histology, exome sequencing, and RNA-sequencing analysis. Tumorigenicity was assessed through subcutaneous injection of organoids in NOD/SCID mice. Organoids were subjected to drug testing using EGFR, FGFR, and MEK-targeted therapies. 
  Results:  We have identified cell culture conditions favoring the establishment of short-term and long-term expansion of NSCLC organoids derived from primary lung patient and PDX tumor tissue. The NSCLC organoids recapitulated the histology of the patient and PDX tumor. They also retained tumorigenicity, as evidenced by cytologic features of malignancy, xenograft formation, preservation of mutations, copy number aberrations, and gene expression profiles between the organoid and matched parental tumor tissue by whole-exome and RNA sequencing. NSCLC organoid models also preserved the sensitivity of the matched parental tumor to targeted therapeutics, and could be used to validate or discover biomarker-drug combinations. 
  Conclusions:  Our panel of NSCLC organoids closely recapitulates the genomics and biology of patient tumors, and is a potential platform for drug testing and biomarker validation.

10.1186/s12859-020-3430-0  |  Diagnosis, Treatment, Genetics  |  Diagnosis, Treatment, Genetics  |  negative-binomial model  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq) is a popular sequencing method for studying RNA modifications and, in particular, for N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant RNA methylation modification found in various species. The detection of enriched regions is a main challenge of MeRIP-Seq analysis, however current tools either require a long time or do not fully utilize features of RNA sequencing such as strand information which could cause ambiguous calling. On the other hand, with more attention on the treatment experiments of MeRIP-Seq, biologists need intuitive evaluation on the treatment effect from comparison. Therefore, efficient and user-friendly software that can solve these tasks must be developed. 
  Results:  We developed a software named "model-based analysis and inference of MeRIP-Seq (MoAIMS)" to detect enriched regions of MeRIP-Seq and infer signal proportion based on a mixture negative-binomial model. MoAIMS is designed for transcriptome immunoprecipitation sequencing experiments; therefore, it is compatible with different RNA sequencing protocols. MoAIMS offers excellent processing speed and competitive performance when compared with other tools. When MoAIMS is applied to studies of m6A, the detected enriched regions contain known biological features of m6A. Furthermore, signal proportion inferred from MoAIMS for m6A treatment datasets (perturbation of m6A methyltransferases) showed a decreasing trend that is consistent with experimental observations, suggesting that the signal proportion can be used as an intuitive indicator of treatment effect. 
  Conclusions:  MoAIMS is efficient and easy-to-use software implemented in R. MoAIMS can not only detect enriched regions of MeRIP-Seq efficiently but also provide intuitive evaluation on treatment effect for MeRIP-Seq treatment datasets.

10.1016/j.healthplace.2019.102243  |  Epidemiology  |  Epidemiology  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Spatial lifecourse epidemiology is an interdisciplinary field that utilizes advanced spatial, location-based, and artificial intelligence technologies to investigate the long-term effects of environmental, behavioural, psychosocial, and biological factors on health-related states and events and the underlying mechanisms. With the growing number of studies reporting findings from this field and the critical need for public health and policy decisions to be based on the strongest science possible, transparency and clarity in reporting in spatial lifecourse epidemiologic studies is essential. A task force supported by the International Initiative on Spatial Lifecourse Epidemiology (ISLE) identified a need for guidance in this area and developed a Spatial Lifecourse Epidemiology Reporting Standards (ISLE-ReSt) Statement. The aim is to provide a checklist of recommendations to improve and make more consistent reporting of spatial lifecourse epidemiologic studies. The STrengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement for cohort studies was identified as an appropriate starting point to provide initial items to consider for inclusion. Reporting standards for spatial data and methods were then integrated to form a single comprehensive checklist of reporting recommendations. The strength of our approach has been our international and multidisciplinary team of content experts and contributors who represent a wide range of relevant scientific conventions, and our adherence to international norms for the development of reporting guidelines. As spatial, location-based, and artificial intelligence technologies used in spatial lifecourse epidemiology continue to evolve at a rapid pace, it will be necessary to revisit and adapt the ISLE-ReSt at least every 2-3 years from its release.

We present a method that uses machine learning techniques to choose optimal interventions from a set of possible interventions within a case study aiming to increase General Practitioner (GP) discussions of physical activity (PA) with their patients. Interventions were developed based on a causal loop diagram with 26 GPs across 13 clinics in Geelong, Australia. GPs prioritised eight from more than 80 potential interventions to increase GP discussion of PA with patients. Following a 2-week baseline, a multi-arm bandit algorithm was used to assign optimal strategies to GP clinics with the target outcome being GP PA discussion rates. The algorithm was updated weekly and the process iterated until the more promising strategies emerged (a duration of seven weeks). The top three performing strategies were continued for 3 weeks to improve the power of the hypothesis test of effectiveness for each strategy compared to baseline. GPs recorded a total of 11,176 conversations about PA. GPs identified 15 factors affecting GP PA discussion rates with patients including GP skills and awareness, fragmentation of care and fear of adverse outcomes. The two most effective strategies were correctly identified within seven weeks of the algorithm-based assignment of strategies. These were clinic reception staff providing PA information to patients at check in and PA screening questionnaires completed in the waiting room. This study demonstrates an efficient way to test and identify optimal strategies from multiple possible solutions.

  Assessment:  Each volunteer was scanned in two separate sessions. T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> * maps were acquired repeatedly covering the hepatic portal vein (HPV) and vena cava inferior (VCI, control vein) before and after intake of oxygenated or control water. Assessments were done by placing a region of interest in the HPV and VCI. 
  Statistical test:  A mixed linear model was performed to the compare control vs. oxygen group. 
  Results:  Drinking caused a mean 1.6% 95% CI (1.1-2.0% P &lt; 0.001) increase in T<sub>1</sub> of HPV blood and water oxygenation attributed another 0.70% 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.07-1.3% P = 0.028) increase. Oxygenation did not change T<sub>1</sub> in VCI blood. Mean T<sub>2</sub> * increased 9.6% 95% CI (1.7-17.5% P = 0.017) after ingestion of oxygenated water and 1.2% 95% CI (-4.3-6.8% P = 0.661) after ingestion of control water. The corresponding changes in VCI blood were not significant. 
  Data conclusion:  Ingestion of water caused changes in T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> * of HPV blood compatible with dilution due to water absorption. The effects were enhanced by oxygen. Assessment of oxygen enrichment of HPV blood was not possible due to the dilution effect.

10.2196/17125  |  Diagnosis, Epidemiology, Smart Healthcare  |  Prognosis, Epidemiology, Smart Healthcare  |  Deep Neural Network  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Coding of underlying causes of death from death certificates is a process that is nowadays undertaken mostly by humans with potential assistance from expert systems, such as the Iris software. It is, consequently, an expensive process that can, in addition, suffer from geospatial discrepancies, thus severely impairing the comparability of death statistics at the international level. The recent advances in artificial intelligence, specifically the rise of deep learning methods, has enabled computers to make efficient decisions on a number of complex problems that were typically considered out of reach without human assistance; they require a considerable amount of data to learn from, which is typically their main limiting factor. However, the CépiDc (Centre d'épidémiologie sur les causes médicales de Décès) stores an exhaustive database of death certificates at the French national scale, amounting to several millions of training examples available for the machine learning practitioner. 
  Objective:  This article investigates the application of deep neural network methods to coding underlying causes of death. 
  Methods:  The investigated dataset was based on data contained from every French death certificate from 2000 to 2015, containing information such as the subject's age and gender, as well as the chain of events leading to his or her death, for a total of around 8 million observations. The task of automatically coding the subject's underlying cause of death was then formulated as a predictive modelling problem. A deep neural network-based model was then designed and fit to the dataset. Its error rate was then assessed on an exterior test dataset and compared to the current state-of-the-art (ie, the Iris software). Statistical significance of the proposed approach's superiority was assessed via bootstrap. 
  Results:  The proposed approach resulted in a test accuracy of 97.8% (95% CI 97.7-97.9), which constitutes a significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art and its accuracy of 74.5% (95% CI 74.0-75.0) assessed on the same test example. Such an improvement opens up a whole field of new applications, from nosologist-level batch-automated coding to international and temporal harmonization of cause of death statistics. A typical example of such an application is demonstrated by recoding French overdose-related deaths from 2000 to 2010. 
  Conclusions:  This article shows that deep artificial neural networks are perfectly suited to the analysis of electronic health records and can learn a complex set of medical rules directly from voluminous datasets, without any explicit prior knowledge. Although not entirely free from mistakes, the derived algorithm constitutes a powerful decision-making tool that is able to handle structured medical data with an unprecedented performance. We strongly believe that the methods developed in this article are highly reusable in a variety of settings related to epidemiology, biostatistics, and the medical sciences in general.

10.1002/mp.14129  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Purpose:  Image-based breast lesion detection is a powerful clinical diagnosis technology. In recent years, deep learning architectures have achieved considerable success in medical image analysis however, they always require large-scale samples. In mammography images, breast lesions are inconspicuous, multiscale, and have blurred edges. Moreover, few well-labeled images exist. Because of these factors, the detection accuracy of conventional deep learning methods is low. Therefore, we attempted to improve the accuracy of mammary lesion detection by introducing transfer learning (TL) into a deep learning framework for the few-shot learning task and thus provide a method that will further assist physicians in detecting breast lesions. 
  Methods:  In this paper, we propose a method called "few-shot learning with deformable convolution for multiscale lesion detection in mammography," named FDMNet. Deformable convolution is introduced for enhancing the network's ability to detect lesions, and the sensitivity of the multiscale feature space is reinforced by using a feature pyramid method. Furthermore, by introducing location information in the predictor, the sensitivity of the model to lesion location is also enhanced. The proposed method, through the TL technique that is applied mines the potentially common knowledge of features in the source domain and transfers it into the target domain to improve the accuracy of breast lesion detection in the few-shot learning task. 
  Results:  On the publicly available datasets for screening mammography CBIS-DDSM and Mini-MIAS, the proposed method performs better than five widely used detection methods. On the CBIS-DDSM dataset, its comprehensive scores, sensitivity, precision, and the mean dice similarity coefficient are 0.911, 0.949, 0.873, and 0.913, respectively, and on the Mini-MIAS dataset, these values are 0.931, 0.966, 0.882, and 0.941, respectively. 
  Conclusions:  To achieve the few-shot learning required for medical image analysis, the proposed method uses TL to execute feature knowledge transformation and includes deformable convolution to build a feature pyramid structure, which enhances the learning performance of the network for lesions. The results of comparative numerical experiments show that the proposed method outperforms some state-of-the-art methods.

10.20900/jpbs.20200001  |  Treatment, Smart Healthcare  |  Treatment, Smart Healthcare  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Review  |    Background:  The majority of individuals with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) do not receive any formal substance use treatment. Due to limited engagement and access to traditional treatment, there is increasing evidence that patients with OUDs turn to online social platforms to access peer support and obtain health-related information about addiction and recovery. Interacting with peers before and during recovery is a key component of many evidence-based addiction recovery programs, and may improve self-efficacy and treatment engagement as well as reduce relapse. Commonly-used online social platforms are limited in utility and scalability as an adjunct to addiction treatment; lack effective content moderation (e.g., misinformed advice, maliciousness or "trolling"); and lack common security and ethical safeguards inherent to clinical care. 
  Methods:  This present study will develop a novel, artificial-intelligence (AI) enabled, mobile treatment delivery method that fulfills the need for a robust, secure, technology-based peer support platform to support patients with OUD. Forty adults receiving outpatient buprenorphine treatment for OUD will be asked to pilot a smartphone-based mobile peer support application, the "Marigold App", for a duration of six weeks. The program will use (1) a prospective cohort study to obtain text message content and feasibility metrics, and (2) qualitative interviews to evaluate usability and acceptability of the mobile platform. 
  Anticipated findings and future directions:  The Marigold mobile platform will allow patients to access a tailored chat support group 24/7 as a complement to different forms of clinical OUD treatment. Marigold can keep groups safe and constructive by augmenting chats with AI tools capable of understanding the emotional sentiment in messages, automatically "flagging" critical or clinically relevant content. This project will demonstrate the robustness of these AI tools by adapting them to catch OUD-specific "flags" in peer messages while also examining the adoptability of the platform itself within OUD patients.

10.2196/15963  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis  |  CNN (BMSNet)  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy remain the gold standard for the diagnosis of hematological diseases despite the development of flow cytometry (FCM) and molecular and gene analyses. However, the interpretation of the results is laborious and operator dependent. Furthermore, the obtained results exhibit inter- and intravariations among specialists. Therefore, it is important to develop a more objective and automated analysis system. Several deep learning models have been developed and applied in medical image analysis but not in the field of hematological histology, especially for bone marrow smear applications. 
  Objective:  The aim of this study was to develop a deep learning model (BMSNet) for assisting hematologists in the interpretation of bone marrow smears for faster diagnosis and disease monitoring. 
  Methods:  From January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018, 122 bone marrow smears were photographed and divided into a development cohort (N=42), a validation cohort (N=70), and a competition cohort (N=10). The development cohort included 17,319 annotated cells from 291 high-resolution photos. In total, 20 photos were taken for each patient in the validation cohort and the competition cohort. This study included eight annotation categories: erythroid, blasts, myeloid, lymphoid, plasma cells, monocyte, megakaryocyte, and unable to identify. BMSNet is a convolutional neural network with the YOLO v3 architecture, which detects and classifies single cells in a single model. Six visiting staff members participated in a human-machine competition, and the results from the FCM were regarded as the ground truth. 
  Results:  In the development cohort, according to 6-fold cross-validation, the average precision of the bounding box prediction without consideration of the classification is 67.4%. After removing the bounding box prediction error, the precision and recall of BMSNet were similar to those of the hematologists in most categories. In detecting more than 5% of blasts in the validation cohort, the area under the curve (AUC) of BMSNet (0.948) was higher than the AUC of the hematologists (0.929) but lower than the AUC of the pathologists (0.985). In detecting more than 20% of blasts, the AUCs of the hematologists (0.981) and pathologists (0.980) were similar and were higher than the AUC of BMSNet (0.942). Further analysis showed that the performance difference could be attributed to the myelodysplastic syndrome cases. In the competition cohort, the mean value of the correlations between BMSNet and FCM was 0.960, and the mean values of the correlations between the visiting staff and FCM ranged between 0.952 and 0.990. 
  Conclusions:  Our deep learning model can assist hematologists in interpreting bone marrow smears by facilitating and accelerating the detection of hematopoietic cells. However, a detailed morphological interpretation still requires trained hematologists.

With a mean number of 50,000 SB frames per video, SBCE reading is time-consuming and tedious (30 to 60 minutes per video). We describe a large, multicenter database named CAD-CAP (Computer-Assisted Diagnosis for CAPsule Endoscopy, CAD-CAP). This database aims to serve the development of CAD tools for CE reading. <b>Materials and methods</b> Twelve French endoscopy centers were involved. All available third-generation SB-CE videos (Pillcam, Medtronic) were retrospectively selected from these centers and deidentified. Any pathological frame was extracted and included in the database. Manual segmentation of findings within these frames was performed by two pre-med students trained and supervised by an expert reader. All frames were then classified by type and clinical relevance by a panel of three expert readers. An automated extraction process was also developed to create a dataset of normal, proofread, control images from normal, complete, SB-CE videos. <b>Results</b> Four-thousand-one-hundred-and-seventy-four SB-CE were included. Of them, 1,480 videos (35 %) containing at least one pathological finding were selected. Findings from 5,184 frames (with their short video sequences) were extracted and delimited: 718 frames with fresh blood, 3,097 frames with vascular lesions, and 1,369 frames with inflammatory and ulcerative lesions. Twenty-thousand normal frames were extracted from 206 SB-CE normal videos. CAD-CAP has already been used for development of automated tools for angiectasia detection and also for two international challenges on medical computerized analysis.

10.3389/fonc.2020.00093  |  Diagnosis, Treatment  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Treatment  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Research  |   <b>Background:</b> Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is commonly utilized in preoperative treatment for local breast cancer, and it gives high clinical response rates and can result in pathologic complete response (pCR) in 6-25% of patients. In recent years, dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) has been increasingly used to assess the pathological response of breast cancer to NAC. In present analysis, we assess the diagnostic performance of DCE-MRI in evaluating the pathological response of breast cancer to NAC. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> A systematic search in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for original studies was performed. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Patient, study, and imaging characteristics were extracted, and sufficient data to reconstruct 2 × 2 tables were obtained. Data pooling, heterogeneity testing, forest plot construction, meta-regression analysis and sensitivity analysis were performed using Stata version 12.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). <b>Results:</b> Eighteen studies (969 patients with breast cancer) were included in the present meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of DCE-MRI were 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.70, 0.88) and 0.84 (95% [CI]: 0.79, 0.88), respectively. Meta-regression analysis found no significant factors affecting heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis showed that studies that set pathological complete response (pCR) (<i>n</i> = 14) as a responder showed a tendency for higher sensitivity compared with those that set pCR and near pCR together (<i>n</i> = 5) as a responder (0.83 vs. 0.72), and studies (<i>n</i> = 14) that used DCE-MRI to early predict the pathological response of breast cancer had a higher sensitivity (0.83 vs. 0.71) and equivalent specificity (0.80 vs. 0.86) compared to studies (<i>n</i> = 5) that assessed the response after NAC completion. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results indicated that DCE-MRI could be considered an important auxiliary method for evaluating the pathological response of breast cancer to NAC and used as an effective method for dynamically monitoring the efficacy during NAC. DCE-MRI also performed well in predicting the pCR of breast cancer to NAC. However, due to the heterogeneity of the included studies, caution should be exercised in applying our results.

10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.0265  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Importance:  Mammography screening currently relies on subjective human interpretation. Artificial intelligence (AI) advances could be used to increase mammography screening accuracy by reducing missed cancers and false positives. 
  Objective:  To evaluate whether AI can overcome human mammography interpretation limitations with a rigorous, unbiased evaluation of machine learning algorithms. 
  Design, setting, and participants:  In this diagnostic accuracy study conducted between September 2016 and November 2017, an international, crowdsourced challenge was hosted to foster AI algorithm development focused on interpreting screening mammography. More than 1100 participants comprising 126 teams from 44 countries participated. Analysis began November 18, 2016. 
  Main outcomes and measurements:  Algorithms used images alone (challenge 1) or combined images, previous examinations (if available), and clinical and demographic risk factor data (challenge 2) and output a score that translated to cancer yes/no within 12 months. Algorithm accuracy for breast cancer detection was evaluated using area under the curve and algorithm specificity compared with radiologists' specificity with radiologists' sensitivity set at 85.9% (United States) and 83.9% (Sweden). An ensemble method aggregating top-performing AI algorithms and radiologists' recall assessment was developed and evaluated. 
  Results:  Overall, 144 231 screening mammograms from 85 580 US women (952 cancer positive ≤12 months from screening) were used for algorithm training and validation. A second independent validation cohort included 166 578 examinations from 68 008 Swedish women (780 cancer positive). The top-performing algorithm achieved an area under the curve of 0.858 (United States) and 0.903 (Sweden) and 66.2% (United States) and 81.2% (Sweden) specificity at the radiologists' sensitivity, lower than community-practice radiologists' specificity of 90.5% (United States) and 98.5% (Sweden). Combining top-performing algorithms and US radiologist assessments resulted in a higher area under the curve of 0.942 and achieved a significantly improved specificity (92.0%) at the same sensitivity. 
  Conclusions and relevance:  While no single AI algorithm outperformed radiologists, an ensemble of AI algorithms combined with radiologist assessment in a single-reader screening environment improved overall accuracy. This study underscores the potential of using machine learning methods for enhancing mammography screening interpretation.

10.1007/s00330-020-06856-z  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Treatment  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Treatment  |  deep learning-based algorithm  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Objectives:  To develop and evaluate the performance of a deep learning-based system for automatic patellar height measurements using knee radiographs. 
  Methods:  The deep learning-based algorithm was developed with a data set consisting of 1018 left knee radiographs for the prediction of patellar height parameters, specifically the Insall-Salvati index (ISI), Caton-Deschamps index (CDI), modified Caton-Deschamps index (MCDI), and Keerati index (KI). The performance and generalizability of the algorithm were tested with 200 left knee and 200 right knee radiographs, respectively. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), Pearson correlation coefficient, mean absolute difference (MAD), root mean square (RMS), and Bland-Altman plots for predictions by the system were evaluated in comparison with manual measurements as the reference standard. 
  Results:  Compared with the reference standard, the deep learning-based algorithm showed high accuracy in predicting the ISI, CDI, and KI (left knee ICC = 0.91-0.95, r = 0.84-0.91, MAD = 0.02-0.05, RMS = 0.02-0.07; right knee ICC = 0.87-0.96, r = 0.78-0.92, MAD = 0.02-0.06, RMS = 0.02-0.10), but not the MCDI (left knee ICC = 0.65, r = 0.50, MAD = 0.14, RMS = 0.18; right knee ICC = 0.62, r = 0.47, MAD = 0.15, RMS = 0.20). The performance of the algorithm met or exceeded that of manual determination of ISI, CDI, and KI by radiologists. 
  Conclusions:  In its current state, the developed system can predict the ISI, CDI, and KI for both left and right knee radiographs as accurately as radiologists. Training the system further with more data would increase its utility in helping radiologists measure patellar height in clinical practice. 
  Key points:  • Objective and reliable measurement of patellar height parameters is important for clinical diagnosis and the development of a treatment strategy. • Deep learning can be used to create an automatic patellar height measurement system based on knee radiographs. • The deep learning-based patellar height measurement system achieves comparable performance to radiologists in measuring ISI, CDI, and KI.

Our study aimed to build a radiomic prediction model for LGG-related epilepsy type based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 205 cases with LGG-related epilepsy were enrolled in the retrospective study and divided into training and validation cohorts (1:1) according to their surgery time. Seven hundred thirty-four radiomic features were extracted from T2-weighted imaging, including six location features. Pearson correlation coefficient, univariate area under curve (AUC) analysis, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression were adopted to select the most relevant features for the epilepsy type to build a radiomic signature. Furthermore, a novel radiomic nomogram was developed for clinical application using the radiomic signature and clinical variables from all patients. <b>Results:</b> Four MRI-based features were selected from the 734 radiomic features, including one location feature. Good discriminative performances were achieved in both training (AUC = 0.859, 95% CI = 0.787-0.932) and validation cohorts (AUC = 0.839, 95% CI = 0.761-0.917) for the type of epilepsy. The accuracies were 80.4 and 80.6%, respectively. The radiomic nomogram also allowed for a high degree of discrimination. All models presented favorable calibration curves and decision curve analyses. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results suggested that the MRI-based radiomic analysis may predict the type of LGG-related epilepsy to enable individualized therapy for patients with LGG-related epilepsy.

The default mode network (DMN) is a large-scale brain network of interacting brain regions involved in attention, working memory and executive function. The role of DMN white matter integrity in cognitive deficits of VCIND patients is unclear. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), this study was carried out to investigate white matter microstructural changes in the DMN in VCIND patients and their contributions to cognitive deficits. Thirty-one patients with subcortical VCIND and twenty-two healthy elderly subjects were recruited. All patients underwent neuropsychological assessments and DTI examination. Voxel-based analyses were performed to extract fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) measures in the DMN. Compared with the healthy elderly subjects, patients diagnosed with subcortical VCIND presented with abnormal white matter integrity in several key hubs of the DMN. The severity of damage in the white matter microstructure in the DMN significantly correlated with cognitive dysfunction. Mediation analyses demonstrated that DTI values could account for attention, executive and language impairments, and partly mediated global cognitive dysfunction in the subcortical VCIND patients. DMN integrity is significantly impaired in subcortical VCIND patients. The disrupted DMN connectivity could explain the attention, language and executive dysfunction, which indicates that the white matter integrity of the DMN may be a neuroimaging marker for VCIND.

Here, we use mobile-phone-data-based counts of 11,478,484 people egressing or transiting through the prefecture of Wuhan between 1 January and 24 January 2020 as they moved to 296 prefectures throughout China. First, we document the efficacy of quarantine in ceasing movement. Second, we show that the distribution of population outflow from Wuhan accurately predicts the relative frequency and geographic distribution of COVID-19 infections through February 19, 2020, across all of China. Third, we develop a spatio-temporal "risk source" model that leverages population flow data (which operationalizes risk emanating from epidemic epicenters) to not only forecast confirmed cases, but also to identify high-transmission-risk locales at an early stage. Fourth, we use this risk source model to statistically derive the geographic spread of COVID-19 and the growth pattern based on the population outflow from Wuhan; the model yields a benchmark trend and an index for assessing COVID-19 community transmission risk over time for different locations. This approach can be used by policy-makers in any nation with available data to make rapid and accurate risk assessments and to plan allocation of limited resources ahead of ongoing outbreaks.

The neural mechanisms of spoken word segmentation for English as a second language (ESL) learners remain elusive. The present study, using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), addresses this issue by measuring hemodynamic responses in the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in a word-spotting task, designed with two task conditions (easy vs. difficult). Thirty participants, divided into a high listening proficiency group (HLG) and a low listening proficiency group (LLG), were tested. Results revealed significantly less TPJ activation in the HLG than in the LLG. Further analyses supported this result by showing that activation in the TPJ was in a negative correlation with listening proficiency. This association appears to be related to the more efficient use of processing resources in a bottom-up fashion for accurate and efficient sensory representations in high proficient language learners. In contrast, cortical activation in the PFC increased with listening proficiency and was stronger in the difficult task condition than in the easy task condition, implying that recruitment of top-down cognitive control functions might play a role in word segmentation. Our results suggest that the combination of the functions mediated via bottom-up sensory input processing (demonstrated in the TPJ activation) and top-down cognitive processing (demonstrated in the PFC activation) are crucial for ESL listeners' spoken word segmentation.

10.1186/s12864-020-6542-z  |  Genetics  |  Genetics  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Read coverage of RNA sequencing data reflects gene expression and RNA processing events. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods, particularly "full-length" ones, provide read coverage of many individual cells and have the potential to reveal cellular heterogeneity in RNA transcription and processing. However, visualization tools suited to highlighting cell-to-cell heterogeneity in read coverage are still lacking. 
  Results:  Here, we have developed Millefy, a tool for visualizing read coverage of scRNA-seq data in genomic contexts. Millefy is designed to show read coverage of all individual cells at once in genomic contexts and to highlight cell-to-cell heterogeneity in read coverage. By visualizing read coverage of all cells as a heat map and dynamically reordering cells based on diffusion maps, Millefy facilitates discovery of "local" region-specific, cell-to-cell heterogeneity in read coverage. We applied Millefy to scRNA-seq data sets of mouse embryonic stem cells and triple-negative breast cancers and showed variability of transcribed regions including antisense RNAs, 3 <sup>'</sup> UTR lengths, and enhancer RNA transcription. 
  Conclusions:  Millefy simplifies the examination of cellular heterogeneity in RNA transcription and processing events using scRNA-seq data. Millefy is available as an R package (https://github.com/yuifu/millefy) and as a Docker image for use with Jupyter Notebook (https://hub.docker.com/r/yuifu/datascience-notebook-millefy).

Here, a new bio-exploration concept design for Enceladus' exo-ocean is proposed, focusing on the potential presence of organisms across a wide range of sizes (<i>i.e.,</i> from uni- to multicellular and animal-like), according to state-of-the-art sensor and robotic platform technologies used in terrestrial deep-sea research. In particular, we focus on combined direct and indirect life-detection capabilities, based on optoacoustic imaging and passive acoustics, as well as molecular approaches. Such biologically oriented sampling can be accompanied by concomitant geochemical and oceanographic measurements to provide data relevant to exo-ocean exploration and understanding. Finally, we describe how this multidisciplinary monitoring approach is currently enabled in terrestrial oceans through cabled (fixed) observatories and their related mobile multiparametric platforms (<i>i.e.,</i> Autonomous Underwater and Remotely Operated Vehicles, as well as crawlers, rovers, and biomimetic robots) and how their modified design can be used for exo-ocean exploration.

10.2196/15411  |  Prognosis  |  Prognosis  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction are placental dysfunction-related disorders (PDDs) that require a referral decision be made within a certain time period. An appropriate prediction model should be developed for these diseases. However, previous models did not demonstrate robust performances and/or they were developed from datasets with highly imbalanced classes. 
  Objective:  In this study, we developed a predictive model of PDDs by machine learning that uses features at 24-37 weeks' gestation, including maternal characteristics, uterine artery (UtA) Doppler measures, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-1 (sFlt-1), and placental growth factor (PlGF). 
  Methods:  A public dataset was taken from a prospective cohort study that included pregnant women with PDDs (66/95, 69%) and a control group (29/95, 31%). Preliminary selection of features was based on a statistical analysis using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute). We used Weka (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) 3.8.3 (The University of Waikato, Hamilton, NZ) to automatically select the best model using its optimization algorithm. We also manually selected the best of 23 white-box models. Models, including those from recent studies, were also compared by interval estimation of evaluation metrics. We used the Matthew correlation coefficient (MCC) as the main metric. It is not overoptimistic to evaluate the performance of a prediction model developed from a dataset with a class imbalance. Repeated 10-fold cross-validation was applied. 
  Results:  The classification via regression model was chosen as the best model. Our model had a robust MCC (.93, 95% CI .87-1.00, vs .64, 95% CI .57-.71) and specificity (100%, 95% CI 100-100, vs 90%, 95% CI 90-90) compared to each metric of the best models from recent studies. The sensitivity of this model was not inferior (95%, 95% CI 91-100, vs 100%, 95% CI 92-100). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was also competitive (0.970, 95% CI 0.966-0.974, vs 0.987, 95% CI 0.980-0.994). Features in the best model were maternal weight, BMI, pulsatility index of the UtA, sFlt-1, and PlGF. The most important feature was the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio. This model used an M5P algorithm consisting of a decision tree and four linear models with different thresholds. Our study was also better than the best ones among recent studies in terms of the class balance and the size of the case class (66/95, 69%, vs 27/239, 11.3%). 
  Conclusions:  Our model had a robust predictive performance. It was also developed to deal with the problem of a class imbalance. In the context of clinical management, this model may improve maternal mortality and neonatal morbidity and reduce health care costs.

10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.107716  |  Other  |  None, Other  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Data from controlled laboratory experiments in adults indicate that the subjective effects of cannabis vary by administration method (e.g., combustible, vaporized). Whether the subjective effects of cannabis experienced in the natural ecology and among adolescents differ by cannabis administration method is unknown. In this observational study, adolescents' retrospective reports of subjective effects after combustible, edible, and vaporized cannabis use were examined. 
  Methods:  Students from ten public schools in Los Angeles, CA, USA (M[SD] age = 16.1 [.43] years) who reported past 6-month use of combustible, edible, or vaporized cannabis (N = 584) were surveyed on subjective effects experienced after use (yes/no). They were provided with a 12 item self-report checklist of six positive (e.g., relaxed, energetic) and six negative (e.g., drowsy, lazy) subjective effects. For each method of administration, affirmative responses were summed in positive (range: 0-6) and negative (range: 0-6) effect composite scores. 
  Results:  Generalized estimating equations adjusted for demographics and recent cannabis use revealed a graded pattern of differences in positive subjective effects across products, with highest scores for combustible (M[SD] = 3.98[1.76]), followed by edible (M[SD] = 3.58 [2.04]) and vaporized (M[SD] = 3.11 [2.21]) cannabis (all pairwise cross-product contrasts p &lt; .01). Mean negative effect score was highest for edible (M[SD] = 2.27 [1.95]), followed by combustible (M[SD] = 1.94 [1.66]), and vaporized (M[SD] = 1.34 [1.73]) cannabis, respectively (all pairwise contrasts p &lt; .02). 
  Conclusion:  Adolescents' reports of subjective effects varied across cannabis administration methods. Combustible cannabis' more desirable subjective effects profile might be indicative of higher abuse liability.

10.3390/s20092489  |  None  |  Diagnosis  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Under the conditions of low flow rate and strong noise, the current electromagnetic flowmeter (EMF) cannot satisfy the requirement for measurement or separate the actual flow signal and interference signal accurately. Correlation detection technology can reduce the bandwidth and suppress noise effectively using the periodic transmission of signal and noise randomness. As for the problem that the current anti-interference technology cannot suppress noise effectively, the noise and interference of the electromagnetic flowmeter were analyzed in this paper, and a design of the electromagnetic flowmeter based on differential correlation detection was proposed. Then, in order to verify the feasibility of the electromagnetic flow measurement system based on differential correlation, an experimental platform for the comparison between standard flow and measured flow was established and a verification experiment was carried out under special conditions and with flow calibration measurements. Finally, the data obtained in the experiment were analyzed. The research result showed that an electromagnetic flowmeter based on differential correlation detection satisfies the need for measurement completely. The lower limit of the flow rate of the electromagnetic flowmeter based on the differential correlation principle could reach 0.084 m/s. Under strong external interferences, the electromagnetic flowmeter based on differential correlation had a fluctuation range in output value of only 10 mV. This shows that the electromagnetic flowmeter based on the differential correlation principle has unique advantages in measurements taken under the conditions of strong noise, slurry flow, and low flow rate.

10.1002/ece3.6147  |  None  |  Diagnosis  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Ecological camera traps are increasingly used by wildlife biologists to unobtrusively monitor an ecosystems animal population. However, manual inspection of the images produced is expensive, laborious, and time-consuming. The success of deep learning systems using camera trap images has been previously explored in preliminary stages. These studies, however, are lacking in their practicality. They are primarily focused on extremely large datasets, often millions of images, and there is little to no focus on performance when tasked with species identification in new locations not seen during training. Our goal was to test the capabilities of deep learning systems trained on camera trap images using modestly sized training data, compare performance when considering unseen background locations, and quantify the gradient of lower bound performance to provide a guideline of data requirements in correspondence to performance expectations. We use a dataset provided by Parks Canada containing 47,279 images collected from 36 unique geographic locations across multiple environments. Images represent 55 animal species and human activity with high-class imbalance. We trained, tested, and compared the capabilities of six deep learning computer vision networks using transfer learning and image augmentation: DenseNet201, Inception-ResNet-V3, InceptionV3, NASNetMobile, MobileNetV2, and Xception. We compare overall performance on "trained" locations where DenseNet201 performed best with 95.6% top-1 accuracy showing promise for deep learning methods for smaller scale research efforts. Using trained locations, classifications with &lt;500 images had low and highly variable recall of 0.750 ± 0.329, while classifications with over 1,000 images had a high and stable recall of 0.971 ± 0.0137. Models tasked with classifying species from untrained locations were less accurate, with DenseNet201 performing best with 68.7% top-1 accuracy. Finally, we provide an open repository where ecologists can insert their image data to train and test custom species detection models for their desired ecological domain.

10.1016/j.cmpb.2019.105162  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis  |  Deep Convolutional Neural Networks  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background and objective:  In most patients presenting with respiratory symptoms, the findings of chest radiography play a key role in the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of the disease. Consolidation is a common term in radiology, which indicates focally increased lung density. When the alveolar structures become filled with pus, fluid, blood cells or protein subsequent to a pulmonary pathological process, it may result in different types of lung opacity in chest radiograph. This study aims at detecting consolidations in chest x-ray radiographs, with a certain precision, using artificial intelligence and especially Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to assist radiologist for better diagnosis. 
  Methods:  Medical image datasets usually are relatively small to be used for training a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), so transfer learning technique with well-known DCNNs pre-trained with ImageNet dataset are used to improve the accuracy of the models. ImageNet feature space is different from medical images and in the other side, the well-known DCNNs are designed to achieve the best performance on ImageNet. Therefore, they cannot show their best performance on medical images. To overcome this problem, we designed a problem-based architecture which preserves the information of images for detecting consolidation in Pediatric Chest X-ray dataset. We proposed a three-step pre-processing approach to enhance generalization of the models. To demonstrate the correctness of numerical results, an occlusion test is applied to visualize outputs of the model and localize the detected appropriate area. A different dataset as an extra validation is used in order to investigate the generalization of the proposed model. 
  Results:  The best accuracy to detect consolidation is 94.67% obtained by our problem based architecture for the understudy dataset which outperforms the previous works and the other architectures. 
  Conclusions:  The designed models can be employed as computer aided diagnosis tools in real practice. We critically discussed the datasets and the previous works based on them and show that without some considerations the results of them may be misleading. We believe, the output of AI should be only interpreted as focal consolidation. The clinical significance of the finding can not be interpreted without integration of clinical data.

10.1111/den.13688  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis  |  CNN  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Objectives:  Detecting early gastric cancer is difficult, and it may even be overlooked by experienced endoscopists. Recently, artificial intelligence based on deep learning through convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has enabled significant advancements in the field of gastroenterology. However, it remains unclear whether a CNN can outperform endoscopists. In this study, we evaluated whether the performance of a CNN in detecting early gastric cancer is better than that of endoscopists. 
  Methods:  The CNN was constructed using 13,584 endoscopic images from 2,639 lesions of gastric cancer. Subsequently, its diagnostic ability was compared to that of 67 endoscopists using an independent test dataset (2,940 images from 140 cases). 
  Results:  The average diagnostic time for analyzing 2,940 test endoscopic images by the CNN and endoscopists were 45.5 ± 1.8 s and 173.0 ± 66.0 min, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for the CNN were 58.4%, 87.3%, 26.0%, and 96.5%, respectively. These values for the 67 endoscopists were 31.9%, 97.2%, 46.2%, and 94.9%, respectively. The CNN had a significantly higher sensitivity than the endoscopists (by 26.5%; 95% confidence interval, 14.9-32.5%). 
  Conclusion:  The CNN detected more early gastric cancer cases in a shorter time than the endoscopists. The CNN needs further training to achieve higher diagnostic accuracy. However, a diagnostic support tool for gastric cancer using a CNN will be realized in the near future.

10.3390/s20010293  |  Smart Healthcare  |  Treatment, Smart Healthcare  |  BIM models  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   To generate indoor as-built building information models (AB BIMs) automatically and economically is a great technological challenge. Many approaches have been developed to address this problem in recent years, but it is far from being settled, particularly for the point cloud segmentation and the extraction of the relationship among different elements due to the complicated indoor environment. This is even more difficult for the low-quality point cloud generated by low-cost scanning equipment. This paper proposes an automatic as-built BIMs generation framework that transforms the noisy 3D point cloud produced by a low-cost RGB-D sensor (about 708 USD for data collection equipment, 379 USD for the Structure sensor and 329 USD for iPad) to the as-built BIMs, without any manual intervention. The experiment results show that the proposed method has competitive robustness and accuracy, compared to the high-quality Terrestrial Lidar System (TLS), with the element extraction accuracy of 100%, mean dimension reconstruction accuracy of 98.6% and mean area reconstruction accuracy of 93.6%. Also, the proposed framework makes the BIM generation workflows more efficient in both data collection and data processing. In the experiments, the time consumption of data collection for a typical room, with an area of 45-67 m 2 , is reduced to 4-6 min with an RGB-D sensor from 50-60 min with TLS. The processing time to generate BIM models is about half minutes automatically, from around 10 min with a conventional semi-manual method.

10.1097/MLR.0000000000001221  |  Treatment  |  Diagnosis, Treatment  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Objective:  Experts cautioned that patients affected by the November 2010 withdrawal of the opioid analgesic propoxyphene might receive riskier prescriptions. To explore this, we compared drug receipts and outcomes among propoxyphene users before and aftermarket withdrawal. 
  Study design:  Using OptumLabs data, we studied 3 populations: commercial, Medicare Advantage (MA) aged (age 65+ y) and MA disabled (age below 65 y) enrollees. The exposed enrollees received propoxyphene in the 3 months before market withdrawal (n=13,622); historical controls (unexposed) received propoxyphene 1 year earlier (n=9971). Regression models estimated daily milligrams morphine equivalent (MME), daily prescription acetaminophen dose, potentially toxic acetaminophen doses, nonopioid prescription analgesics receipt, emergency room visits, and diagnosed falls, motor vehicle accidents, and hip fractures. 
  Principal findings:  Aged MA enrollees illustrate the experience of all 3 populations examined. Following the market withdrawal, propoxyphene users in the exposed cohort experienced an abrupt decline of 69% in average daily MME, compared with a 14% decline in the unexposed. Opioids were discontinued by 34% of the exposed cohort and 18% of the unexposed. Tramadol and hydrocodone were the most common opioids substituted for propoxyphene. The proportion of each group receiving ≥4 g of prescription acetaminophen per day decreased from 12% to 2% in the exposed group but increased from 6% to 8% among the unexposed. Adverse events were rare and not significantly different in exposed versus unexposed groups. 
  Conclusions:  After propoxyphene market withdrawal, many individuals experienced abrupt discontinuation of opioids. Policymakers might consider supporting appropriate treatment transitions and monitoring responses following drug withdrawals.

These early versus late time windows approximately map onto feedforward and feedback processes, respectively. State-of-the-art convolutional neural networks, the main engine behind recent machine vision successes, are feedforward architectures. Their successes and limitations provide critical information regarding which visual tasks can be solved by purely feedforward processes and which require feedback mechanisms. We provide an overview of recent work in cognitive neuroscience and machine vision that highlights the possible role of feedback processes for both visual recognition and beyond. We conclude by discussing important open questions for future research.

PMID:32355515  |  Prognosis, Treatment, Genetics  |  Prognosis, Treatment, Genetics  |  LASSO regression  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies, with varying prognoses and a high mortality. There is an urgent need to establish a new prediction model to predict the survival risk of CRC patients. The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) expression profiles and corresponding clinical information of CRC patients were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas, TCGA. We identified a total of 1,176 lncRNAs differentially expressed between 480 CRC and 41 normal tissues. In the training test, we combined these differentially expressed lncRNAs with overall survival of CRC patients. Six lncRNAs (AL356270.1, LINC02257, AC020891.2, LINC01485, AC083967.1 and RBAKDN) were finally screened out by using LASSO regression mode to establish a novel prediction model as a prognostic indicator for CRC patients. The area under the curve (AUC) of 3- and 5-year ROC analysis in CRC were 0.6923 and 0.7328 for training set, and were 0.6803 and 0.7035 for testing set, respectively. K-M analysis revealed a significant difference between high risk and low risk in the training set (<i>P</i>-value = 5.0e-05) and testing set (<i>P</i>-value = 0.00052), respectively. Our study shows that the six lncRNAs model can improve the survival prediction mechanism of patients with CRC and provide help for patients through personalized treatment.

  Methods:  Hepatocellular carcinoma-bearing mice were injected intratumorally with microRNA-122 (miR-122) mimics and an miR-122 negative control in the treatment and control groups, respectively. The injections were performed every 3 days for 5 times (on days 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12). Before each injection and at the experiment ending, 2-dimensional ultrasound imaging was performed for tumor size measurement with RECIST and computing a quantitative imaging analysis with ultrasomics. To analyze the tumor perfusion by mRECIST, perfusion parameters were analyzed offline based on dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound image videos using SonoLiver software (TomTec, Unterschleissheim, Germany) on day 13. Tumor miR-122 expression was then analyzed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction experiments. 
  Results:  Tumors in mice treated with miR-122 mimics demonstrated a mean ± SD 763- ± 60-fold increase in miR-122 levels compared with tumors in the control group. With RECIST, a significant therapeutic response evaluated by tumor size changes was detected after day 9 (days 9, 12, and 13; P &lt; .001). With mRECIST, no parameters showed significant differences (P &gt; .05). Significant different features of the 2-dimensional ultrasound images between the groups were detected by the ultrasomics analysis, and the model could be successfully built. The ultrasomics score values between the groups were statistically significant after day 6 (days 6, 9, 12, and 13; P &lt; .05). 
  Conclusions:  Ultrasomics revealed significant changes after the second injection of miR-122, showing the potential as an important imaging biomarker for gene therapy.

Here, we identified the polarizing conditions to induce an IL22-producing CD8<sup>+</sup> Tc22 subset, which is dependent on IL6 and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor transcription factor. Further characterization showed that this subset was highly cytolytic and expressed a distinct cytokine profile and transcriptome relative to other subsets. In addition, polarized Tc22 were able to control tumor growth as well as, if not better than, the traditional IFNγ-producing Tc1 subset. Tc22s were also found to infiltrate the tumors of human patients with ovarian cancer, comprising up to approximately 30% of expanded CD8<sup>+</sup> tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). Importantly, IL22 production in these CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs correlated with improved recurrence-free survival. Given the antitumor properties of Tc22 cells, it may be prudent to polarize T cells to the Tc22 lineage when using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T or T-cell receptor (TCR) transduction-based immunotherapies.

  Methods:  Two CVD prediction models were developed from National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening Cohort (NHIS-HEALS): a Cox regression model and a DL model. Performance of each model was assessed in the internal and 2 external validation cohorts in Koreans (National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort; NHIS-NSC) and in Europeans (Rotterdam Study). A total of 412,030 adults in the NHIS-HEALS; 178,875 adults in the NHIS-NSC; and the 4,296 adults in Rotterdam Study were included. 
  Results:  Mean ages was 52 years (46% women) and there were 25,777 events (6.3%) in NHIS-HEALS during the follow-up. In internal validation, the DL approach demonstrated a C-statistic of 0.896 (95% confidence interval, 0.886-0.907) in men and 0.921 (0.908-0.934) in women and improved reclassification compared with Cox regression (net reclassification index [NRI], 24.8% in men, 29.0% in women). In external validation with NHIS-NSC, DL demonstrated a C-statistic of 0.868 (0.860-0.876) in men and 0.889 (0.876-0.898) in women, and improved reclassification compared with Cox regression (NRI, 24.9% in men, 26.2% in women). In external validation applied to the Rotterdam Study, DL demonstrated a C-statistic of 0.860 (0.824-0.897) in men and 0.867 (0.830-0.903) in women, and improved reclassification compared with Cox regression (NRI, 36.9% in men, 31.8% in women). 
  Conclusions:  A DL algorithm exhibited greater discriminative accuracy than Cox model approaches.

10.1186/s12916-020-01563-4  |  Smart Healthcare, Diagnosis, Treatment, Genetics  |  Diagnosis, Treatment, Smart Healthcare, Genetics  |  Deep Learning  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Healthcare represents a paradox. While change is everywhere, performance has flatlined: 60% of care on average is in line with evidence- or consensus-based guidelines, 30% is some form of waste or of low value, and 10% is harm. The 60-30-10 Challenge has persisted for three decades. 
  Main body:  Current top-down or chain-logic strategies to address this problem, based essentially on linear models of change and relying on policies, hierarchies, and standardisation, have proven insufficient. Instead, we need to marry ideas drawn from complexity science and continuous improvement with proposals for creating a deep learning health system. This dynamic learning model has the potential to assemble relevant information including patients' histories, and clinical, patient, laboratory, and cost data for improved decision-making in real time, or close to real time. If we get it right, the learning health system will contribute to care being more evidence-based and less wasteful and harmful. It will need a purpose-designed digital backbone and infrastructure, apply artificial intelligence to support diagnosis and treatment options, harness genomic and other new data types, and create informed discussions of options between patients, families, and clinicians. While there will be many variants of the model, learning health systems will need to spread, and be encouraged to do so, principally through diffusion of innovation models and local adaptations. 
  Conclusion:  Deep learning systems can enable us to better exploit expanding health datasets including traditional and newer forms of big and smaller-scale data, e.g. genomics and cost information, and incorporate patient preferences into decision-making. As we envisage it, a deep learning system will support healthcare's desire to continually improve, and make gains on the 60-30-10 dimensions. All modern health systems are awash with data, but it is only recently that we have been able to bring this together, operationalised, and turned into useful information by which to make more intelligent, timely decisions than in the past.

10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105475  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis  |  CNN, MSM-CNN  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background and objective:  Skin cancer is among the most common cancer types in the white population and consequently computer aided methods for skin lesion classification based on dermoscopic images are of great interest. A promising approach for this uses transfer learning to adapt pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for skin lesion diagnosis. Since pre-training commonly occurs with natural images of a fixed image resolution and these training images are usually significantly smaller than dermoscopic images, downsampling or cropping of skin lesion images is required. This however may result in a loss of useful medical information, while the ideal resizing or cropping factor of dermoscopic images for the fine-tuning process remains unknown. 
  Methods:  We investigate the effect of image size for skin lesion classification based on pre-trained CNNs and transfer learning. Dermoscopic images from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) skin lesion classification challenge datasets are either resized to or cropped at six different sizes ranging from 224 × 224 to 450 × 450. The resulting classification performance of three well established CNNs, namely EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB1 and SeReNeXt-50 is explored. We also propose and evaluate a multi-scale multi-CNN (MSM-CNN) fusion approach based on a three-level ensemble strategy that utilises the three network architectures trained on cropped dermoscopic images of various scales. 
  Results:  Our results show that image cropping is a better strategy compared to image resizing delivering superior classification performance at all explored image scales. Moreover, fusing the results of all three fine-tuned networks using cropped images at all six scales in the proposed MSM-CNN approach boosts the classification performance compared to a single network or a single image scale. On the ISIC 2018 skin lesion classification challenge test set, our MSM-CNN algorithm yields a balanced multi-class accuracy of 86.2% making it the currently second ranked algorithm on the live leaderboard. 
  Conclusions:  We confirm that the image size has an effect on skin lesion classification performance when employing transfer learning of CNNs. We also show that image cropping results in better performance compared to image resizing. Finally, a straightforward ensembling approach that fuses the results from images cropped at six scales and three fine-tuned CNNs is shown to lead to the best classification performance.

10.2196/17279  |  Smart Healthcare  |  Treatment  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Background:  Interprofessional team training is needed to improve nurse-physician communication skills that are lacking in clinical practice. Using simulations has proven to be an effective learning approach for team training. Yet, it has logistical constraints that call for the exploration of virtual environments in delivering team training. 
  Objective:  This study aimed to evaluate a team training program using virtual reality vs conventional live simulations on medical and nursing students' communication skill performances and teamwork attitudes. 
  Methods:  In June 2018, the authors implemented nurse-physician communication team training using communication tools. A randomized controlled trial study was conducted with 120 undergraduate medical and nursing students who were randomly assigned to undertake team training using virtual reality or live simulations. The participants from both groups were tested on their communication performances through team-based simulation assessments. Their teamwork attitudes were evaluated using interprofessional attitude surveys that were administered before, immediately after, and 2 months after the study interventions. 
  Results:  The team-based simulation assessment revealed no significant differences in the communication performance posttest scores (P=.29) between the virtual and simulation groups. Both groups reported significant increases in the interprofessional attitudes posttest scores from the baseline scores, with no significant differences found between the groups over the 3 time points. 
  Conclusions:  Our study outcomes did not show an inferiority of team training using virtual reality when compared with live simulations, which supports the potential use of virtual reality to substitute conventional simulations for communication team training. Future studies can leverage the use of artificial intelligence technology in virtual reality to replace costly human-controlled facilitators to achieve better scalability and sustainability of team-based training in interprofessional education.

10.1002/1878-0261.12635  |  Prognosis, Treatment, Genetics  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Treatment, Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   In breast cancer (BC), the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) has been related to relapse, metastasis, and radioresistance. Radiotherapy (RT) is an extended BC treatment, but is not always effective. CSCs have several mechanisms of radioresistance in place, and some miRNAs are involved in the cellular response to ionizing radiation (IR). Here, we studied how IR affects the expression of miRNAs related to stemness in different molecular BC subtypes. Exposition of BC cells to radiation doses of 2, 4, or 6 Gy affected their phenotype, functional characteristics, pluripotency gene expression, and in vivo tumorigenic capacity. This held true for various molecular subtypes of BC cells (classified by ER, PR and HER-2 status), and for BC cells either plated in monolayer, or being in suspension as mammospheres. However, the effect of IR on the expression of eight stemness- and radioresistance-related miRNAs (miR-210, miR-10b, miR-182, miR-142, miR-221, miR-21, miR-93, miR-15b) varied, depending on cell line subpopulation and clinicopathological features of BC patients. Therefore, clinicopathological features and, potentially also, chemotherapy regimen should be both taken into consideration, for determining a potential miRNA signature by liquid biopsy in BC patients treated with RT. Personalized and precision RT dosage regimes could improve the prognosis, treatment, and survival of BC patients.

10.3390/s20092460  |  None  |  None, Other  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Leaf area index (LAI) is an important biophysical parameter, which can be effectively applied in the estimation of vegetation growth status. At present, amounts of studies just focused on the LAI estimation of a single plant type, while plant types are usually mixed rather than single distribution. In this study, the suitability of GF-1 data for multi-species LAI estimation was evaluated by using Gaussian process regression (GPR), and a look-up table (LUT) combined with a PROSAIL radiative transfer model. Then, the performance of the LUT and GPR for multi-species LAI estimation was analyzed in term of 15 different band combinations and 10 published vegetation indices (VIs). Lastly, the effect of the different band combinations and published VIs on the accuracy of LAI estimation was discussed. The results indicated that GF-1 data exhibited a good potential for multi-species LAI retrieval. Then, GPR exhibited better performance than that of LUT for multi-species LAI estimation. What is more, modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) was selected based on the GPR algorithm for multi-species LAI estimation with a lower root mean squared error (RMSE = 0.6448 m<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>) compared to other band combinations and VIs. Then, this study can provide guidance for multi-species LAI estimation.

10.1016/j.canrad.2020.01.011  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Treatment, Genetics  |  Diagnosis, Prognosis, Treatment, Genetics  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Review  |    Purpose:  Radiomics are a set of methods used to leverage medical imaging and extract quantitative features that can characterize a patient's phenotype. All modalities can be used with several different software packages. Specific informatics methods can then be used to create meaningful predictive models. In this review, we will explain the major steps of a radiomics analysis pipeline and then present the studies published in the context of radiation therapy. 
  Methods:  A literature review was performed on Medline using the search engine PubMed. The search strategy included the search terms "radiotherapy", "radiation oncology" and "radiomics". The search was conducted in July 2019 and reference lists of selected articles were hand searched for relevance to this review. 
  Results:  A typical radiomics workflow always includes five steps: imaging and segmenting, data curation and preparation, feature extraction, exploration and selection and finally modeling. In radiation oncology, radiomics studies have been published to explore different clinical outcome in lung (n=5), head and neck (n=5), esophageal (n=3), rectal (n=3), pancreatic (n=2) cancer and brain metastases (n=2). The quality of these retrospective studies is heterogeneous and their results have not been translated to the clinic. 
  Conclusion:  Radiomics has a great potential to predict clinical outcome and better personalize treatment. But the field is still young and constantly evolving. Improvement in bias reduction techniques and multicenter studies will hopefully allow more robust and generalizable models.

10.1016/j.actbio.2020.02.007  |  Prognosis, Treatment, Genetics  |  Prognosis, Treatment, Genetics  |  Deep Learning  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Throughout the process of aging, dynamic changes of bone material, micro- and macro-architecture result in a loss of strength and therefore in an increased likelihood of fragility fractures. To date, precise contributions of age-related changes in bone (re)modeling and (de)mineralization dynamics to this fragility increase are not completely understood. Here, we present an image-based deep learning approach to quantitatively describe the effects of short-term aging and adaptive response to cyclic loading applied to proximal mouse tibiae and fibulae. Our approach allowed us to perform an end-to-end age prediction based on μCT imaging to determine the dynamic biological process of aging during a two week period, therefore permitting short-term bone aging analysis with 95% accuracy in predicting time points. In a second application, our deep learning analysis reveals that two weeks of in vivo mechanical loading are associated with an underlying rejuvenating effect of 5 days. Additionally, by quantitatively analyzing the learning process, we could, for the first time, identify the localization of the age-relevant encoded information and demonstrate 89% load-induced similarity of these locations in the loaded tibia with younger control bones. These data therefore suggest that our method enables identifying a general prognostic phenotype of a certain skeletal age as well as a temporal and localized loading-treatment effect on this apparent skeletal age for the studied mouse tibia and fibula. Future translational applications of this method may provide an improved decision-support method for osteoporosis treatment at relatively low cost. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Bone is a highly complex and dynamic structure that undergoes changes during the course of aging as well as in response to external stimuli, such as loading. Automatic assessment of "age" and "state" of the bone may lead to early prognosis of deceases such as osteoporosis and enables evaluating the effects of certain treatments. Here, we present an artificial intelligence-based method capable of automatically predicting the skeletal age from μCT images with 95% accuracy. Additionally, we utilize it to demonstrate the rejuvenation effects of in-vivo loading treatment on bones. We further, for the first time, break down aging-related local changes in bone by quantitatively analyzing "what the age assessment model has learned" and use this information to investigate the structural details of rejuvenation process.

10.1016/j.brainres.2020.146700  |  Treatment  |  Treatment, Genetics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   The central nervous system (CNS) has a limited auto-regeneration capacity, which makes it challenging for the development of new therapies. Previous studies from our lab have demonstrated the applicability of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) secretome as a possible therapeutic tool for CNS. Astrocytes, glial cells present in all brain regions, are important players in brain function through their vast influence in extracellular homeostasis, neuro-vascular regulation, synaptic modulation and neurogenesis. Thus, in the present work, we aimed to evaluate the specific impact of MSCs secretome on hippocampal proliferation and astrocyte morphology, in both WT and dnSNARE mice, a transgenic model that presents impaired astrocytic exocytosis and consequently impaired astrocytic function. Results demonstrated increased levels of proliferation for WT when treated with secretome. Additionally, it was possible to observe that dnSNARE animals injected with hBM-MSCs secretome disclosed increased levels of proliferating GFAP stained cells at the SGZ. Morphometrical evaluation found increased process hypertrophy and branching of dnSNARE astrocytes when treated with secretome. These results are closely related with the trophic factors present in the secretome, namely FGF-2, BDNF, GDNF, IGF-1, VEGF, CADH2, PEDF and miR-16. Moreover, the impaired exocytosis of astrocytes may also have implications for the response to the proliferative stimulus, given the established autocrine signaling through this mechanism.

 10.1021/acsami.9b22369  |  Robotics, Treatment  |  Robotics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Recently, neuromorphic devices have been receiving increasing interest in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Realization of fundamental synaptic plasticities on hard-ware devices would endow new intensions for neuromorphic devices. Spike-rate-dependent plasticity (SRDP) is one of the most important synaptic learning mechanisms in brain cognitive behaviors. It is thus interesting to mimic the SRDP behaviors on solid-state neuromorphic devices. In the present work, nanogranular phosphorus silicate glass (PSG)-based proton conductive electrolyte-gated oxide neuromorphic transistors have been proposed. The oxide neuromorphic transistors have good transistor performances and frequency-dependent synaptic plasticity behavior. Moreover, the neuromorphic transistor exhibits SRDP activities. Interestingly, by introducing priming synaptic stimuli, the modulation of threshold frequency value distinguishing synaptic potentiation from synaptic depression is realized for the first time on an electrolyte-gated neuromorphic transistor. Such a mechanism can be well understood with interfacial proton gating effects of the nanogranular PSG-based electrolyte. Furthermore, the effects of SRDP learning rules on pattern learning and memory behaviors have been conceptually demonstrated. The proposed neuromorphic transistors have potential applications in neuromorphic engineering.

10.1186/s12969-020-0404-8  |  Prognosis  |  None, Other  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Backgrounds:  In order to provide juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients with better pre-conceptional and prenatal counselling, we investigated the obstetrical and neonatal outcomes among women with Asian descent. 
  Methods:  Through the linkage of Taiwan National Health Insurance database and National Birth Registry, we established a population-based birth cohort in Taiwan between 2004 and 2014. In a case control study design, first children born to mothers with JIA are identified and matched with 5 non-JIA controls by maternal age and birth year. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios for maternal and neonatal outcomes crude and with adjustment. 
  Results:  Of the 2,100,143 newborn, 778 (0.037%) were born to JIA mothers. Among them, 549 first-born children were included in this research. Our result suggested that babies born to mothers with JIA were more likely to have low birth body weight, with an adjusted OR of 1.35(95% CI: 1.02 to 1.79) when compared to babies born to mothers without. No differences were observed in other perinatal complications between women with and without JIA including stillbirth, prematurity, or small for gestational age. The rate of adverse obstetrical outcomes such as caesarean delivery, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, postpartum hemorrhage and mortality were also similar between the two. 
  Conclusions:  Adverse obstetrical and neonatal outcomes were limited among Asian mothers with JIA. Intensive care may not be necessary for JIA mothers and their newborns.

10.1002/jemt.23429  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis  |  SVM  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   The numbers of diagnosed patients by melanoma are drastic and contribute more deaths annually among young peoples. An approximately 192,310 new cases of skin cancer are diagnosed in 2019, which shows the importance of automated systems for the diagnosis process. Accordingly, this article presents an automated method for skin lesions detection and recognition using pixel-based seed segmented images fusion and multilevel features reduction. The proposed method involves four key steps: (a) mean-based function is implemented and fed input to top-hat and bottom-hat filters which later fused for contrast stretching, (b) seed region growing and graph-cut method-based lesion segmentation and fused both segmented lesions through pixel-based fusion, (c) multilevel features such as histogram oriented gradient (HOG), speeded up robust features (SURF), and color are extracted and simple concatenation is performed, and (d) finally variance precise entropy-based features reduction and classification through SVM via cubic kernel function. Two different experiments are performed for the evaluation of this method. The segmentation performance is evaluated on PH2, ISBI2016, and ISIC2017 with an accuracy of 95.86, 94.79, and 94.92%, respectively. The classification performance is evaluated on PH2 and ISBI2016 dataset with an accuracy of 98.20 and 95.42%, respectively. The results of the proposed automated systems are outstanding as compared to the current techniques reported in state of art, which demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.

10.1016/j.cyto.2020.155051  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis  |  Clustering, RandomForest  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   This study aimed to reveal a new dimension of allergy profiles in the general population by using machine learning to explore complex relationships among various cytokines/chemokines and allergic diseases (asthma and atopic dermatitis; AD). We examined the symptoms related to asthma and AD and the plasma levels of 72 cytokines/chemokines obtained from a general population of 161 children at 6 years of age who participated in a pilot birth cohort study of the Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS). The children whose signs and symptoms fulfilled the criteria of AD, which are mostly based on questionnaire including past symptoms, tended to have higher levels of the two chemokine ligands, CCL17 and CCL27, which are used for diagnosis of AD. On the other hand, another AD-related chemokine CCL22 level in plasma was higher only in children with visible flexural eczema, which is one of AD diagnostic criteria but was judged on the same day of blood examination unlike other criteria. Here, we also developed an innovative method of machine learning for elucidating the complex cytokine/chemokine milieu related to symptoms of allergic diseases by using clustering analysis based on the random forest dissimilarity measure that relies on artificial intelligence (AI) technique. To our surprise, the majority of children showing at least any asthma-related symptoms during the last month were divided by AI into the two clusters, either cluster-2 having elevated levels of IL-33 (related to eosinophil activation) or cluster-3 having elevated levels of CXCL7/NAP2 (related to neutrophil activation), among the total three clusters. Future studies will clarify better approach for allergic diseases by endotype classification.

10.1016/j.artmed.2019.101782  |  Treatment, Prognosis  |  Treatment  |  SimilarityNetworkFusion  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Objective:  Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) contain temporal and heterogeneous doctor order information that can be used for treatment pattern discovery. Our objective is to identify "right patient", "right drug", "right dose", "right route", and "right time" from doctor order information. 
  Methods:  We propose a fusion framework to extract typical treatment patterns based on multi-view similarity Network Fusion (SNF) method. The multi-view SNF method involves three similarity measures: content-view similarity, sequence-view similarity and duration-view similarity. An EMR dataset and two metrics were utilized to evaluate the performance and to extract typical treatment patterns. 
  Results:  Experimental results on a real-world EMR dataset show that the multi-view similarity network fusion method outperforms all the single-view similarity measures and also outperforms the existing similarity measure methods. Furthermore, we extract and visualize typical treatment patterns by clustering analysis. 
  Conclusion:  The extracted typical treatment patterns by combining doctor order content, sequence, and duration views can provide data-driven guidelines for artificial intelligence in medicine and help clinicians make better decisions in clinical practice.

10.1016/j.enfcli.2019.09.024  |  Robotics  |  Robotics  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   The issue of older adults' care is becoming a serious concern in Japan, which has a rapidly aging population and a low birthrate. The development of robots is pushed forward as a measure to compensate for the healthcare worker shortage. The purpose of this paper is to consider the potential legal issues of caring healthcare robot (CHR) for older adults' care. A CHR must recognize the speech, face, and presence of older adults, and make judgments and relay information based on acquired information. CHRs fulfill the caring function by being close to patients, to know them deeply, and to look after them. Therefore, communication functions by advanced artificial intelligence based on caring in nursing are essential for CHRs. The ability to maintain and improve the activities of daily living (ADL) of older adults is to facilitate activities through bidirectional information relay. Furthermore, without guarantees on the safety and ascription of responsibilities, the introduction of CHRs in clinical practice will not proceed. As laws differ from country to country, it is necessary to examine Japanese policies and related laws when using CHRs in Japan. Currently, there are no central rules on information security. In Japan, the law is made after a case has occurred; thus, dealing with novel issues as they occur will not have the benefit of legal guidance. Creating a broad legal framework or taking preventive measures at an early stage is needed. Therefore, as a first step, establishing guidelines for the use of CHRs will be valuable.

10.21037/atm.2019.12.150  |  Treatment  |  Robotics  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Optimal acetabular cup orientation is of substantial importance to good long-term function and low complication rates after total hip arthroplasty (THA). The radiographic anteversion (RA) and inclination (RI) angles of the cup are typically studied due to the practicability, simplicity, and ease of interpretation of their measurements. A great number of methods have been developed to date, most of which have been performed on pelvic or hip anteroposterior radiographs. However, there are primarily two influencing factors for these methods: X-ray offset and pelvic rotation. In addition, there are three types of pelvic rotations about the transverse, longitudinal, and anteroposterior axes of the body. Their effects on the RA and RI angles of the cup are interactively correlated with the position and true orientation of the cup. To date, various fitted or analytical models have been established to disclose the correlations between the X-ray offset and pelvic rotation and the RA and RI angles of the cup. Most of these models do not incorporate all the potential influencing parameters. Advanced methods for performing X-ray offset and pelvic rotation corrections are mainly performed on a single pelvic AP radiograph, two synchronized radiographs, or a two-dimensional/three-dimensional (2D-3D) registration system. Some measurement systems, originally developed for evaluating implant migration or wear, could also be used for correcting the X-ray offset and pelvic rotation simultaneously, but some drawbacks still exist with these systems. Above all, the 2D-3D registration technique might be an alternative and powerful tool for accurately measuring cup orientation. In addition to the current methods used for postoperative assessment, navigation systems and augmented reality are also used for the preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance of cup placement. With the continuing development of artificial intelligence and machine learning, these techniques could be incorporated into robot-assisted orthopaedic surgery in the future.

10.1089/brain.2019.0722  |  None, Other  |  None, Other  |  Hard Ensemble  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   This work addresses the problem of constructing a unified, topologically optimal connectivity-based brain atlas. The proposed approach aggregates an ensemble partition from individual parcellations without label agreement, providing a balance between sufficiently flexible individual parcellations and intuitive representation of the average topological structure of the connectome. The methods exploit a previously proposed dense connectivity representation, first performing graph-based hierarchical parcellation of individual brains, and subsequently aggregating the individual parcellations into a consensus parcellation. The search for consensus - based on the Hard Ensemble algorithm - approximately minimizes the sum of cluster membership distances, effectively estimating a pseudo-Karcher mean of individual parcellations. Computational stability, graph structure preservation and biological relevance of the simplified representation resulting from the proposed parcellation are assessed on the Human Connectome Project dataset. These aspects are assessed using (1) edge weight distribution divergence with respect to the dense connectome representation, (2) inter-hemispheric symmetry, (3) network characteristics' stability and agreement with respect to individually and anatomically parcellated networks, and (4) performance of the simplified connectome in a biological sex classification task. Ensemble parcellation was found to be highly stable with respect to subject sampling, outperforming anatomical atlases and other connectome-based parcellations in classification as well as preserving global connectome properties. The Hard Ensemble-based parcellation also showed a degree symmetry comparable to anatomical atlases and a high degree of spatial contiguity without using explicit priors.

10.1177/0886260520913648  |  Prognosis  |  Prognosis  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Sexual violence (SV) is a public health concern for youth. Few longitudinal studies address how experiences of SV and co-occurring depression and anxiety symptoms in early young adulthood may contribute to poorer functioning in young adulthood. Using a sample of 2,416 youth aged 18 to 20 (Time 1), we assessed past year SV and co-occurring depression and anxiety symptoms. One year later, when youth were between the ages of 20 and 22 (Time 2), participants indicated their functioning in four domains: physical health and sleep quality, substance use consequences, psychological functioning, and social functioning. Using latent class analyses, we found six participant classes at Time 1 based on SV experiences and co-occurring depression and anxiety symptoms. Classes were variable by participants' reported degree of SV experiences and co-occurring depression and anxiety symptomology. Longitudinal analyses indicated that youth in a class that experienced high levels of both SV and co-occurring depression and anxiety at Time 1 generally reported the poorest functioning in all key domains at Time 2. However, classes where participants reported greater depression and anxiety symptoms-most often in the presence of, but at times in the absence of, SV-were consistently associated with poorer functioning for physical health, psychological functioning, and social health. Classes where participants reported greater SV-in the presence of, but at times in the absence of, depression and anxiety symptoms-were associated with greater alcohol and marijuana consequences. Findings suggest prevention of SV, accessible counseling for those that have experienced SV, and screening to identify and intervene to address depression and anxiety may all be essential to help prevent poorer functioning in young adulthood.

10.1093/jamia/ocz166  |  None, Other  |  None, Other  |  SVM, Rules  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Review  |    Objective:  This article summarizes the preparation, organization, evaluation, and results of Track 2 of the 2018 National NLP Clinical Challenges shared task. Track 2 focused on extraction of adverse drug events (ADEs) from clinical records and evaluated 3 tasks: concept extraction, relation classification, and end-to-end systems. We perform an analysis of the results to identify the state of the art in these tasks, learn from it, and build on it. 
  Materials and methods:  For all tasks, teams were given raw text of narrative discharge summaries, and in all the tasks, participants proposed deep learning-based methods with hand-designed features. In the concept extraction task, participants used sequence labelling models (bidirectional long short-term memory being the most popular), whereas in the relation classification task, they also experimented with instance-based classifiers (namely support vector machines and rules). Ensemble methods were also popular. 
  Results:  A total of 28 teams participated in task 1, with 21 teams in tasks 2 and 3. The best performing systems set a high performance bar with F1 scores of 0.9418 for concept extraction, 0.9630 for relation classification, and 0.8905 for end-to-end. However, the results were much lower for concepts and relations of Reasons and ADEs. These were often missed because local context is insufficient to identify them. 
  Conclusions:  This challenge shows that clinical concept extraction and relation classification systems have a high performance for many concept types, but significant improvement is still required for ADEs and Reasons. Incorporating the larger context or outside knowledge will likely improve the performance of future systems.

10.1007/s00345-020-03214-y  |  Treatment, Diagnosis  |  Treatment  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Purpose:  Urological oncologists have difficulty providing optimal personalized care due to rapid alterations in scientific research results, medical advancements, and treatment guidelines. IBM's Watson for Oncology (WFO) is an artificial intelligence clinical decision-support system that assists oncologists with evidence-based treatment recommendations. In the present study, we examined the level of concordance between the treatment recommendations for prostate cancer according to WFO and the actual treatments that the patients received in the department of urology. 
  Methods:  We enrolled 201 patients who received prostate cancer treatment between January 2018 and June 2018. WFO provided treatment recommendations using clinical data in three categories: recommended, for consideration, and not recommended. These were compared with the actual treatments received by patients. Prostate cancer treatments were considered concordant if the received treatments were included in the "recommended" or "for consideration" categories by WFO. 
  Results:  The patients' mean age was 71.2 years. There were 60 (29.9%) and 114 (56.7%) patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score ≥ 1 and non-organ confined disease (stage III/IV), respectively. The overall prostate cancer treatment concordance rate was 73.6% ("recommended": 53.2%; "for consideration": 20.4%). An ECOG performance score ≥ 1 and older age (≥ 75 years) were significantly associated with discordance (p = 0.001 and p = 0.026, respectively) on multivariate analysis. 
  Conclusion:  In the present study, the treatment recommendations by WFO and the actual received treatments in the department of urology showed a relatively high concordance rate in prostate cancer patients.

10.3390/s20092467  |  Smart Healthcare  |  Prognosis, Robotics  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Review  |  Review  |   Today, daily life is composed of many computing systems, therefore interacting with them in a natural way makes the communication process more comfortable. Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has been developed to overcome the communication barriers between humans and computers. One form of HCI is Hand Gesture Recognition (HGR), which predicts the class and the instant of execution of a given movement of the hand. One possible input for these models is surface electromyography (EMG), which records the electrical activity of skeletal muscles. EMG signals contain information about the intention of movement generated by the human brain. This systematic literature review analyses the state-of-the-art of real-time hand gesture recognition models using EMG data and machine learning. We selected and assessed 65 primary studies following the Kitchenham methodology. Based on a common structure of machine learning-based systems, we analyzed the structure of the proposed models and standardized concepts in regard to the types of models, data acquisition, segmentation, preprocessing, feature extraction, classification, postprocessing, real-time processing, types of gestures, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we also identified trends and gaps that could open new directions of work for future research in the area of gesture recognition using EMG.

10.1111/febs.15314  |  None, Other  |  None, Other  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Crystallographic models of biological macromolecules have been ranked using the quality criteria associated with them in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The outcomes of this quality analysis have been correlated with time and with the journals that published papers based on those models. The results show that the overall quality of PDB structures has substantially improved over the last ten years, but this period of progress was preceded by several years of stagnation or even depression. Moreover, the study shows that the historically observed negative correlation between journal impact and the quality of structural models presented therein seems to disappear as time progresses.

10.3390/diagnostics10040196  |  Diagnosis, Smart Healthcare, Prognosis  |  Diagnosis, Smart Healthcare  |  SVM, Random Forests, CNN  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Narrative texts in electronic health records can be efficiently utilized for building decision support systems in the clinic, only if they are correctly interpreted automatically in accordance with a specified standard. This paper tackles the problem of developing an automated method of labeling free-form radiology reports, as a precursor for building query-capable report databases in hospitals. The analyzed dataset consists of 1295 radiology reports concerning the condition of a knee, retrospectively gathered at the Clinical Hospital Centre Rijeka, Croatia. Reports were manually labeled with one or more labels from a set of 10 most commonly occurring clinical conditions. After primary preprocessing of the texts, two sets of text classification methods were compared: (1) traditional classification models-Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forests (RF)-coupled with Bag-of-Words (BoW) features (i.e., symbolic text representation) and (2) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) coupled with dense word vectors (i.e., word embeddings as a semantic text representation) as input features. We resorted to nested 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of competing methods using accuracy, precision, recall, and F 1 score. The CNN with semantic word representations as input yielded the overall best performance, having a micro-averaged F 1 score of 86 . 7 % . The CNN classifier yielded particularly encouraging results for the most represented conditions: degenerative disease ( 95 . 9 % ), arthrosis ( 93 . 3 % ), and injury ( 89 . 2 % ). As a data-hungry deep learning model, the CNN, however, performed notably worse than the competing models on underrepresented classes with fewer training instances such as multicausal disease or metabolic disease. LR, RF, and SVM performed comparably well, with the obtained micro-averaged F 1 scores of 84 . 6 % , 82 . 2 % , and 82 . 1 % , respectively.

10.1002/mp.13978  |  Diagnosis, Treatment  |  Diagnosis, Treatment  |  U-Net (CNN)  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |    Purpose:  Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scanning is used daily or weekly (i.e., on-treatment CBCT) for accurate patient setup in image-guided radiotherapy. However, inaccuracy of CT numbers prevents CBCT from performing advanced tasks such as dose calculation and treatment planning. Motivated by the promising performance of deep learning in medical imaging, we propose a deep U-net-based approach that synthesizes CT-like images with accurate numbers from planning CT, while keeping the same anatomical structure as on-treatment CBCT. 
  Methods:  We formulated the CT synthesis problem under a deep learning framework, where a deep U-net architecture was used to take advantage of the anatomical structure of on-treatment CBCT and image intensity information of planning CT. U-net was chosen because it exploits both global and local features in the image spatial domain, matching our task to suppress global scattering artifacts and local artifacts such as noise in CBCT. To train the synthetic CT generation U-net (sCTU-net), we include on-treatment CBCT and initial planning CT of 37 patients (30 for training, seven for validation) as the input. Additional replanning CT images acquired on the same day as CBCT after deformable registration are utilized as the corresponding reference. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed sCTU-net, we use another seven independent patient cases (560 slices) for testing. 
  Results:  We quantitatively compared the resulting synthetic CT (sCT) with the original CBCT image using deformed same-day pCT images as reference. The averaged accuracy measured by mean absolute error (MAE) between sCT and reference CT (rCT) on testing data is 18.98 HU, while MAE between CBCT and rCT is 44.38 HU. 
  Conclusions:  The proposed sCTU-net can synthesize CT-quality images with accurate CT numbers from on-treatment CBCT and planning CT. This potentially enables advanced CBCT applications for adaptive treatment planning.

10.3390/bs10020055  |  Prognosis  |  None, Other  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Postpartum Depression (PPD), a condition that affects up to 15% of mothers in high-income countries, reduces attention to the needs of the child and is among the first causes of infanticide. PPD is usually identified using self-report measures and therefore it is possible that mothers are unwilling to report PPD because of a social desirability bias. Previous studies have highlighted the presence of significant differences in the acoustical properties of the vocalizations of infants of depressed and healthy mothers, suggesting that the mothers' behavior can induce changes in infants' vocalizations. In this study, cry episodes of infants (N = 56, 157.4 days ± 8.5, 62% firstborn) of depressed (N = 29) and non-depressed (N = 27) mothers (mean age = 31.1 years ± 3.9) are analyzed to investigate the possibility that a cloud-based machine learning model can identify PPD in mothers from the acoustical properties of their infants' vocalizations. Acoustic features (fundamental frequency, first four formants, and intensity) are first extracted from recordings of crying infants, then cloud-based artificial intelligence models are employed to identify maternal depression versus non-depression from estimated features. The trained model shows that commonly adopted acoustical features can be successfully used to identify postpartum depressed mothers with high accuracy (89.5%).

10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00026  |  Prognosis  |  Prognosis  |  None  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   Bullying and sibling aggression can appear as similar behavior, though the latter is comparatively understudied. Aligned with the Theory of Intergenerational Transmission of Violence, research suggests that exposure to family violence increases an individual's risk for perpetrating violence in their own future relationships. Additionally, Problem Behavior Theory suggests that engaging in one problem behavior (e.g., bullying) increases the likelihood of engaging in other problem behavior (e.g., substance use). In Phase 1, this study of middle school students from the U.S. examined how exposure to family violence predicted membership in latent classes of bullying and sibling aggression perpetration (<i>N</i> = 894, sampled from four middle schools). In Phase 2, we used mixture modeling to understand how latent classes of family violence, sibling aggression, and bullying predict future substance use, mental health outcomes, and deviance behavior later in high school. Results yielded four profiles of peer and sibling aggression: <i>high all</i>, <i>high sibling aggression</i>, <i>high peer aggression</i>, and <i>low all aggression</i>. Youth who reported witnessing more family violence at home were significantly more likely to fall into the <i>sibling aggression</i> only and <i>high all</i> classes, compared to the <i>low all</i> class. Phase 2 results also yielded four classes: a <i>high all</i> class, a <i>sibling aggression and family violence</i> class, a <i>peer aggression</i> class, and a <i>low all</i> class. Individuals in the <i>high all</i> class were more likely to experience several unfavorable outcomes (substance use, depression, delinquency) compared to other classes. This study provides evidence for pathways from witnessing violence, to perpetrating aggression across multiple contexts, to developing other deleterious mental and behavioral health outcomes. These findings highlight the negative impact family violence can have on child development, providing support for a cross-contextual approach for programming aimed at developing relationships skills.

10.1007/s11548-019-02114-w  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis  |  AITechniqueM  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Review  |    Purpose:  Intensive planning and analysis from echocardiography are a crucial step before reconstructive surgeries are applied to malfunctioning mitral valves. Volume visualizations of echocardiographic data are often used in clinical routine. However, they lack a clear visualization of the crucial factors for decision making. 
  Methods:  We build upon patient-specific mitral valve surface models segmented from echocardiography that represent the valve's geometry, but suffer from self-occlusions due to complex 3D shape. We transfer these to 2D maps by unfolding their geometry, resulting in a novel 2D representation that maintains anatomical resemblance to the 3D geometry. It can be visualized together with color mappings and presented to physicians to diagnose the pathology in one gaze without the need for further scene interaction. Furthermore, it facilitates the computation of a Pathology Score, which can be used for diagnosis support. 
  Results:  Quality and effectiveness of the proposed methods were evaluated through a user survey conducted with domain experts. We assessed pathology detection accuracy using 3D valve models in comparison with the novel visualizations. Classification accuracy increased by 5.3% across all tested valves and by 10.0% for prolapsed valves. Further, the participants' understanding of the relation between 3D and 2D views was evaluated. The Pathology Score is found to have potential to support discriminating pathologic valves from normal valves. 
  Conclusions:  In summary, our survey shows that pathology detection can be improved in comparison with simple 3D surface visualizations of the mitral valve. The correspondence between the 2D and 3D representations is comprehensible, and color-coded pathophysiological magnitudes further support the clinical assessment.

10.3390/s20041068  |  Diagnosis  |  Diagnosis  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   An entity's existence in an image can be depicted by the activity instantiation vector from a group of neurons (called capsule). Recently, multi-layered capsules, called CapsNet, have proven to be state-of-the-art for image classification tasks. This research utilizes the prowess of this algorithm to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray (CXR) images. Here, an entity in the CXR image can help determine if the patient (whose CXR is used) is suffering from pneumonia or not. A simple model of capsules (also known as Simple CapsNet) has provided results comparable to best Deep Learning models that had been used earlier. Subsequently, a combination of convolutions and capsules is used to obtain two models that outperform all models previously proposed. These models-Integration of convolutions with capsules (ICC) and Ensemble of convolutions with capsules (ECC)-detect pneumonia with a test accuracy of 95.33% and 95.90%, respectively. The latter model is studied in detail to obtain a variant called EnCC, where n = 3, 4, 8, 16. Here, the E4CC model works optimally and gives test accuracy of 96.36%. All these models had been trained, validated, and tested on 5857 images from Mendeley.

10.3389/fnhum.2019.00457  |  Smart Healthcare  |  Smart Healthcare  |  Unclear  |  AITechniqueA  |  Research  |  Research  |   To characterize each cognitive function <i>per se</i> and to understand the brain as an aggregate of those functions, it is vital to relate dozens of these functions to each other. Knowledge about the relationships among cognitive functions is informative not only for basic neuroscientific research but also for clinical applications and developments of brain-inspired artificial intelligence. In the present study, we propose an exhaustive data mining approach to reveal relationships among cognitive functions based on functional brain mapping and network analysis. We began our analysis with 109 pseudo-activation maps (cognitive function maps; CFM) that were reconstructed from a functional magnetic resonance imaging meta-analysis database, each of which corresponds to one of 109 cognitive functions such as 'emotion,' 'attention,' 'episodic memory,' etc. Based on the resting-state functional connectivity between the CFMs, we mapped the cognitive functions onto a two-dimensional space where the relevant functions were located close to each other, which provided a rough picture of the brain as an aggregate of cognitive functions. Then, we conducted so-called conceptual analysis of cognitive functions using clustering of voxels in each CFM connected to the other 108 CFMs with various strengths. As a result, a CFM for each cognitive function was subdivided into several parts, each of which is strongly associated with some CFMs for a subset of the other cognitive functions, which brought in sub-concepts (i.e., sub-functions) of the cognitive function. Moreover, we conducted network analysis for the network whose nodes were parcels derived from whole-brain parcellation based on the whole-brain voxel-to-CFM resting-state functional connectivities. Since each parcel is characterized by associations with the 109 cognitive functions, network analyses using them are expected to inform about relationships between cognitive and network characteristics. Indeed, we found that informational diversities of interaction between parcels and densities of local connectivity were dependent on the kinds of associated functions. In addition, we identified the homogeneous and inhomogeneous network communities about the associated functions. Altogether, we suggested the effectiveness of our approach in which we fused the large-scale meta-analysis of functional brain mapping with the methods of network neuroscience to investigate the relationships among cognitive functions.
