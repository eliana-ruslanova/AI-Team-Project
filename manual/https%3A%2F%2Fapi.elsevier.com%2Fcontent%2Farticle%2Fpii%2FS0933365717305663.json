Each selected work has been carefully analyzed in order to identify its objective, methodology and results.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  The review showed the majority of works make use of signal-based data, which are often acquired by means of sensors. Also, we have observed the increasing number of works that employ virtual reality and e-health monitoring systems to increase the life quality of PD patients. Despite the different approaches found in the literature, almost all of them make use of some sort of machine learning mechanism to aid the automatic PD diagnosis.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  The main focus of this survey is to consider computer-assisted diagnosis, and how effective they can be when handling the problem of PD identification. Also, the main contribution of this review is to consider very recent works only, mainly from 2015 and 2016.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Parkinson's Disease"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Parkinsonian"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Machine Learning"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0933365717305663", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365717305663", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85052940134", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85052940134", "pubmed-id": "30201325", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85052940134", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20180907", "$": "2018-09-07"}}}}, "subfield": ["Treatment", "Diagnosis", "Smart Healthcare"], "classified": "None"}
