AI may be subdivided into strong AI (with consciousness and intentionality) and weak AI (lacking both and programmed to perform specific tasks only). With AI currently making rapid progress in all domains, including those of healthcare, physicians face possible competitors. Various types of AI programs are already available as consultants to the physician, and these help in medical diagnostics and treatment. At the time of writing, extant programs constitute weak AI. This paper will explore the development of AI and robotics in medicine, and will refer to Star Trek's \u201cEmergency Medical Hologram\u201d, who is portrayed as a strong AI program. This paper will also briefly explore the issues pertaining to AI in the medical field and will show that weak AI should not only suffice in the demesne of healthcare, but may actually be more desirable than strong AI.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378378220301481", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378378220301481", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85081951464", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85081951464", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85081951464", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20200320", "$": "2020-03-20"}}}}, "subfield": "None", "classified": "None"}
