However, AI also raises several challenges and ethical concerns. In this article, the author investigates and discusses three aspects of AI in medicine and healthcare: the application and promises of AI, special ethical concerns pertaining to AI in some frontier fields, and suggestive ethical governance systems. Despite great potentials of frontier AI research and development in the field of medical care, the ethical challenges induced by its applications has put forward new requirements for governance. To ensure \u201ctrustworthy\u201d AI applications in healthcare and medicine, the creation of an ethical global governance framework and system as well as special guidelines for frontier AI applications in medicine are suggested. The most important aspects include the roles of governments in ethical auditing and the responsibilities of stakeholders in the ethical governance system.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "artificial intelligence"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "medical ethics"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "ethical governance"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "machine learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "brain-computer interaction"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "brain-inspired computer"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "robots"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "biohybrids"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1001929419300288", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1001929419300288", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85068830066", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85068830066", "pubmed-id": "31315747", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85068830066", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20190715", "$": "2019-07-15"}}}}, "subfield": "None", "classified": "None"}
