      "  Objective:  Assess sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of two approaches to identify patients with implantable devices that pose safety risks for MRI-an expert-derived approach and an ontology-derived natural language processing (NLP). Determine the proportion of clinical data that identify these implantable devices.   Methods:  This Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective study was performed at a 793-bed academic hospital. The expert-derived approach used an open-source software with a list of curated terms to query for implantable devices posing high safety risk (\"MRI-Red\") in patients undergoing MRI. The ontology-derived approach used an NLP system with terms mapped to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms. Queries were performed in three clinical data types-25,000 radiology reports, 174,769 emergency department (ED) notes, and 41,085 other clinical reports (eg, cardiology, operating room, physician notes, radiology reports, pathology reports, patient letters). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of both methods against manual review of a randomly sampled 465 reports were assessed and tested for significant differences between expert-derived and ontology-derived approaches using t test.   Results:  Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of expert-versus ontology-derived approaches were similar (0.83 versus 0.91, P = .080; 0.88 versus 0.96, P = .178; 0.82 versus 0.92, P = .110). The proportion of radiology reports, ED notes, and other clinical reports retrieved containing implantable devices with high safety risks for MRI ranged from 1.47% to 1.88%.   Discussion:  Artificial intelligence approaches such as expert-driven NLP and ontology-driven NLP have similar accuracy in identifying patients with implantable devices that pose high safety risks for MRI. \n"

      "We investigate the adaptation and specialization of areas in a hierarchically organized visual processing stream using both a real-world robot, as well as a simulated virtual approximation (see \n",
      "\t\t\t\t). The agents are embedded in a complex environment, and a camera mounted on the robot provides continuous input to the neural network (A). The model of the visual system consists of five areas each comprising units with both intra-area and feed-forward inter-area connections (B). The convergence of the feed-forward connectivity increases while moving up the hierarchy, similar to that observed in the visual pathway []. These feed-forward connections are subject to online unsupervised learning optimizing a temporal stability objective while the intra-area connections serve the decorrelation of the states of one area. In addition, all units are leaky integrators providing them with a local transient memory trace. The data analysis focuses on the learning and network dynamics and a comparison of the response properties of neurons at different levels of the hierarchy with their respective counterparts in the real brain.\n",
      "\t\t\t(A) A camera mounted on top of the cylindrical body provides the visual input that is processed by our model of the ventral visual system. The infra-red (IR) sensors are used for obstacle avoidance during exploration of a real-world office environment within an arena of approximately 31 × 22 cm.\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t(B) Diagram showing the hierarchical network comprising five levels of identical computational units. Units are arranged uniformly within a two-dimensional square lattice, and their number per level decreases with a constant factor of 0.5 moving up the hierarchy. Each efferent unit receives input from a topographically aligned square region within the afferent level (red connectivity) and connects laterally to all the units in the same level with which it shares feed-forward input (blue connectivity). The average relative size of a unit's feed-forward arbor within the afferent level (as given in percentages), and consequently also the lateral degree of connectivity, increases with the hierarchical level and reaches 100% for the units at the highest level. The input to the network has a resolution of 16 × 16 pixels.Exposing the network to the visual input provided by the mobile robot, we observe that after approximately 6 ·10 time steps (66 h of real-time, with a frame rate of 25 Hz) the stability of all levels has converged (). In addition, the model shows that the reorganization of the levels, in terms of their stability, follows the hierarchical order of the system, i.e., higher levels enhance their stability only after their afferent levels have reached a certain level of stable representations. After convergence, units at different processing levels show characteristic differences in their response properties. In particular, cells at the first level show orientation selectivity confirming previous results [,\n",
      "\t\t\t\t] (unpublished data). In the following, we analyze the response properties of the cells at different levels with respect to the orientation and position of the robot within the environment (A). Both the view dependence and the size of the region where activity can be elicited varies significantly with respect to the hierarchical level (one-way ANOVA, F(4,491) = 30.6, 128.3, respectively, \n",
      "\t\t\t\t ≪ .001). The view dependence of the units increases from the first to the third level on average by 16% and subsequently decreases and reaches its minimum at the last level, 32% below the first level (B). In contrast, the size of the regions in which individual units are activated decreases monotonically (C). On average, units at the first level are responsive within 52% of the environment. In contrast, units at the highest level only cover 24% of the environment. In order to control for an increasing fragmentation of the representations, we also measure the compactness of the responsive region, which does not change significantly across the hierarchical levels (D, F(4,491) = 1.28, p > 0.2). In summary, these results show that our model captures pertinent properties of the ventral visual stream. The response properties of units at early stages are selective to low-level features. Such features are visible from many different positions within the environment and the responsive regions tend to be large and selective for the orientation of the robot. At intermediate stages, each unit responds specifically to a particular view from a region of limited size, similar to landmarks, leading to a high orientation selectivity. Higher levels learn to associate neighboring “landmark” views, rendering small, compact responsive regions. At the highest level, these “landmark” representations are combined into an allocentric representation of space: a place field that is highly selectively for the robot being at a certain position within the environment irrespective of its orientation [,\n",

The response maps show responses of cells averaged across the robot's orientation where the black contour (responsive region) identifies the 50% level of the maximal response. The polar plot shows the mean ±SD of the unit's activity within the black region with respect to 16 equally spaced orientations covering 360°. Both response maps and polar plots are normalized to the maximal response of the units across space or orientation, respectively. (B and C) Boxplots of the view, dependence, size, and compactness of the responsive regions versus the hierarchical level of the units. The blue box represents the upper and lower quartiles. The median is indicated by the red horizontal line whereas the extent of the remaining data is given by the vertical whiskers. The view dependence is measured as the CV of the response of a unit across orientations for a fixed position, averaged across the responsive region. The size of the responsive region is normalized to the size of the environment. The compactness is given by the ratio between the true perimeter of the 50% contour and the perimeter of a disc with equal area.The receptive field (RF) sizes of the feed-forward projections are bounded by the synaptic arbors of the cells at the different levels of the hierarchy. Optimizing the weights of these synapses, however, may result in different effective RF sizes. Therefore, we subsequently compare the optimized hierarchy to a reference network where all the weights are fixed to one. For this purpose, we approximate the two-subunit energy detectors by single linear units whereas the pair of weights associated to each pre-synaptic cell is replaced by a single weight \n",
      "\t\t\t\t. Using this linearization, we can project unit activations from higher levels back down to the input level, yielding an approximation of their effective RF with respect to the input. Interpreting the resulting activation as a two-dimensional distribution of mass, we compute its normalized inertial tensor \n",
      "\t\t\t\t. The two eigenvalues of \n",
      "\t\t\t\t correspond to the two principal axes of the distribution, and therefore yield a measure for the effective RF size. Comparing the optimized to the reference network, we find that the relative difference in the effective RF sizes amounts on average to −23%, −4%, +4%, +7%, and +8% for the five levels, respectively. Thus, while the optimization leads to smaller RF sizes than expected in the lower two levels, the higher levels can increase their effective RFs by converging to nonhomogeneous weight distributions.\n",
      "\t\t\tWhile early visual areas have been found to preferentially respond to simple oriented gratings, various studies have also reported a selectivity for increasingly complex shapes in subsequent levels of processing []. In the following we attempt a qualitative comparison with these results, exposing the first two levels of our model hierarchy to five simple stimuli, each composed of two bars of equal length in different spatial arrangements (see \n",
      "\t\t\t\t). For the first four stimuli, the bars are catenated to form an angle of 45°, 90°, 135°, and 180°, respectively. The fifth stimulus consists of two parallel bars. The stimuli are presented at all possible positions and 12 different orientations within the input space. For each unit, the preferred stimulus, for which it responds maximally, is determined. While the units in the first level of the hierarchy show a preference for grating-like parallel bars (68%, \n",
      "\t\t\t\t, left), the selectivity of the units at the second level is more distributed (, right). In particular, the majority of units do prefer stimuli 1–4, in which the two bars are catenated at different angles (74%). This is in accordance with experimental results, which report that cells in higher visual areas such as V2 or V4 do show an increased selectivity for curvature and corner-like shapes [,\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\tLearning-feature preferences based on a principle of optimal stability run counter to the intuition that biological systems are geared for fast reaction. However, we have to differentiate the behavioral timescale, the stability of visual features, and how fast these are processed by the sensory system. To further elucidate this distinction we investigated the dynamics of cells at the highest level with respect to a modified input stream. Visual stimuli recorded by the moving robot were related to its trajectory and place fields of the cells investigated. We cut the video stream, deleting sections where the robot was moving from an area of low average activity of a considered cell (< 25% of maximum) toward an area of high average activity (> 75% of maximum). The resulting video thus contains sudden jumps from low to high average activity of a particular cell. In \n",
      "\t\t\t\t we compare the resulting dynamics to the processing of unmodified videos. The scatter plot demonstrates that processing of rapidly changing stimuli by the network is fast, most often a few time steps only. The dynamics of the complete system is dominated by the behavioral timescale, slower by a factor of two. Thus, the system rapidly processes learned optimally stable features.\n",
      "\t\t\tFor each unit at the highest level of the hierarchy, the input frames for which the average response of the unit lies between 25% and 75% of the maximum has been removed from the input stream. Subsequently, the resulting rise time, which is the number of time steps required for a unit to traverse the interval between its 25% and 75% level of maximal response, is plotted versus the rise time under normal input conditions.

Applying this procedure to the responses of the different levels in the processing hierarchy yields a monotonically decreasing reconstruction error when moving from lower to higher levels (). In particular we find that responses of the units at the fifth level allow a highly accurate position reconstruction with an average error of 0.08 ± 0.08 (mean ± SD, in units of the length of the long side of the environment). In addition, we analyzed the spatial distribution of reconstruction errors, which shows that reconstruction is good for the central part and becomes poorer around the border of the environment (\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\tAn important property of place fields in the hippocampus is their response to changes in the environment [,\n",
      "\t\t\t\t]. For instance, it was shown by stretching a rectangular arena along its principle axes that localization and shape of place fields in rat hippocampus are controlled by the distance to the walls and surrounding landmarks []. As a comparison we perform the same manipulations using a virtual environment (A). After learning in the small square environment, the network connectivity is frozen and exposed to three test environments (B–D). We observe that the place fields depend on the robot's distance from one or more of the four surrounding walls in close analogy with the experimental data. Furthermore, three main effects with respect to the stretching of the environment can be distinguished. The place cells either keep a fixed distance to one wall, split into two subfields, or stretch along the direction the environment is stretched. The units shown in \n",

      "\t\t\t\tC is selective for a certain distance from both top and bottom walls as well as from the left wall, such that the place field is split in the vertical and stretched in the horizontal direction. These results match the properties of neurons observed in the hippocampus and suggest that optimally stable representations capture important aspects of representations in entorhinal cortex and hippocampus.\n",
      "\t\t\t(A) The virtual robot environment consists of a square arena of comparable relative size to the real-world setup and surrounding objects, e.g., a large wall along one side of the arena and a cylinder next to one of the opposite corners. This environment is stretched along either or both directions indicated by the red arrows by a factor of 1.5.(B–D) Response map of three example units that have been acquired in the original environment—small square, lower left map in (B–D)—and subsequently tested in three variants of the original environment, i.e., stretched along the vertical and/or horizontal directions. For each unit, the intensity scale of all four response maps is normalized to the maximal response of all environments.To assess the properties of cortical representations at higher stages of the visual hierarchy, such as the IT, image scrambling has been successfully used in both experimental [,\n",
      "\t\t\t\t] as well as theoretical [] studies. Here we apply this scrambling method to perform a similar analysis on our intermediate level of the hierarchy, i.e., the “landmark” cells at the third level. Those cells do qualify best for IT-like cells, not only due to their relative position within our visual hierarchy, but also because they show maximal view selectivity (B). We freeze the weights in the network after learning the real-world environment and subsequently perform four different tests with input streams spatially scrambled at four different scales (A). We observe that the average activity decreases monotonically relative to control (B), suggesting that these units are selective for complex visual features characterized at multiple spatial scales. This result is compatible with recent experimental studies [,\n",
