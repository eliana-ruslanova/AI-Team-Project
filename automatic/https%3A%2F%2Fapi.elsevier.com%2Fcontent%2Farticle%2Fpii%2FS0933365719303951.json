In this systematic review, we describe the various areas within clinical medicine that have applied the use of ML to improve patient care.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  A systematic review was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines using Medline(R), EBM Reviews, Embase, Psych Info, and Cochrane Databases, focusing on human studies that used ML to directly address a clinical problem. Included studies were published from January 1, 2000 to May 1, 2018 and provided metrics on the performance of the utilized ML tool.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  A total of 1909 unique publications were reviewed, with 378 retrospective articles and 8 prospective articles meeting inclusion criteria. Retrospective publications were found to be increasing in frequency, with 61 % of articles published within the last 4 years. Prospective articles comprised only 2 % of the articles meeting our inclusion criteria. These studies utilized a prospective cohort design with an average sample size of 531.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion\n                  The majority of literature describing the use of ML in clinical medicine is retrospective in nature and often outlines proof-of-concept approaches to impact patient care. We postulate that identifying and overcoming key translational barriers, including real-time access to clinical data, data security, physician approval of \u201cblack box\u201d generated results, and performance evaluation will allow for a fundamental shift in medical practice, where specialized tools will aid the healthcare team in providing better patient care.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial intelligence"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Machine learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Patient care"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Clinical practice"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Systematic review"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0933365719303951", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365719303951", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85077442177", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85077442177", "pubmed-id": "32143792", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077442177", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20191231", "$": "2019-12-31"}}}}, "subfield": ["Treatment", "Smart Healthcare"], "classified": ["Treatment", "Smart Healthcare"]}
