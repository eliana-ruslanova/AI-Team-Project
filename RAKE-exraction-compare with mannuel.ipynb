The main idea lies in introducing several abstraction levels that allow a step-wise identification of temporal patterns. Self-organizing neural networks are used to discover elementary patterns in the time series. Machine learning (ML) algorithms use the results of the neural networks to automatically generate a rule-based description. At the next levels, temporal grammatical rules are inferred. This method covers one of the main “bottlenecks” in the design of knowledge-based systems, namely, the knowledge acquisition problem. An evaluation of the rules lead to an overall sensitivity of 0.762, and a specificity of 0.758.\n",

The endpoint was the diagnosis of significant MR, moderate to severe, confirmed by echocardiography. We used 500 Hz ECG raw data as predictive variables.

In the 3157 non-MR individuals, those patients that the AI defined as high risk had a significantly higher chance of development of MR than the low risk group (13.9% vs. 2.6%, p < 0.001) during the follow-up period.

In nephrology, artificial intelligence can already be used to improve clinical care, hemodialysis prescriptions, and follow-up of transplant recipients. However, many nephrologists are still unfamiliar with the basic principles of medical artificial intelligence. This review seeks to provide an overview of medical artificial intelligence relevant to the practicing nephrologist, in all fields of nephrology. We define the core concepts of artificial intelligence and machine learning and cover the basics of the functioning of neural networks and deep learning. We also discuss the most recent clinical applications of artificial intelligence in nephrology and medicine; as an example, we describe how artificial intelligence can predict the occurrence of progressive immunoglobulin A nephropathy. Finally, we consider the future of artificial intelligence in clinical nephrology and its impact on medical practice, and conclude with a discussion of the ethical issues that the use of artificial intelligence raises in terms of clinical decision making, physician-patient relationship, patient privacy, and data collection.\n",

The mean area under the curve (AUC), representing the accuracy of the model, across all 300 iterations was 0.775 (95 % CI [0.767,0.782]) with a median AUC of 0.787. The positive predictive value (PPV), representing how well the model predicted SSI when a patient had SSI, over all predictions was 92.56 % with a negative predictive value (NPV), representing how well the model predicted absence of SSI when a patient did not have SSI, of 98.45 %. In analyzing relative model weights, the five highest weighted variables were Congestive Heart Failure, Chronic Pulmonary Failure, Hemiplegia/Paraplegia, Multilevel Fusion and Cerebrovascular Disease respectively. Notable factors that were protective against infection were ICU Admission, Increasing Charlson Comorbidity Score, Race (White), and being male. Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) was also determined to be mildly protective.\n",

The development of deep learning methods and in particular the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have led to substantial performance gain over the classic machine learning techniques. Multiple usages are currently being evaluated, especially for thoracic imaging, such as such as lung nodule evaluation, tuberculosis or pneumonia detection or quantification of diffuse lung diseases. Chest radiography is a near perfect domain for the development of deep learning algorithms for automatic interpretation, requiring large annotated datasets, in view of the high number of procedures and increasing data availability. Current algorithms are able to detect up to 14 common anomalies, when present as isolated findings. Chest computed tomography is another major field of application for artificial intelligence, especially in the perspective of large scale lung cancer screening. It is important for radiologists to apprehend, contribute actively and lead this new era of radiology powered by artificial intelligence. Such a perspective requires understanding new terms and concepts associated with machine learning. The objective of this paper is to provide useful definitions for understanding the methods used and their possibilities, and report current and future developments for thoracic imaging. Prospective validation of AI tools will be required before reaching routine clinical implementation.\n",

In this study, two critical predictions were explored in horses presented with acute abdomen (colic) using this technology. Those were the need for surgical intervention and survivability likelihood of affected horses based on clinical data (history, clinical examination findings, and diagnostic procedures). The two prediction parameters were explored using the application of Decision Trees, Multilayer Perceptron, Bayes Network, and Naïve Bayes. The machine learning algorithms were able to predict the need for surgery and survivability likelihood of horses presented with acute abdomen (colic) with 76% and 85% accuracy, respectively.

      "                  Molecular epidemiological studies can provide novel insights into the transmission of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. Typically, risk factors for transmission are identified using traditional hypothesis-driven statistical methods such as logistic regression. However, limitations become apparent in these approaches as the scope of these studies expand to include additional epidemiological and bacterial genomic data. Here we examine the use of Bayesian models to analyze tuberculosis epidemiology. We begin by exploring the use of Bayesian networks (BNs) to identify the distribution of tuberculosis patient attributes (including demographic and clinical attributes). Using existing algorithms for constructing BNs from observational data, we learned a BN from data about tuberculosis patients collected in San Francisco from 1991 to 1999. We verified that the resulting probabilistic models did in fact capture known statistical relationships. Next, we examine the use of newly introduced methods for representing and automatically constructing probabilistic models in structured domains. We use statistical relational models (SRMs) to model distributions over relational domains. SRMs are ideally suited to richly structured epidemiological data. We use a data-driven method to construct a statistical relational model directly from data stored in a relational database. The resulting model reveals the relationships between variables in the data and describes their distribution. We applied this procedure to the data on tuberculosis patients in San Francisco from 1991 to 1999, their Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, and data on contact investigations. The resulting statistical relational model corroborated previously reported findings and revealed several novel associations. These models illustrate the potential for this approach to reveal relationships within richly structured data that may not be apparent using conventional statistical approaches. We show that Bayesian methods, in particular statistical relational models, are an important tool for understanding infectious disease epidemiology.\n",

      "                  Large health care datasets normally have a hierarchical structure, in terms of levels, as the data have been obtained from different practices, hospitals, or regions. Multilevel regression is the technique commonly used to deal with such multilevel data. However, for the statistical analysis of interactions between entities from a domain, multilevel regression yields little to no insight. While Bayesian networks have proved to be useful for analysis of interactions, they do not have the capability to deal with hierarchical data. In this paper, we describe a new formalism, which we call multilevel Bayesian networks; its effectiveness for the analysis of hierarchically structured health care data is studied from the perspective of multimorbidity.\n",

Important advances in technology for non-invasive imaging of the eye have been made providing quantitative tools to measure structural changes in ONH topography, a crucial step in diagnosing and monitoring glaucoma.

The landmark National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated the utility of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) imaging to reduce mortality (relative to X-ray screening). As a result of the NLST and other studies, imaging-based lung cancer screening programs are now being implemented. However, LDCT interpretation results in a high number of false positives. A set of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) were designed and evaluated to provide insight into how longitudinal data can be used to help inform lung cancer screening decisions.\n",

Three of these DBNs were built using a backward construction process, and two using structure learning methods. All models employ demographics, smoking status, cancer history, family lung cancer history, exposure risk factors, comorbidities related to lung cancer, and LDCT screening outcome information. Given the uncertainty arising from lung cancer screening, a cancer state-space model based on lung cancer staging was utilized to characterize the cancer status of an individual over time. The models were evaluated on balanced training and test sets of cancer and non-cancer cases to deal with data imbalance and overfitting.\n",

In this paper, we address this deficit with a case study that demonstrates how ESNs can be trained to predict disease labels when stimulated with movement data. Since there has been relatively little prior research into using ESNs for classification, we also consider a number of different approaches for realising input–output mappings. Our results show that ESNs can carry out effective classification and are competitive with existing approaches that have significantly longer training times, in addition to performing similarly with models employing conventional feature extraction strategies that require expert domain knowledge. This suggests that ESNs may prove beneficial in situations where predictive models must be trained rapidly and without the benefit of domain knowledge, for example on high-dimensional data produced by wearable medical technologies. This application area is emphasized with a case study of Parkinson's disease patients who have been recorded by wearable sensors while performing basic movement tasks.\n",

      "                  Breast Cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer death in women, representing a very complex disease with varied molecular alterations. To assist breast cancer prognosis, the classification of patients into biological groups is of great significance for treatment strategies. Recent studies have used an ensemble of multiple clustering algorithms to elucidate the most characteristic biological groups of breast cancer. However, the combination of various clustering methods resulted in a number of patients remaining unclustered. Therefore, a framework still needs to be developed which can assign as many unclustered (i.e. biologically diverse) patients to one of the identified groups in order to improve classification. Therefore, in this paper we develop a novel classification framework which introduces a new ensemble classification stage after the ensemble clustering stage to target the unclustered patients. Thus, a step-by-step pipeline is introduced which couples ensemble clustering with ensemble classification for the identification of core groups, data distribution in them and improvement in final classification results by targeting the unclustered data. The proposed pipeline is employed on a novel real world breast cancer dataset and subsequently its robustness and stability are examined by testing it on standard datasets. The results show that by using the presented framework, an improved classification is obtained. Finally, the results have been verified using statistical tests, visualisation techniques, cluster quality assessment and interpretation from clinical experts.\n",

      "                  Medication selection for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a challenging medical decision-making problem involving multiple medications that can be prescribed to control the patient’s blood glucose. The wide range of hyperglycemia lowering agents with varying effects and various side effects makes the decision quite difficult. This paper presents computer-aided medical decision support using a fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) model that hybridizes a Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) method with a modification of Fuzzy Multi-Objective Optimization on the basis of a Ratio Analysis plus the full multiplicative form (FMULTIMOORA) method for pharmacological therapy selection of T2D. It makes the use of SWARA for obtaining the relative significance of every selected criterion by soliciting experts’ opinions and FMULTIMOORA method for evaluation of each alternative according to all criteria based on a published clinical guideline. In this paper, an extended reference point approach is considered in the proposed hybrid MCDM model that resolves the classic reference point limitations and improves the FMULTIMOORA ranking procedure. Computational results indicate that Metformin is confirmed as the first-line medication and Sulfonylurea as the second-line add-on therapy. The Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, and Insulin are placed 3rd, 4th, and 5th, respectively. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to validate the model performance by comparing its result with studies in the literature, other fuzzy MCDM techniques and an interval MULTIMOORA method based on an observational dataset. The close correspondence between the final rankings of anti-diabetic agents resulted from the proposed hybrid model and other methodologies provide significant implications for endocrinologists to refer.\n",

Moreover, such algorithms are designed for control tasks as BG adjustment and their use have increased recently in the diabetes research area, therefore we foresee RL algorithms will be used more frequently for BG control in the coming years. Furthermore, in the literature there is a lack of focus on aspects that influence BG level such as meal intakes and physical activity (PA), which should be included in the control problem. Finally, there exists a need to perform clinical validation of the algorithms.\n",

A key aspect for selecting an appropriate and adequate antimicrobial therapy is that prescription must be based on local epidemiology and knowledge since many aspects, such as prevalence of microorganisms and effectiveness of antimicrobials, change from hospitals, or even areas and services within a single hospital. Therefore, the selection of combinations of antibiotics requires the application of a methodology that provides objectivity, completeness and reproducibility to the analysis of the detailed microbiological, epidemiological, pharmacological information on which to base a rational and reasoned choice.\n",

The decision process can be defined in 4 steps: (1) selection of clinical situation of interest, (2) definition of local optimization criteria, (3) definition of constraints for reducing combinations, (4) manual sorting of solutions according to patient's clinical conditions, and (5) selection of a combination.\n",

The purpose of the model is to automate the cost-effective, non-invasive, digital pre-screening of patients at risk for dementia.\n",

Specifically, the model is trained by using structured and unstructured data from three EMR data sets: diagnosis, prescriptions, and medical notes. Each of these three data sets is used to construct an individual model along with a combined model which is derived by using all three data sets. Human-interpretable data processing and ML techniques are selected in order to facilitate adoption of the proposed model by health care providers from multiple institutions.\n",

Personalization of the system using the data of a tested subject, called local data, can be a solution, but the acquisition of sufficient local data may not be possible in real situations. Therefore, this paper proposes an effective personalizing method using small-sized local data. The proposed method utilizes a fuzzy support vector machine to allocate higher weight to the local data than to others, and a fuzzy membership is assigned to the training data by analyzing the importance of each datum. Three classification problems for a physiological signal-based driver monitoring system are introduced and utilized to validate the proposed method. The classification accuracy is compared with that of other personalizing methods, and the results show that the proposed method achieves a better accuracy on average, which is 3.46% higher than that of the simple approach using a basic support vector machine, thereby proving its effectiveness. The proposed method can train a personalized classifier with improved accuracy for a tested subject. The advantages of the proposed method can be utilized to develop a practical driver monitoring system.\n",

As a proof-of-concept, the system is able to predict type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) based on non-invasive sensors and deep neural networks.

      "                  Preventive and accurate assessment of bladder voiding dysfunctions necessitates measuring the amount of liquid encapsulated within urinary bladder walls in a non-invasive and real-time manner. The real-time monitoring of urine levels helps patients with urological disorders such as Nocturnal Enuresis (NE) by preventing the occurrence of enuresis via a pre-void stage alerting system. Although some advances have been achieved toward developing a non-invasive approach for determining the amount of accumulated urine inside the bladder, there is still a lack of an easy-to-implement technique which is suitable to embed in a wearable pre-warning device. This study aims to develop a machine-learning empowered technique to quantify to what extent an individual's bladder is filled by observing the filling-voiding pattern of a patient over a training period. In this experiment, a pulse-echo sonar element is used to generate ultrasound pulses while the probe surface is positioned perpendicular to the bladder's position. From the reflected echoes, four features which show sufficient sensitiveness and therefore could be modulated noticeably by different levels of liquid encased in the bladder, are extracted. The extracted features are then fed into a novel intelligent decision support system– known as FECOC – which is based on hybridization of fuzzy inference systems (FIS) and error correcting output codes (ECOC). The proposed scheme tends to achieve better results when examined in real case studies.\n",

Relevant information entities and direct causal dependencies, as well as uncertainty, must be formally described. Possible therapy options, tailored to the patient, can be inferred from the clinical data using these descriptions. However, there are several avoidable factors of uncertainty influencing the accuracy of the inference. For instance, inaccuracy may emerge from outdated information. In general, probabilistic models, e.g. Bayesian Networks can depict the causality and relations of individual information entities, but in general cannot evaluate individual entities concerning their up-to-dateness. The goal of the work at hand is to model diagnostic up-to-dateness, which can reasonably adjust the influence of outdated diagnostic information to improve the inference results of clinical decision models.\n",

Each diagnostic procedure involved in the decision making process of these cases was associated with a specific threshold for the time the information is considered up-to-date, i.e. reliable. Based on this threshold, outdated findings could be identified and their impact on probabilistic calculations could be reduced. We applied the model for reducing the weight of outdated patient data in the computation of TNM stagings for the 13 test cases and compared the results to the manually derived TNM stagings in the patient files.\n",

Our approach is based on a multi-context ensemble of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), aiming at learning different levels of image spatial context and improving detection performance. The main innovation behind the proposed method is the use of multiple-depth CNNs, individually trained on image patches of different dimensions and then combined together. In this way, the final ensemble is able to find and locate abnormalities on the images by exploiting both the local features and the surrounding context of a lesion. Experiments were focused on two well-known medical detection problems that have been recently faced with CNNs: microcalcification detection on full-field digital mammograms and microaneurysm detection on ocular fundus images. To this end, we used two publicly available datasets, INbreast and E-ophtha. Statistically significantly better detection performance were obtained by the proposed ensemble with respect to other approaches in the literature, demonstrating its effectiveness in the detection of small abnormalities.\n",

      "                  Computer vision systems have numerous tools to assist in various medical fields, notably in image diagnosis. Computed tomography (CT) is the principal imaging method used to assist in the diagnosis of diseases such as bone fractures, lung cancer, heart disease, and emphysema, among others. Lung cancer is one of the four main causes of death in the world. The lung regions in the CT images are marked manually by a specialist as this initial step is a significant challenge for computer vision techniques. Once defined, the lung regions are segmented for clinical diagnoses. This work proposes an automatic segmentation of the lungs in CT images, using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Mask R-CNN, to specialize the model for lung region mapping, combined with supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods (Bayes, Support Vectors Machine (SVM), K-means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)). Our approach using Mask R-CNN with the K-means kernel produced the best results for lung segmentation reaching an accuracy of 97.68 ± 3.42% and an average runtime of 11.2 s. We compared our results against other works for validation purposes, and our approach had the highest accuracy and was faster than some state-of-the-art methods.\n",

Documenting and updating medical records (75 %) and synthesizing information (54 %) were the two tasks where a majority predicted that AI/ML could fully replace human psychiatrists. Female- and US-based doctors were more uncertain that the benefits of AI would outweigh risks than male- and non-US doctors, respectively.

      "                  The most severe form of kidney disease, End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is treated with various forms of dialysis – artificial blood cleansing. Dialysis patients suffer many health burdens including high mortality and hospitalization rates, and symptomatic anemia: a low red blood cell count as indicated by a low hemoglobin (Hgb) level. ESRD-induced anemia is treated, with variable patient response, by erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs): expensive injectable medications typically administered during dialysis sessions. The dosing protocol is typically a population level protocol based on original clinical trials, the use of which often results in Hgb cycling. This cycling phenomenon occurs primarily due to the mismatch in the time between dosing decisions and the time it takes for the effects of a dosing change to be fully realized. In this paper we develop a recurrent neural network approach that uses historic data together with future ESA and iron dosing data to predict the 1, 2, and 3 month Hgb levels of patients with ESRD-induced anemia. The results of extensive experimentation indicate that this approach generates predictions that are clinically relevant: the mean absolute error of the predictions is comparable to estimates of the intra-individual variability of the laboratory test for Hgb.\n",

      "                  Antibiotic resistance is one of the major challenges we face in modern times. Antibiotic use, especially their overuse, is the single most important driver of antibiotic resistance. Efforts have been made to reduce unnecessary drug prescriptions, but limited work is devoted to optimising dosage regimes when they are prescribed. The design of antibiotic treatments can be formulated as an optimisation problem where candidate solutions are encoded as vectors of dosages per day. The formulation naturally gives rise to competing objectives, as we want to maximise the treatment effectiveness while minimising the total drug use, the treatment duration and the concentration of antibiotic experienced by the patient. This article combines a recent mathematical model of bacterial growth including both susceptible and resistant bacteria, with a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm in order to automatically design successful antibiotic treatments. We consider alternative formulations combining relevant objectives and constraints. Our approach obtains shorter treatments, with improved success rates and smaller amounts of drug than the standard practice of administering daily fixed doses. These new treatments consistently involve a higher initial dose followed by lower tapered doses.\n",

Unfortunately, individual institutions often lack sufficient samples, which might not provide sufficient statistical power for models. One mitigation is to expand data collection from a single institution to multiple centers to collectively increase the sample size. However, sharing sensitive biomedical data for research involves complicated issues. Machine learning models such as random forests (RF), though they are commonly used and achieve good performances for prognostic prediction, usually suffer worse performance under multicenter privacy-preserving data mining scenarios compared to a centrally trained version.\n",

By using a novel data enhancement approach based on a differentially private generative adversarial network customized to clinical prognosis data, the proposed model is able to provide a multicenter RF model with performances on par with—or even better than—centrally trained RF but without the need to aggregate the raw data. Moreover, our model also incorporates an importance ranking step designed for feature selection without sharing patient-level information.\n",

Then, we compare the discrimination and calibration ability of the proposed multicenter random forest with a centrally trained random forest model and other tree-based classifiers as well as some commonly used machine learning methods. The results show that the proposed model can provide better prediction performance in terms of discrimination and calibration ability than the centrally trained RF model or the other candidate models while following the privacy-preserving rules in both groups. Additionally, good discrimination and calibration ability are shown on the simplified model based on the feature importance ranking in the proposed approach.\n",

In this article, the author investigates and discusses three aspects of AI in medicine and healthcare: the application and promises of AI, special ethical concerns pertaining to AI in some frontier fields, and suggestive ethical governance systems. Despite great potentials of frontier AI research and development in the field of medical care, the ethical challenges induced by its applications has put forward new requirements for governance. To ensure “trustworthy” AI applications in healthcare and medicine, the creation of an ethical global governance framework and system as well as special guidelines for frontier AI applications in medicine are suggested. The most important aspects include the roles of governments in ethical auditing and the responsibilities of stakeholders in the ethical governance system.\n",

      "                  Artificial Intelligence (AI) reflects the intelligence exhibited by machines and software. It is a highly desirable academic field of many current fields of studies. Leading AI researchers describe the field as “the study and design of intelligent agents”. McCarthy invented this term in 1955 and defined it as “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines”. The central goals of AI research are reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, natural language processing (communication), perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects. In fact the multidisplinary AI field is considered to be rather interdisciplinary covering numerous number of sciences and professions, including computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy and neurosciences. The field was founded on the claim that a central intellectual property of humans, intelligence-the sapience of Homo Sapiens “can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it”. This raises philosophical issues about the nature of the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence. Artificial Intelligence has been the subject of tremendous optimism but has also suffered stunning setbacks.\n",
      "                  The goal of this narrative is to review the potential use of AI approaches and their integration into pediatric cellular therapies and regenerative medicine. Emphasis is placed on recognition and application of AI techniques in the development of predictive models for personalized treatments with engineered stem cells, immune cells and regenerated tissues in adults and children. These intelligent machines could dissect the whole genome and isolate the immune particularities of individual patient’s disease in a matter of minutes and create the treatment that is customized to patient’s genetic specificity and immune system capability. AI techniques could be used for optimization of clinical trials of innovative stem cell and gene therapies in pediatric patients by precise planning of treatments, predicting clinical outcomes, simplifying recruitment and retention of patients, learning from input data and applying to new data, thus lowering their complexity and costs. Complementing human intelligence with machine intelligence could have an exponentially high impact on continual progress in many fields of pediatrics. However how long before we could see the real impact still remains the big question. The most pertinent question that remains to be answered therefore, is can AI effectively and accurately predict properties of newer DDR strategies?\n",

      "                  The domain of healthcare has always been flooded with a huge amount of complex data, coming in at a very fast-pace. A vast amount of data is generated in different sectors of healthcare industry: data from hospitals and healthcare providers, medical insurance, medical equipment, life sciences and medical research. With the advancement in technology, there is a huge potential for utilization of this data for transforming healthcare. The application of analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence over big data enables identification of patterns and correlations and hence provides actionable insights for improving the delivery of healthcare. There have been many contributions to the literature in this topic, but we lack a comprehensive view of the current state of research and application. This paper focuses on assessing the available literature in order to provide the researchers with evidence that enable fostering further development in this area. A systematic mapping study was conducted to identify and analyze research on big data analytics and artificial intelligence in healthcare, in which 2421 articles between 2013 and February 2019 were evaluated. The results of this study will help understand the needs in application of these technologies in healthcare by identifying the areas that require additional research. It will hence provide the researchers and industry experts with a base for future work.\n",

This review first covers the early work regarding AI in medicine, then aims to elucidate some of the most current applications of machine learning in medicine according to the following four specific categories: (1) its use in assessing the risk of disease onset and in estimating treatment success; (2) its use in managing or alleviating complications; (3) its role in ongoing patient care; and (4) its use in ongoing pathology and treatment efficacy research. Lastly, this paper clarifies some of the potential drawbacks, concerns, and uncertainties surrounding the use of AI in medicine and briefly discusses some of the efforts being made to prepare the health care industry for the implementation of AI.\n",
