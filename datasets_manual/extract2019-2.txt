Considering gene expressions are usually highly correlated in humans, the expression values of the remaining target genes can be predicted by analyzing the values of 943 landmark genes. Hence, we designed an algorithm for predicting gene expression values based on XGBoost, which integrates multiple tree models and has stronger interpretability. We tested the performance of XGBoost model on the GEO dataset and RNA-seq dataset and compared the result with other existing models. Experiments showed that the XGBoost model achieved a significantly lower overall error than the existing D-GEX algorithm, linear regression, and KNN methods. In conclusion, the XGBoost algorithm outperforms existing models and will be a significant contribution to the toolbox for gene expression value prediction.

10.3390/brainsci9080194  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Statistics plays three important roles in brain studies. They are (1) the study of differences between brains in distinctive populations; (2) the study of the variability in the structure and functioning of the brain; and (3) the study of data reduction on large-scale brain data. I discuss these concepts using examples from past and ongoing research in brain connectivity, brain information flow, information extraction from large-scale neuroimaging data, and neural predictive modeling. Having dispensed with the past, I attempt to present a few areas where statistical science facilitates brain decoding and to write prospectively, in the light of present knowledge and in the quest for artificial intelligence, about questions that statistical and neurobiological communities could work closely together to address in the future.

10.3389/fcell.2019.00349  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Modern molecular high-throughput devices, e.g., next-generation sequencing, have transformed medical research. Resulting data sets are usually high-dimensional on a genomic-scale providing multi-factorial information from intertwined molecular and cellular activities of genes and their products. This genomics-revolution installed precision medicine offering breathtaking opportunities for patient's diagnosis and treatment. However, due to the speed of these developments the quality standards of the involved data analyses are lacking behind, as exemplified by the infamous Duke Saga. In this paper, we argue in favor of a two-stage cooperative serve model that couples data generation and data analysis in the most beneficial way from the perspective of a patient to ensure data analysis quality standards including reproducible research.

10.1109/JBHI.2019.2919916  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The dental disease is a common disease for a human. Screening and visual diagnosis that are currently performed in clinics possibly cost a lot in various manners. Along with the progress of the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence, the internet-based intelligent system have shown great potential in applying home-based healthcare. Therefore, a smart dental health-IoT system based on intelligent hardware, deep learning, and mobile terminal is proposed in this paper, aiming at exploring the feasibility of its application on in-home dental healthcare. Moreover, a smart dental device is designed and developed in this study to perform the image acquisition of teeth. Based on the data set of 12 600 clinical images collected by the proposed device from 10 private dental clinics, an automatic diagnosis model trained by MASK R-CNN is developed for the detection and classification of 7 different dental diseases including decayed tooth, dental plaque, uorosis, and periodontal disease, with the diagnosis accuracy of them reaching up to 90%, along with high sensitivity and high specificity. Following the one-month test in ten clinics, compared with that last month when the platform was not used, the mean diagnosis time reduces by 37.5% for each patient, helping explain the increase in the number of treated patients by 18.4%. Furthermore, application software (APPs) on mobile terminal for client side and for dentist side are implemented to provide service of pre-examination, consultation, appointment, and evaluation.

They are powerful tools for large scale data analysis, prediction and classification, especially in very data-rich environments ("big data"), and have started to find their way into medical applications. Here we will first give an overview of machine learning methods, with a focus on deep and recurrent neural networks, their relation to statistics, and the core principles behind them. We will then discuss and review directions along which (deep) neural networks can be, or already have been, applied in the context of psychiatry, and will try to delineate their future potential in this area. We will also comment on an emerging area that so far has been much less well explored: by embedding semantically interpretable computational models of brain dynamics or behavior into a statistical machine learning context, insights into dysfunction beyond mere prediction and classification may be gained. Especially this marriage of computational models with statistical inference may offer insights into neural and behavioral mechanisms that could open completely novel avenues for psychiatric treatment.

High-throughput technologies (HTTs) are found in life- and materials-science laboratories. Although HTTs have long been the standard in life sciences in academia as well as in industry, HTTs in materials science have become the standard in industry but not in academia. In life science, successful drugs developed with HTTs have been reported, but there is no information on successful materials developed with HTTs that have made it to the market. Some initial development of HTTs in materials science is summarized, especially early applications of artificial intelligence. This outlook attempts to summarize the development of combinatorial materials sciences from the early years to today.

10.3390/s19040753  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   High detection accuracy in piezoelectric-based force sensing in interactive displays has gained global attention. To achieve this, artificial neural networks (ANN)-successful and widely used machine learning algorithms-have been demonstrated to be potentially powerful tools, providing acceptable location detection accuracy of 95.2% and force level recognition of 93.3% in a previous study. While these values might be acceptable for conventional operations, e.g., opening a folder, they must be boosted for applications where intensive operations are performed. Furthermore, the relatively high computational cost reported prevents the popularity of ANN-based techniques in conventional artificial intelligence (AI) chip-free end-terminals. In this article, an ANN is designed and optimized for piezoelectric-based touch panels in interactive displays for the first time. The presented technique experimentally allows a conventional smart device to work smoothly with a high detection accuracy of above 97% for both location and force level detection with a low computational cost, thereby advancing the user experience, and serviced by piezoelectric-based touch interfaces in displays.

10.1007/s11948-019-00084-5  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   This paper examines the ethical pitfalls and challenges that non-ethicists, such as researchers and programmers in the fields of computer science, artificial intelligence and robotics, face when building moral machines. Whether ethics is "computable" depends on how programmers understand ethics in the first place and on the adequacy of their understanding of the ethical problems and methodological challenges in these fields. Researchers and programmers face at least two types of problems due to their general lack of ethical knowledge or expertise. The first type is so-called rookie mistakes, which could be addressed by providing these people with the necessary ethical knowledge. The second, more difficult methodological issue concerns areas of peer disagreement in ethics, where no easy solutions are currently available. This paper examines several existing approaches to highlight the ethical pitfalls and challenges involved. Familiarity with these and similar problems can help programmers to avoid pitfalls and build better moral machines. The paper concludes that ethical decisions regarding moral robots should be based on avoiding what is immoral (i.e. prohibiting certain immoral actions) in combination with a pluralistic ethical method of solving moral problems, rather than relying on a particular ethical approach, so as to avoid a normative bias.

10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.213902  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Optical chirality occurs when materials interact differently with light in a specific circular polarization state. Chiroptical phenomena inspire wide interdisciplinary investigations, which require advanced designs to reach strong chirality for practical applications. The development of artificial intelligence provides a new vision for the manipulation of light-matter interaction beyond the theoretical interpretation. Here, we report a self-consistent framework named the Bayesian optimization and convolutional neural network that combines Bayesian optimization and deep convolutional neural network algorithms to calculate and optimize optical properties of metallic nanostructures. Both electric-field distributions at the near field and reflection spectra at the far field are calculated and self-learned to suggest better structure designs and provide possible explanations for the origin of the optimized properties, which enables wide applications for future nanostructure analysis and design.

10.1093/bioinformatics/bty511  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Motivation:  Understanding the mutational processes that act during cancer development is a key topic of cancer biology. Nevertheless, much remains to be learned, as a complex interplay of processes with dependencies on a range of genomic features creates highly heterogeneous cancer genomes. Accurate driver detection relies on unbiased models of the mutation rate that also capture rate variation from uncharacterized sources. 
  Results:  Here, we analyse patterns of observed-to-expected mutation counts across 505 whole cancer genomes, and find that genomic features missing from our mutation-rate model likely operate on a megabase length scale. We extend our site-specific model of the mutation rate to include the additional variance from these sources, which leads to robust significance evaluation of candidate cancer drivers. We thus present ncdDetect v.2, with greatly improved cancer driver detection specificity. Finally, we show that ranking candidates by their posterior mean value of their effect sizes offers an equivalent and more computationally efficient alternative to ranking by their P-values.

10.1177/0962280218805780  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Stochastic transmission dynamic models are needed to quantify the uncertainty in estimates and predictions during outbreaks of infectious diseases. We previously developed a calibration method for stochastic epidemic compartmental models, called Multiple Shooting for Stochastic Systems (MSS), and demonstrated its competitive performance against a number of existing state-of-the-art calibration methods. The existing MSS method, however, lacks a mechanism against filter degeneracy, a phenomenon that results in parameter posterior distributions that are weighted heavily around a single value. As such, when filter degeneracy occurs, the posterior distributions of parameter estimates will not yield reliable credible or prediction intervals for parameter estimates and predictions. In this work, we extend the MSS method by evaluating and incorporating two resampling techniques to detect and resolve filter degeneracy. Using simulation experiments, we demonstrate that an extended MSS method produces credible and prediction intervals with desired coverage in estimating key epidemic parameters (e.g. mean duration of infectiousness and <i>R</i><sub>0</sub>) and short- and long-term predictions (e.g. one and three-week forecasts, timing and number of cases at the epidemic peak, and final epidemic size). Applying the extended MSS approach to a humidity-based stochastic compartmental influenza model, we were able to accurately predict influenza-like illness activity reported by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 10 regions as well as city-level influenza activity using real-time, city-specific Google search query data from 119 U.S. cities between 2003 and 2014.

10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007342  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Stochastic mechanistic epidemiological models largely contribute to better understand pathogen emergence and spread, and assess control strategies at various scales (from within-host to transnational scale). However, developing realistic models which involve multi-disciplinary knowledge integration faces three major challenges in predictive epidemiology: lack of readability once translated into simulation code, low reproducibility and reusability, and long development time compared to outbreak time scale. We introduce here EMULSION, an artificial intelligence-based software intended to address those issues and help modellers focus on model design rather than programming. EMULSION defines a domain-specific language to make all components of an epidemiological model (structure, processes, parameters…) explicit as a structured text file. This file is readable by scientists from other fields (epidemiologists, biologists, economists), who can contribute to validate or revise assumptions at any stage of model development. It is then automatically processed by EMULSION generic simulation engine, preventing any discrepancy between model description and implementation. The modelling language and simulation architecture both rely on the combination of advanced artificial intelligence methods (knowledge representation and multi-level agent-based simulation), allowing several modelling paradigms (from compartment- to individual-based models) at several scales (up to metapopulation). The flexibility of EMULSION and its capability to support iterative modelling are illustrated here through examples of progressive complexity, including late revisions of core model assumptions. EMULSION is also currently used to model the spread of several diseases in real pathosystems. EMULSION provides a command-line tool for checking models, producing model diagrams, running simulations, and plotting outputs. Written in Python 3, EMULSION runs on Linux, MacOS, and Windows. It is released under Apache-2.0 license. A comprehensive documentation with installation instructions, a tutorial and many examples are available from: https://sourcesup.renater.fr/www/emulsion-public.

10.1093/bioinformatics/bty1035  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Motivation:  Accurate and wide-ranging prediction of thermodynamic parameters for biochemical reactions can facilitate deeper insights into the workings and the design of metabolic systems. 
  Results:  Here, we introduce a machine learning method with chemical fingerprint-based features for the prediction of the Gibbs free energy of biochemical reactions. From a large pool of 2D fingerprint-based features, this method systematically selects a small number of relevant ones and uses them to construct a regularized linear model. Since a manual selection of 2D structure-based features can be a tedious and time-consuming task, requiring expert knowledge about the structure-activity relationship of chemical compounds, the systematic feature selection step in our method offers a convenient means to identify relevant 2D fingerprint-based features. By comparing our method with state-of-the-art linear regression-based methods for the standard Gibbs free energy prediction, we demonstrated that its prediction accuracy and prediction coverage are most favorable. Our results show direct evidence that a number of 2D fingerprints collectively provide useful information about the Gibbs free energy of biochemical reactions and that our systematic feature selection procedure provides a convenient way to identify them.

10.1007/s10620-019-05791-4  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Video capsule endoscopy became a reality in 2001. This device enabled us to directly view the mucosa of the small intestine for the first time. The main indications for the video capsule remain the detection of small intestinal bleeding and iron deficiency anemia, diagnosis and management of Crohn's disease, and detection of tumors. The device is extraordinarily safe and can be used in the very young to the very old. However, there remain several areas of controversy and difficulty. These are covered in this article and include details of indications and contraindications, whether to prepare patients, whether or not to use simethicone and prokinetics. Detection of location of the capsule remains a major engineering challenge. Reading the videos reliably and quickly remains challenging. However, artificial intelligence and machine learning are already on the horizon to provide assistance. New uses for capsule endoscopy promise more accurate diagnosis and hence improved management of acute gastrointestinal bleeding. The colon capsule may eventually help those who refuse conventional colonoscopy, and robotically controlled capsules may be helpful in screening for serious disease in patients with upper abdominal complaints. The advent of the broadening use of video capsule endoscopy is, though it will be controversial, embraced by some and derided by others; such is the nature of technological development. In the long run, if the use of the video capsule, based on sound evidence-based studies, can be shown to improve the care of our patients and reduce the cost of health care, its use will continue to expand.

One of the most rapidly evolving modalities is artificial intelligence with recent studies providing real-time diagnoses and encouraging results in the first randomised trials to conventional endoscopic imaging. Advances in functional hypoxia imaging offer novel opportunities to be used to detect neoplasia and the assessment of colitis. Three-dimensional volumetric imaging provides spatial information and has shown promise in the increased detection of small polyps. Studies to date of self-propelling colonoscopes demonstrate an increased caecal intubation rate and possibly offer patients a more comfortable procedure. Further development in robotic technology has introduced ex vivo automated locomotor upper gastrointestinal and small bowel capsule devices. Eye-tracking has the potential to revolutionise endoscopic training through the identification of differences in experts and non-expert endoscopist as trainable parameters. In this review, we discuss the latest innovations of all these technologies and provide perspective into the exciting future of diagnostic luminal endoscopy.

In this review, we explore the evolution and background of Computer Assisted Orthopaedic Surgery (CAOS), delving into the basic principles behind the technology and the changes in the discussion on the subject throughout the years and the impact these discussions had on the field. We found evidence that industry had an important role in driving the discussion at least in knee arthroplasty-a leading field of CAOS-with the ratio between patents and publications increased from approximately 1:10 in 2004 to almost 1:3 in 2014. The adoption of CAOS is largely restrained by economics and ergonomics with sceptics challenging the accuracy and precision of navigation during the early years of CAOS moving to patient functional improvements and long term survivorship. Nevertheless, the future of CAOS remains positive with the prospect of new technologies such as improvements in image-guided surgery, enhanced navigation systems, robotics and artificial intelligence.

Although crowding is a ubiquitous phenomenon, since elements are rarely seen in isolation, to date there exists no consensus on how to model it. Previous experiments showed that the global configuration of the entire stimulus must be taken into account. These findings rule out simple pooling or substitution models and favor models sensitive to global spatial aspects. In order to investigate how to incorporate global aspects into models, we tested a large number of models with a database of forty stimuli tailored for the global aspects of crowding. Our results show that incorporating grouping like components strongly improves model performance.

10.3390/s19010125  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   In the era of the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence, the Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based indoor positioning system (IPS) has been recognized as the most promising IPS for various applications. Fingerprinting-based algorithms critically rely on a fingerprint database built from machine learning methods. However, currently methods are based on single-feature Received Signal Strength (RSS), which is extremely unstable in performance in terms of precision and robustness. The reason for this is that single feature machines cannot capture the complete channel characteristics and are susceptible to interference. The objective of this paper is to exploit the Time of Arrival (TOA) feature and propose a heterogeneous features fusion model to enhance the precision and robustness of indoor positioning. Several challenges are addressed: (1) machine learning models based on heterogeneous features, (2) the optimization of algorithms for high precision and robustness, and (3) computational complexity. This paper provides several heterogeneous features fusion-based localization models. Their effectiveness and efficiency are thoroughly compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Even based on a small 2D materials data set, we can fundamentally approach an accurate and rational model about the band gap and exciton binding energy with robust transferability to other databases. Our machine learning outputs can reveal the exact physics pictures behind the predicted quantity as well as the "secondary understanding" of the correlation between the approximated physics models in exciton. This work stresses the significant value of physics endorsement on the machine learning (ML) algorithm and provides a symbolic regression solution for the "few-shot" training scheme for ML technology in materials science. Moreover, physics-inspired secondary understanding could be an essential supplement for ML in scientific research fields.

The current research was designed to evaluate the fungicidal action of <i>S persica</i> aquatic root extract in terms of radial growth rate and inhibition zone (IZO) versus 3 pathogenic <i>Aspergillus</i> species, namely, <i>A nige</i>r, <i>A flavus</i>, and <i>A fumigatus</i> in vitro. The results revealed that the plant extract (50 and 100 mg/mL) exhibited a prohibiting influence on the growth of the tested fungal species. The high concentration (100 mg/mL) of the plant extract <i>was</i> efficient in prohibiting the growing rate of the tested <i>Aspergillus</i> species after 6 days exposure period. <i>Aspergillus niger</i> and <i>A flavus</i> showed the largest inhibition ratios (60% and 54.4%, respectively) and IZO (33.00 ± 0.05 mm and 25.50 ± 0.18 mm, respectively) versus the control counterparts. <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> showed the minimum inhibition ratio (39%) and IZO (20.31 ± 0.05). The present data showed that the extract of <i>S persica</i> possesses potential fungicidal influence versus the tested pathogenic <i>Aspergillus</i> species and this may support the utilization of this extract as a promising antifungal agent versus aspergillosis.

Both positive and negative aspects of the learning methods are presented. 
  Results and conclusion:  The fundamental objectives of teaching and learning remain unchanged, yet the opportunities to reach larger audiences and integrate their learning into active experiences are evolving due to the introduction of new teaching and learning methodologies. The ability to reach a global audience has never been more apparent. Nevertheless, as much as new technology can be alluring, each new method comes with unique limitations.

10.12701/yujm.2019.00206  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Medical education research subjects are incredibly diverse and have changed over time. This work in particular aims to compare and analyze research trends in medical education through the words used in the titles of these research papers. Academic Medicine (the journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges), Medical Teacher (the journal of the Association of Medical Education in Europe), the Korean Journal of Medical Education (KJME), and Korean Medical Education Review (KMER) were selected and analyzed for the purposes of this research. From 2009 to 2018, Academic Medicine and Medical Teacher published approximately 10 to 20 times more papers than the KJME and KMER. Frequently used words in these titles include "medical," "student," "education," and "learning." The words "clinical" and "learning" were used relatively often (7.80% to 13.66%) in Korean journals and Medical Teacher, but Academic Medicine used these phrases relatively less often (6.47% and 4.41%, respectively). Concern with such various topics as problem-based learning, team-based learning, program evaluations, burnout, e-learning, and digital indicates that Medical Teacher seems to primarily deal with teaching and learning methodologies, and Academic Medicine handles all aspects of medical education. The KJME and KMER did not cover all subjects, as they publish smaller papers. However, it is anticipated that research on new subjects, such as artificial intelligence in medical education, will occur in the near future.

10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.260501  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   We report on the experimental measurement of the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between two two-qubit states by many-particle interference. We demonstrate that our three-step method for measuring distances in the Hilbert space is far less complex than reconstructing density matrices and that it can be applied in quantum-enhanced machine learning to reduce the complexity of calculating Euclidean distances between multidimensional points, which can be especially interesting for near term quantum technologies and quantum artificial intelligence research. Our results are also a novel example of applying mixed states in quantum information processing. Usually working with mixed states is undesired, but here it gives the possibility of encoding extra information as the degree of coherence between the given two dimensions of the density matrix.

10.1186/s12911-019-0980-z  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Clinical Named Entity Recognition is to find the name of diseases, body parts and other related terms from the given text. Because Chinese language is quite different with English language, the machine cannot simply get the graphical and phonetic information form Chinese characters. The method for Chinese should be different from that for English. Chinese characters present abundant information with the graphical features, recent research on Chinese word embedding tries to use graphical information as subword. This paper uses both graphical and phonetic features to improve Chinese Clinical Named Entity Recognition based on the presence of phono-semantic characters. 
  Methods:  This paper proposed three different embedding models and tested them on the annotated data. The data have been divided into two sections for exploring the effect of the proportion of phono-semantic characters. 
  Results:  The model using primary radical and pinyin can improve Clinical Named Entity Recognition in Chinese and get the F-measure of 0.712. More phono-semantic characters does not give a better result. 
  Conclusions:  The paper proves that the use of the combination of graphical and phonetic features can improve the Clinical Named Entity Recognition in Chinese.

10.1109/TNB.2019.2919188  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   It is crucial for doctors to fully understand the interaction between drugs in prescriptions, especially when a patient takes multiple medications at the same time during treatment. The purpose of drug drug interaction (DDI) extraction is to automatically obtain the interaction between drugs from biomedical literature. Current state-of-the-art approaches for DDI extraction task are based on artificial intelligence and natural language processing. While such existing DDI extraction methods can provide more knowledge and enhance the performance through external resources such as biomedical databases or ontologies, due to the difficulty of updating, these external resources are delayed. In fact, user generated content (UGC) is another kind of external medical resources that can be quickly updated. We are trying to use UGC resources to provide more available information for our deep learning DDI extraction method. In this paper, we present a DDI extraction approach through a new attention mechanism called full-attention which can combine the UGC information with contextual information. We conducted a series of experiments on the DDI 2013 Evaluation dataset to evaluate our method. Experiments show improved performance compared with the state of the art and UGC-DDI model achieves a competitive F-score of 0.712.

10.3389/fgene.2019.01182  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The microbiome-wide association studies are to figure out the relationship between microorganisms and humans, with the goal of discovering relevant biomarkers to guide disease diagnosis. However, the microbiome data is complex, with high noise and dimensions. Traditional machine learning methods are limited by the models' representation ability and cannot learn complex patterns from the data. Recently, deep learning has been widely applied to fields ranging from text processing to image recognition due to its efficient flexibility and high capacity. But the deep learning models must be trained with enough data in order to achieve good performance, which is impractical in reality. In addition, deep learning is considered as black box and hard to interpret. These factors make deep learning not widely used in microbiome-wide association studies. In this work, we construct a sparse microbial interaction network and embed this graph into deep model to alleviate the risk of overfitting and improve the performance. Further, we explore a Graph Embedding Deep Feedforward Network (GEDFN) to conduct feature selection and guide meaningful microbial markers' identification. Based on the experimental results, we verify the feasibility of combining the microbial graph model with the deep learning model, and demonstrate the feasibility of applying deep learning and feature selection on microbial data. Our main contributions are: firstly, we utilize different methods to construct a variety of microbial interaction networks and combine the network <i>via</i> graph embedding deep learning. Secondly, we introduce a feature selection method based on graph embedding and validate the biological meaning of microbial markers. The code is available at https://github.com/MicroAVA/GEDFN.git.

Previous studies usually equated filter bubbles with community structures and emphasized this exogenous isolation effect, but there is a lack of full discussion of the internal organization of filter bubbles. Here, we design an experiment for analysing filter bubbles taking advantage of social bots. We deployed 128 bots to Weibo (the largest microblogging network in China), and each bot consumed a specific topic (entertainment or sci-tech) and ran for at least two months. In total, we recorded about 1.3 million messages exposed to these bots and their social networks. By analysing the text received by the bots and motifs in their social networks, we found that a filter bubble is not only a dense community of users with the same preferences but also presents an endogenetic unidirectional star-like structure. The structure could spontaneously exclude non-preferred information and cause polarization. Moreover, our work proved that the felicitous use of artificial intelligence technology could provide a useful experimental approach that combines privacy protection and controllability in studying social media.

About 80% of the aging population will be in the developing countries. Aging population may suffer from various physical, cognitive, and social problems, due to aging process such as impairment of physical related functions (decreased mobility and walking speed, falls, frailty, decreased walking speed, difficulties in basic, and instrumental activities of daily living), cognitive related functions (memory-related issues), sensory functions (hearing loss, cataracts and refractive errors, presbyopia, decreased vestibular function), behavioural and psychological disorders, social isolation issues, and poor quality of life. Over the period of the last few decades, emerging technologies such as internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), sensors, cloud computing, wireless communication technologies, and assistive robotics have given the vision to develop various ambient or active assisted living (AAL) approaches for supporting an elderly people to live safely and independently in their living environment and participate in their daily and community activities, as well as supporting them to maintain their physical, mental health, and quality of their life. The aim of this paper is to review the use of Ambient or Active Assisted Living for older adults with physical, cognitive impairments, and their social participation.

Therefore, it is important and necessary to evaluate the functional relationship of miRNAs and then predict novel miRNA-disease associations. For this purpose, here we developed the updated web server MISIM (miRNA similarity) v2.0. Besides a 3-fold increase in data content compared with MISIM v1.0, MISIM v2.0 improved the original MISIM algorithm by implementing both positive and negative miRNA-disease associations. That is, the MISIM v2.0 scores could be positive or negative, whereas MISIM v1.0 only produced positive scores. Moreover, MISIM v2.0 achieved an algorithm for novel miRNA-disease prediction based on MISIM v2.0 scores. Finally, MISIM v2.0 provided network visualization and functional enrichment analysis for functionally paired miRNAs. The MISIM v2.0 web server is freely accessible at http://www.lirmed.com/misim/.

10.1109/JBHI.2019.2923773  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Salivary gland ultrasonography (SGUS) has shown good potential in the diagnosis of primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). However, a series of international studies have reported needs for improvements of the existing pSS scoring procedures in terms of inter/intra observer reliability before being established as standardized diagnostic tools. The present study aims to solve this problem by employing radiomics features and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to make the pSS scoring more objective and faster compared to human expert scoring. The assessment of AI algorithms was performed on a two-centric cohort, which included 600 SGUS images (150 patients) annotated using the original SGUS scoring system proposed in 1992 for pSS. For each image, we extracted 907 histogram-based and descriptive statistics features from segmented salivary glands. Optimal feature subsets were found using the genetic algorithm based wrapper approach. Among the considered algorithms (seven classifiers and five regressors), the best preforming was the multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier (κ = 0.7). The MLP over-performed average score achieved by the clinicians (κ = 0.67) by the considerable margin, whereas its reliability was on the level of human intra-observer variability (κ = 0.71). The presented findings indicate that the continuously increasing HarmonicSS cohort will enable further advancements in AI-based pSS scoring methods by SGUS. In turn, this may establish SGUS as an effective noninvasive pSS diagnostic tool, with the final goal to supplement current diagnostic tests.

10.3389/fnhum.2019.00170  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Japanese martial arts, <i>Budo</i>, have been reported to improve cognitive function, especially attention. However, the underlying neural mechanisms of the effect of <i>Budo</i> on attention processing has not yet been investigated. <i>Kendo</i>, a type of fencing using bamboo swords, is one of the most popular forms of <i>Budo</i> worldwide. We investigated the difference in functional connectivity (FC) between <i>Kendo</i> players (KPs) and non-KPs (NKPs) during an attention-related auditory oddball paradigm and during rest. The analyses focused on the brain network related to "motivation." Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and task-based fMRI using the oddball paradigm were performed in healthy male volunteers (14 KPs and 11 NKPs). Group differences in FC were tested using CONN-software within the motivation network, which consisted of 22 brain regions defined by a previous response-conflict task-based fMRI study with a reward cue. Daily general physical activities were assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). We also investigated the impact of major confounders, namely, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, IPAQ score, body mass index (BMI), and reaction time (RT) in the oddball paradigm. Resting-state fMRI revealed that KPs had a significantly lower FC than NKPs between the right nucleus accumbens and right frontal eye field (FEF) within the motivation network. Conversely, KPs exhibited a significantly higher FC than NKPs between the left intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and the left precentral gyrus (PCG) within the network during the auditory oddball paradigm [statistical thresholds, False Discovery Rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05]. These results remained significant after controlling for major covariates. Our results suggest that attenuated motivation network integrity at rest together with enhanced motivation network integrity during attentional demands might underlie the instantaneous concentration abilities of KPs.

First, we briefly explore the historical evidence using film-screen mammography, before providing an in-depth description of evidence using digital mammography. We classify studies according to which exact version of double reading they use, because the evidence suggests that effectiveness of double reading is contingent on whether the two radiologists are blinded to one another's decisions, and how the decisions of the two radiologists are integrated. Finally, we explore the implications for future mammography, including using artificial intelligence as the second reader, and applications to more complex three-dimensional imaging techniques such as tomosynthesis.

10.3390/s19112525  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been attracted lots of interests over the recent years, due to its applicability across the various domains. In particular, an IoT-based robot with artificial intelligence may be utilized in various fields of surveillance. In this paper, we propose an IoT platform with an intelligent surveillance robot using machine learning in order to overcome the limitations of the existing closed-circuit television (CCTV) which is installed fixed type. The IoT platform with a surveillance robot provides the smart monitoring as a role of active CCTV. The intelligent surveillance robot, which has been built with its own IoT server, and can carry out line tracing and acquire contextual information through the sensors to detect abnormal status in an environment. In addition, photos taken by its camera can be compared with stored images of normal state. If an abnormal status is detected, the manager receives an alarm via a smart phone. For user convenience, the client is provided with an app to control the robot remotely. In the case of image context processing it is useful to apply convolutional neural network (CNN)-based machine learning (ML), which is introduced for the precise detection and recognition of images or patterns, and from which can be expected a high performance of recognition. We designed the CNN model to support contextually-aware services of the IoT platform and to perform experiments for learning accuracy of the designed CNN model using dataset of images acquired from the robot. Experimental results showed that the accuracy of learning is over 0.98, which means that we achieved enhanced learning in image context recognition. The contribution of this paper is not only to implement an IoT platform with active CCTV robot but also to construct a CNN model for image-and-context-aware learning and intelligence enhancement of the proposed IoT platform. The proposed IoT platform, with an intelligent surveillance robot using machine learning, can be used to detect abnormal status in various industrial fields such as factory, smart farms, logistics warehouses, and public places.

An intuitive control method should retain an adequate level of functionality for dexterous operation, provide robustness against confounding factors, and supply adaptability for diverse long-term usage, all of which are current problems being tackled by researchers. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art, as well as, the limitations of current myoelectric signal control (MSC) methods. To address the research topic on functionality, we review different approaches to prosthetic hand control (DOF configuration, discrete or simultaneous, etc.), and how well the control is performed (accuracy, response, intuitiveness, etc.). To address the research on robustness, we review the confounding factors (limb positions, electrode shift, force variance, and inadvertent activity) that affect the stability of the control performance. Lastly, to address adaptability, we review the strategies that can automatically adjust the classifier for different individuals and for long-term usage. This review provides a thorough overview of the current MSC methods and helps highlight the current areas of research focus and resulting clinic usability for the MSC methods for upper-limb prostheses.

There has been increasing interest in being able to predict an individual's decision-making response (i.e., acceptance or rejection). We proposed an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based computational intelligence framework to predict individual responses. Specifically, the discriminative spatial network pattern (DSNP), a supervised learning approach, was applied to single-trial EEG data to extract the DSNP feature from the single-trial brain network. A linear discriminate analysis (LDA) trained on the DSNP features was then used to predict the individual response trial-by-trial. To verify the performance of the proposed DSNP, we recruited two independent subject groups, and recorded the EEGs using two types of EEG systems. The performances of the trial-by-trial predictors achieved an accuracy of 0.88 ± 0.09 for the first dataset, and 0.90 ± 0.10 for the second dataset. These trial-by-trial prediction performances suggested that individual responses could be predicted trial-by-trial by using the specific pattern of single-trial EEG networks, and our proposed method has the potential to establish the biologically inspired artificial intelligence decision system.

10.2196/13111  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Physical rehabilitation is recommended after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). With the expected increase in TKA over the next few decades, it is important to find new ways of delivering cost-effective interventions. Technological interventions have been developed with this intent, but only preliminary evidence exists regarding their validity, with short follow-up times. 
  Objective:  This study aimed to present the follow-up results of a feasibility study comparing two different home-based programs after TKA: conventional face-to-face sessions and a digital intervention performed through the use of an artificial intelligence-powered biofeedback system under remote clinical monitoring. 
  Methods:  The digital intervention uses a motion tracker allowing 3D movement quantification, a mobile app and a Web portal. This study presents the results of the previous single-center, prospective, parallel-group, feasibility study including an 8-week active treatment stage and further assessments at 3 and 6 months post-TKA. Primary outcome was the Timed Up and Go score, and secondary outcomes were the Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Scale (KOOS) score and knee range of motion. 
  Results:  A total of 59 patients completed the study (30 in the digital intervention group and 29 in the conventional rehabilitation group) and follow-up assessments. During the active treatment stage, patients in the digital intervention group demonstrated high engagement and satisfaction levels, with an 82% retention rate. Both groups attained clinically relevant improvements from baseline to 6 months post-TKA. At the end of the 8-week program, clinical outcomes were superior in the digital intervention group. At the 3- and 6-month assessments, the outcomes remained superior for the Timed Up and Go score (P&lt;.001) and all KOOS subscale scores (at 3 months, P&lt;.001 overall; at 6 months, KOOS Symptoms: P=.006, Pain: P=.002, Activities of Daily Living: P=.001, Sports: P=.003, and Quality of Life: P=.001). There was progressive convergence between both groups in terms of the knee range of motion, which remained higher for standing flexion in the digital intervention group than the conventional group at 6 months (P=.01). For the primary outcome, at 6 months, the median difference between groups was 4.87 seconds (95% CI 1.85-7.47), in favor of the digital intervention group. 
  Conclusions:  The present study demonstrates that this novel digital intervention for independent home-based rehabilitation after TKA is feasible, engaging, and capable of maximizing clinical outcomes in comparison to conventional rehabilitation in the short and medium term; in addition, this intervention is far less demanding in terms of human resources.

10.1371/journal.pone.0208308  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Optimization of an artificial neural network model through the use of optimization algorithms is the common method employed to search for an optimum solution for a broad variety of real-world problems. One such optimization algorithm is the kidney-inspired algorithm (KA) which has recently been proposed in the literature. The algorithm mimics the four processes performed by the kidneys: filtration, reabsorption, secretion, and excretion. However, a human with reduced kidney function needs to undergo additional treatment to improve kidney performance. In the medical field, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) test is used to check the health of kidneys. The test estimates the amount of blood that passes through the glomeruli each minute. In this paper, we mimic this kidney function test and the GFR result is used to select a suitable step to add to the basic KA process. This novel imitation is designed for both minimization and maximization problems. In the proposed method, depends on GFR test result which is less than 15 or falls between 15 and 60 or is more than 60 a particular action is performed. These additional processes are applied as required with the aim of improving exploration of the search space and increasing the likelihood of the KA finding the optimum solution. The proposed method is tested on test functions and its results are compared with those of the basic KA. Its performance on benchmark classification and time series prediction problems is also examined and compared with that of other available methods in the literature. In addition, the proposed method is applied to a real-world water quality prediction problem. The statistical analysis of all these applications showed that the proposed method had a ability to improve the optimization outcome.

It is comprised of a set of programmable information processing mechanisms that can be used to predict and explain human behavior including cognition and interaction with the environment. We start by reviewing its history, which shapes its current form, contrasts and relates it to other architectures, and helps readers to anticipate where it is going. Based on this history, we then describe it as a theory of cognition that is realized as a computer program. After this, we briefly discuss tools for working with ACT-R, and also note several major accomplishments that have been gained by working with ACT-R in both basic and applied science, including summarizing some of the insights about human behavior. We conclude by discussing its future, which we believe will include adding emotions and physiology, increasing usability, and the use of nongenerative models.

PMID:30778510  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Words denoting abstract concepts constitute nearly half of human lexicon and serve as building blocks of the human culture. Since the advent of non-invasive neuroimaging techniques, great progress has been made in revealing the neurobiological foundation of concrete object and action concepts, yet it remains unclear how abstract concepts are stored and processed in the brain. Here we review recent development in this field, focusing on both theoretical perspectives and neuroimaging findings. We found that abstract concepts can be represented via linguistic and experiential information; the neural correlates of abstract concepts are partly in line with such a theoretical framework. Future studies are warranted to uncover the cognitive and neural mechanisms of language and experience in abstract word representation, which will help to deepen our understanding of general computational principles of the human conceptual system and to promote the development of the brain-like artificial intelligence.

However, it is difficult to identify them using common health tests. This worksite-based cohort study for 7 years in Japan (n = 7465) was conducted to evaluate the progression of CKD. The outcome was aggravation of the KDIGO prognostic category of CKD 7 years later. The subjects were male, 59.1%; age, 50.1 ± 6.3 years; and eGFR, 79 ± 14.4 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. The number of subjects showing CKD progression started to increase from 3 years later. Vector analysis showed that CKD stage G1 A1 was more progressive than CKD stage G2 A1. Bayesian networks showed that the time-series changes in the prognostic category of CKD were related to the outcome. Support vector machines including time-series data of the prognostic category of CKD from 3 years later detected the high possibility of the outcome not only in subjects at very high risks but also in those at low risks at baseline. In conclusion, after the evaluation of kidney function at a health checkup, it is necessary to follow up not only patients at high risks but also patients at low risks at baseline for 3 years and longer.

Here, the RNA sequencing data related to vascular invasion in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, including 292 HCC patients with complete clinical data were included in our study as the training dataset for construction and E-TABM-36, including 41 HCC patients with complete clinical data was used as the validation dataset. Following data normalization, differentially expressed mRNA and copy number (CN) were selected between with and without vascular invasion samples. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was constructed and validated in GSE9828 and GSE20017 datasets. Total 59 feature genes were found by the SVM classifier. Using Cox regression analysis, three clinical features, including Patholigic T, Stage and vascular invasion and 6 optimal prognostic genes, including ANO1, EPHX2, GFRA1, OLFM2, SERPINA10 and TKT were significantly correlated with prognosis. A risk score formula was developed to assess the prognostic value of 6 optimal prognostic genes, which were identified to possess the most remarkable correlation with overall survival in HCC patients. By performing in vitro experiments, we observed TKT was significantly increased, but OLFM2 was decreased in high metastatic potential HCC cell lines (SK-HEP-1 and MHCC-97 H) compared with low metastatic potential cell line Huh7 and normal human liver cell line LO2 using western blotting analysis. Knockdown of TKT in MHCC-97H or overexpression of OLFM2 in SK-HEP-1 significantly suppressed cell migration and invasion using transwell assays. Our results demonstrated that TKT and OLFM2 might be novel independent biomarkers for predicting survival based on the presence of vascular invasion in patients with HCC.

10.3390/ijms20184462  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Apple skin russeting naturally occurs in many varieties, particularly in "Golden Delicious" and its pedigree, and is regarded as a non-invasive physiological disorder partly caused by excessive deposition of lignin. However, the understanding of its molecular mechanism is still limited. In this study, we used iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation) and RNA-seq to detect the changes in the expression levels of genes and proteins in three developmental stages of russeting formation, in russeted (non-bagging) and non-russeted (bagging) skin of "Golden Delicious" apple. 2856 differentially expressed genes and 942 differentially expressed proteins in the comparison groups were detected at the transcript level and protein level, respectively. A correlation analysis of the transcriptomics and proteomics data revealed that four genes (MD03G1059200, MD08G1009200, MD17G1092400, and MD17G1225100) involved in lignin biosynthesis are significant changed during apple russeting formation. Additionally, 92 transcription factors, including 4 LIM transcription factors, may be involved in apple russeting formation. Among them, one LIM transcription factor (MD15G1068200) was capable of binding to the PAL-box like (CCACTTGAGTAC) element, which indicated it was potentially involved in lignin biosynthesis. This study will provide further views on the molecular mechanisms controlling apple russeting formation.

10.1371/journal.pone.0218946  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) formation is part of the neutrophil response to infections, but excessive or inappropriate NETosis may trigger the production of autoantibodies and cause organ damage in autoimmune disorders. Spontaneously netting neutrophils are not frequent and induction of NET in vitro by selected stimuli is necessary to investigate their structure. In the present work, the protein composition and post-translational modifications of NET produced under different stimuli have been studied by means of proteomic analysis. Neutrophils from healthy donors were stimulated by PMA, A23187, Escherichia coli LPS or untreated; after three hours, cells were washed, treated with DNase and supernatants collected for mass spectrometry. Data were analyzed by unsupervised hierarchical clustering analyses. We identified proteins contained in NETs of any source or exclusive of one stimulus: LPS-induced and spontaneous NET diverge in protein composition, while PMA- and A23187-induced NET appear more similar. Among the post-translational modifications we examined, methionine sulfoxidation is frequent especially in PMA- and LPS-induced NETs. Myeloperoxidase is the protein more extensively modified. Thus, proteomic analysis indicates that NETs induced by different stimuli are heterogeneous in terms of both protein composition and post-translational modifications, suggesting that NET induced in different conditions may have different biological effects.

10.1007/s00018-018-2970-1  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Thoracic aorta perivascular adipose tissue (T-PVAT) has critical roles in regulating vascular homeostasis. However, the developmental characteristics and cellular lineage of adipocyte in the T-PVAT remain unclear. We show that T-PVAT contains three long strip-shaped fat depots, anterior T-PVAT (A-T-PVAT), left lateral T-PVAT (LL-T-PVAT), and right lateral T-PVAT (RL-T-PVAT). A-T-PVAT displays a distinct transcriptional profile and developmental origin compared to the two lateral T-PVATs (L-T-PVAT). Lineage tracing studies indicate that A-T-PVAT adipocytes are primarily derived from SM22α<sup>+</sup> progenitors, whereas L-T-PVAT contains both SM22α<sup>+</sup> and Myf5<sup>+</sup> cells. We also show that L-T-PVAT contains more UCP1<sup>+</sup> brown adipocytes than A-T-PVAT, and L-T-PVAT exerts a greater relaxing effect on aorta than A-T-PVAT. Angiotensin II-infused hypertensive mice display greater macrophage infiltration into A-T-PVAT than L-T-PVAT. These combined results indicate that L-T-PVAT has a distinct development from A-T-PVAT with different cellular lineage, and suggest that L-T-PVAT and A-T-PVAT have different physiological and pathological functions.

10.1016/j.gene.2019.144150  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Ovarian cancer (OC) is the deadliest form of gynecologic malignancy, with the majority of patients being diagnosed only once the disease reaches an advanced stage owing to a lack of available biomarkers capable of accurately detecting the disease. Stable circular RNAs (circRNAs) can be found at high levels in exosomes, and there is evidence to suggest that they may be viable diagnostic biomarkers for certain cancers. However, circRNAs in the serum of OC patients have rarely been evaluated to date. We therefore sought to investigate serum circRNA profiles of OC patients, and to explore whether these sorts of circRNAs could be used to detect early OC, serving as biomarkers of disease that may allow for the earlier treatment thereof. Second-generation sequencing was used to screen differentially expressed circRNAs in OC patient serum and also in the serum obtained from healthy controls, and circRNA expression was confirmed by qPCR. A bioinformatics-based approach was then used to assess what biological functions might be affected be the altered regulation of these RNA molecules. We further conducted GO, KEGG, and network analyses to further explore the expression of circRNAs. We detected 178 differentially expressed circRNAs in OC patient serum, of which 175 were up-regulated and 3 were down-regulated. We validated 5 of these identified circRNAs by qPCR to confirm their expression, and further found these RNAs to be closely linked with FC gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, VEGF signaling, Transcriptional misregulation in cancer, Chemokine signaling, ErbB signaling, and TNF signaling based on conducted analyses. This study provides a profile of circRNAs in OC patient serum, revealing a pattern of dysregulation of these RNAs associated with OC. Our bioinformatics analysis suggested that these circRNAs are likely related to OC development, and as such they may be viable novel OC biomarkers.

10.1007/s11033-018-4533-9  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   E2 (ubiquitin conjugating enzymes) is an important part of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. These enzymes have a significant role to play during plant growth and development, which can response to various stresses. To date, the E2 family has been reported in some high plants, but the genome-wide characterization of this gene family in potato remains unknown. In the present study, 57 putative StUBCs were identified, which were clustered into eight subgroups based on phylogeny. The introns varied in numbers 0 to 9. The highest numbers of introns were 5, which accounted for 31.57%. The analysis of gene duplication showed that 22 StUBC genes were involved in 13 segmental duplication events, while no tandem duplication was found in StUBC genes. According to gene ontology analysis (GO), StUBC family major function is protein binding and ion binding. The RNA sequencing data revealed that 15 StUBC genes were highly expressed in different organs and tubers. 27 StUBC genes were up-regulated under 50 µM ABA treatments. Moreover, the RNA-seq data and qRT-PCR analysis indicated that 17 StUBC genes responded to heat stress. 8 StUBC genes responded to salt stress according to qRT-PCR analysis, and StUBC2, StUBC12, StUBC30 and StUBC13 were predominant expression. The result of this research could provide valuable information to insight into potato E2 family and establish a foundation for further to elucidate function of E2 genes.

10.1162/artl_a_00288  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   We propose an approach to open-ended evolution via the simulation of swarm dynamics. In nature, swarms possess remarkable properties, which allow many organisms, from swarming bacteria to ants and flocking birds, to form higher-order structures that enhance their behavior as a group. Swarm simulations highlight three important factors to create novelty and diversity: (a) communication generates combinatorial cooperative dynamics, (b) concurrency allows for separation of time scales, and (c) complexity and size increases push the system towards transitions in innovation. We illustrate these three components in a model computing the continuous evolution of a swarm of agents. The results, divided into three distinct applications, show how emergent structures are capable of filtering information through the bottleneck of their memory, to produce meaningful novelty and diversity within their simulated environment.

10.3390/ijms20246108  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Petal senescence involves numerous programmed changes in biological and biochemical processes. Ubiquitination plays a critical role in protein degradation, a hallmark of organ senescence. Therefore, we investigated changes in the proteome and ubiquitome of senescing rose (<i>Rosa hybrida</i>) petals to better understand their involvement in petal senescence. Of 3859 proteins quantified in senescing petals, 1198 were upregulated, and 726 were downregulated during senescence. We identified 2208 ubiquitinated sites, including 384 with increased ubiquitination in 298 proteins and 1035 with decreased ubiquitination in 674 proteins. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses revealed that proteins related to peptidases in proteolysis and autophagy pathways were enriched in the proteome, suggesting that protein degradation and autophagy play important roles in petal senescence. In addition, many transporter proteins accumulated in senescing petals, and several transport processes were enriched in the ubiquitome, indicating that transport of substances is associated with petal senescence and regulated by ubiquitination. Moreover, several components of the brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis and signaling pathways were significantly altered at the protein and ubiquitination levels, implying that BR plays an important role in petal senescence. Our data provide a comprehensive view of rose petal senescence at the posttranslational level.

10.3390/ijms20020296  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The advancement of bioinformatics and machine learning has facilitated the discovery and validation of omics-based biomarkers. This study employed a novel approach combining multi-platform transcriptomics and cutting-edge algorithms to introduce novel signatures for accurate diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Different random forests (RF)-based feature selection methods including the area under the curve (AUC)-RF, Boruta, and Vita were used and the diagnostic performance of the proposed biosignatures was benchmarked using RF, logistic regression, naïve Bayes, and k-nearest neighbors models. All models showed satisfactory performance in which RF appeared to be the best. For instance, regarding the RF model, the following were observed: mean accuracy 0.998 (standard deviation (SD) &lt; 0.003), mean specificity 0.999 (SD &lt; 0.003), and mean sensitivity 0.998 (SD &lt; 0.004). Moreover, proposed biomarker signatures were highly associated with multifaceted hallmarks in cancer. Some biomarkers were found to be enriched in epithelial cell signaling in <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection and inflammatory processes. The overexpression of <i>TGFBI</i> and <i>S100A2</i> was associated with poor disease-free survival while the down-regulation of <i>NR5A2</i>, <i>SLC4A4</i>, and <i>CD177</i> was linked to worse overall survival of the patients. In conclusion, novel transcriptome signatures to improve the diagnostic accuracy in CRC are introduced for further validations in various clinical settings.

10.1371/journal.pone.0215901  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter genes act as transporters for different molecules across biological membranes and are involved in a diverse range of biological processes. In this study, we performed a genome-wide identification and expression analysis of genes encoding ABC transporter proteins in three Capsicum species, i.e., Capsicum annuum, Capsicum baccatum and Capsicum chinense. Capsicum is a valuable horticultural crop worldwide as an important constituent of many foods while containing several medicinal compounds including capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin. Our results identified the presence of a total of 200, 185 and 187 ABC transporter genes in C. annuum, C. baccatum and C. chinense genomes, respectively. Capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin content were determined in green pepper fruits (16 dpa). Additionally, we conducted different bioinformatics analyses including ABC genes classification, gene chromosomal location, Cis elements, conserved motifs identification and gene ontology classification, as well as profile expression of selected genes. Based on phylogenetic analysis and domain organization, the Capsicum ABC gene family was grouped into eight subfamilies. Among them, members within the ABCG, ABCB and ABCC subfamilies were the most abundant, while ABCD and ABCE subfamilies were less abundant throughout all species. ABC members within the same subfamily showed similar motif composition. Furthermore, common cis-elements involved in the transcriptional regulation were also identified in the promoter regions of all Capsicum ABC genes. Gene expression data from RNAseq and reverse transcription-semi-quantitative PCR analysis revealed development-specific stage expression profiles in placenta tissues. It suggests that ABC transporters, specifically the ABCC and ABCG subfamilies, may be playing important roles in the transport of secondary metabolites such as capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin to the placenta vacuoles, effecting on their content in pepper fruits. Our results provide a more comprehensive understanding of ABC transporter gene family in different Capsicum species while allowing the identification of important candidate genes related to capsaicin content for subsequent functional validation.

10.1055/s-0038-1668122  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Although several studies highlight the advantages of robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA), few investigate its intraoperative outcome. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the RA-TKA's ability to assist with intraoperative correction of: (1) flexion and (2) extension gaps, as well as its ability to (3) accurately predict implant sizes. Additionally, in this RA-TKA cohort, length of stay, complications, and readmissions were assessed. A total of 335 patients who underwent RA-TKA were included. The robotic software virtually measured the intraoperative prebone cut extension and flexion gaps. Differences in medial versus lateral prebone cut extension and flexion gaps were calculated. A total of 155 patients (46%) had an extension gap difference of between -2 and 2 mm (mean, -0.3 mm), while 119 patients (36%) had a flexion gap difference of between -2 and 2 mm (mean, -0.6 mm). Postbone cut differences in medial versus lateral flexion and extension gaps were measured. Balanced knees were considered to have a medial and lateral flexion gap difference within 2 mm. The robot-predicted implant size was also compared with the final implant size. Additionally, lengths of stay, complications, and readmissions were assessed. All patients achieved a postbone cut extension gap difference between -1 and 1 mm (mean, -0.1 mm). A total of 332 patients (99%) achieved a postbone cut flexion gap difference of between -2 and 2 mm (mean, 0 mm). For 98% of prostheses, the robotic software predicted within 1 implant size the actual tibial or femoral implant size used.The mean length of stay was found to be 2 days. No patients suffered from superficial skin infection, pin site infections or fractures, soft tissue damage, and no robotic cases were converted to manual TKA due to intraoperative complications. A total of 8 patients (2.2%) were readmitted; however, none were directly related to robotic use. The robotic software and use of a preoperative computed tomography (CT) substantially helped with intraoperative planning and accurate prediction of implant sizes. Therefore, based on the results of this study, the RA-TKA device does, in fact, provide considerable intraoperative assistance.

10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.07.011  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Purpose:  A noninvasive diagnostic method to predict the degree of malignancy accurately would be of great help in glioma management. This study aimed to create a highly accurate machine learning model to perform glioma grading. 
  Methods and materials:  Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging acquired for cases of glioma operated on at our institution from October 2014 through January 2018 were obtained retrospectively. Six types of magnetic resonance imaging sequences (T<sub>2</sub>-weighted image, diffusion-weighted image, apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC], fractional anisotropy, and mean kurtosis [MK]) were chosen for analysis; 476 features were extracted semiautomatically for each sequence (2856 features in total). Recursive feature elimination was used to select significant features for a machine learning model that distinguishes glioblastoma from lower-grade glioma (grades 2 and 3). 
  Results:  Fifty-five data sets from 54 cases were obtained (14 grade 2 gliomas, 12 grade 3 gliomas, and 29 glioblastomas), of which 44 and 11 data sets were used for machine learning and independent testing, respectively. We detected 504 features with significant differences (false discovery rate &lt;0.05) between glioblastoma and lower-grade glioma. The most accurate machine learning model was created using 6 features extracted from the ADC and MK images. In the logistic regression, the area under the curve was 0.90 ± 0.05, and the accuracy of the test data set was 0.91 (10 out of 11); using a support vector machine, they were 0.93 ± 0.03 and 0.91 (10 out of 11), respectively (kernel, radial basis function; c = 1.0). 
  Conclusions:  Our machine learning model accurately predicted glioma tumor grade. The ADC and MK sequences produced particularly useful features.

10.1186/s12864-018-5400-8  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Sugarcane smut is a fungal disease caused by Sporisorium scitamineum. Cultivation of smut-resistant sugarcane varieties is the most effective way to control this disease. The interaction between sugarcane and S. scitamineum is a complex network system. However, to date, there is no report on the identification of microRNA (miRNA) target genes of sugarcane in response to smut pathogen infection by degradome technology. 
  Results:  TaqMan qRT-PCR detection and enzyme activity determination showed that S. scitamineum rapidly proliferated and incurred significant enzyme activity changes in the reactive oxygen species metabolic pathway and phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway at 2 d and 5 d after inoculation, which was the best time points to study target gene degradation during sugarcane and S. scitamineum interaction. A total of 122.33 Mb of raw data was obtained from degradome sequencing analysis of YC05-179 (smut-resistant) and ROC22 (smut-susceptible) after inoculation. The Q30 of each sample was &gt; 93%, and the sequence used for degradation site analysis exactly matched the sugarcane reference sequence. A total of 309 target genes were predicted in sugarcane, corresponding to 97 known miRNAs and 112 novel miRNAs, and 337 degradation sites, suggesting that miRNAs can efficiently direct cleavage at multiple sites in the predicted target mRNAs. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis indicated that the predicted target genes were involved in various regulatory processes, such as signal transduction mechanisms, inorganic ion transport and metabolism, defense mechanisms, translation, posttranslational modifications, energy production and conversion, and glycerolipid metabolism. qRT-PCR analysis of the expression level of 13 predicted target genes and their corresponding miRNAs revealed that there was no obvious negative regulatory relationship between miRNAs and their target genes. In addition, a number of putative resistance-related target genes regulated by miRNA-mediated cleavage were accumulated in sugarcane during S. scitamineum infection, suggesting that feedback regulation of miRNAs may be involved in the response of sugarcane to S. scitamineum infection. 
  Conclusions:  This study elucidates the underlying response of sugarcane to S. scitamineum infection, and also provides a resource for miRNAs and their predicted target genes for smut resistance improvement in sugarcane.

10.1007/s10142-018-0629-5  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Oligopeptide transporters (OPT) are integral cell membrane proteins that play a critical role in the transport of small peptides, secondary amino acids, glutathione conjugates, and mineral uptake. In the present study, 67 putative wheat yellow stripe-like transporter (YSL) proteins belonging to the subfamily of OPT transporters were identified. Phylogeny analysis resulted in the distribution of wheat YSLs into four discrete clades. The highest number of YSLs was present on the A genome and the chromosome 2 of hexaploid wheat. The identified wheat YSL genes showed differential expression in different tissues and during grain development suggesting the importance of this subfamily. Gene expression pattern of TaYSLs during iron starvation experiments suggested an early high transcript accumulation of TaYS1A, TaYS1B, TaYSL3, TaYSL5, and TaYSL6 in roots. In contrast, delayed expression was observed in shoots for TaYS1A, TaYS1B, TaYSL5, TaYSL12, and TaYSL19 as compared to control. Further, their expression under biotic and abiotic response emphasized their alternative functions during the plant growth and development. In conclusion, this work is the first comprehensive study of wheat YSL transporters and would be an important resource for prioritizing genes towards wheat biofortification.

10.1007/s10142-018-0635-7  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> along with drought is a serious global threat to crop productivity. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms plants use to protect these stresses is the key for plant growth and development. In this study, we mimicked natural stress conditions under a controlled Soil-Plant-Atmosphere-Research (SPAR) system and provided the evidence for how miRNAs regulate target genes under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and drought conditions. Significant physiological and biomass data supported the effective utilization of source-sink (leaf to root) under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Additionally, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> partially rescued the effect of drought on total biomass. We identified both known and novel miRNAs differentially expressed during drought, CO<sub>2</sub>, and combined stress, along with putative targets. A total of 32 conserved miRNAs belonged to 23 miRNA families, and 25 novel miRNAs were identified by deep sequencing. Using the existing sweet potato genome database and stringent analyses, a total of 42 and 22 potential target genes were predicted for the conserved and novel miRNAs, respectively. These target genes are involved in drought response, hormone signaling, photosynthesis, carbon fixation, sucrose and starch metabolism, etc. Gene ontology and KEGG ontology functional enrichment revealed that these miRNAs might target transcription factors (MYB, TCP, NAC), hormone signaling regulators (ARF, AP2/ERF), cold and drought factors (corA), carbon metabolism (ATP synthase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate), and photosynthesis (photosystem I and II complex units). Our study is the first report identifying targets of miRNAs under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels and could support the molecular mechanisms under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> in sweet potato and other crops in the future.

10.3892/mmr.2018.9641  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Numerous studies have revealed that microRNAs (miRNAs) are functional non‑coding RNAs that serve roles in a variety of biological processes. However, the expression patterns and regulatory networks, as well as the miRNAs involved in liver fibrosis remain to be elucidated. In the present study, a mouse model of liver fibrosis was constructed by CCl4 intraperitoneal injection and the total RNAs were extracted from the liver of the mice. The total RNAs were then sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform and an integrated analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in CCl4‑induced liver fibrosis was performed. Compared with normal liver samples, 56 and 15 miRNAs were found to be upregulated and downregulated in fibrotic livers, respectively. To predict the potential functions of these miRNAs, bioinformatics analysis, including Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, was used to assess target mRNAs. The results indicated that the mitogen‑activated protein kinase, phosphoinositide 3 kinase/protein kinase B and focal adhesion signaling pathways were the most significantly enriched. In addition, a regulatory network containing five dysregulated miRNAs and 22 target mRNAs was constructed based on their inverse correlation. Furthermore, the five dysregulated miRNAs were significantly upregulated and the expression of RELB, RAP1A, PPP3CB, MAP2K4, ARRB1, MAP3K4, FGF1 and PRKCB in the network was significantly decreased in LX‑2 cells following TGF‑β1 treatment which suggested that they were associated with the activation of human hepatic stellate cells. The miRNA‑mRNA regulatory network produced in the present study may provide novel insights into the role of miRNAs in liver fibrosis.

10.1016/j.ymeth.2018.11.015  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The regulation of gene expression occurs through complex relationships between transcription, processing, turnover, and translation, which are only beginning to be elucidated. We know that at least for certain messenger (m) RNAs, processing, modifications, and sequence elements can greatly influence their translational output through recognition by translation and turn-over machinery. Recently, we and others have combined high-throughput sequencing technologies with traditional biochemical methods of studying translation to extend our understanding of these relationships. Additionally, there is growing importance given to how these processes may be regulated across varied cell types as a means to achieve tissue-specific expression of proteins. Here, we provide an in-depth methodology for polysome profiling to dissect the composition of mRNAs and proteins that make up the translatome from both whole tissues and a specific cell type isolated from mammalian tissue. Also, we provide a detailed computational workflow for the analysis of the next-generation sequencing data generated from these experiments.

Human dental follicle cells (hDFCs) are the precursor cells of periodontal development. Long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been revealed to be crucial factors that regulate a variety of biological processes; however, whether lncRNAs serve a role in human periodontal development remains unknown. Therefore, the present study used microarrays to detect the differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs between hDFCs and human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs). A total of 845 lncRNAs and 1,012 mRNAs were identified to be differentially expressed in hDFCs and hPDLCs (fold change &gt;2.0 or &lt;‑2.0; P&lt;0.05). Microarray data were validated by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Bioinformatics analyses, including gene ontology, pathway analysis and coding‑non‑coding gene co‑expression network analysis, were performed to determine the functions of the differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs. Bioinformatics analysis identified that a number of pathways may be associated with periodontal development, including the p53 and calcium signaling pathways. This analysis also revealed a number of lncRNAs, including NR_033932, T152410, ENST00000512129, ENST00000540293, uc021sxs.1 and ENST00000609146, which may serve important roles in the biological process of hDFCs. In addition, the lncRNA termed maternally expressed 3 (MEG3) was identified to be differentially expressed in hDFCs by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The knockdown of MEG3 was associated with a reduction of pluripotency makers in hDFCs. In conclusion, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, the current study determined the different expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs between hDFCs and hPDLCs. The observations made may provide a solid foundation for further research into the molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs in human periodontal development.

10.1016/j.jcmgh.2018.09.008  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background &amp; aims:  Our goal was to develop an initial study for the proof of concept whereby gastric cancer organoids are used as an approach to predict the tumor response in individual patients. 
  Methods:  Organoids were derived from resected gastric cancer tumors (huTGOs) or normal stomach tissue collected from sleeve gastrectomies (huFGOs). Organoid cultures were treated with standard-of-care chemotherapeutic drugs corresponding to patient treatment: epirubicin, oxaliplatin, and 5-fluorouracil. Organoid response to chemotherapeutic treatment was correlated with the tumor response in each patient from whom the huTGOs were derived. HuTGOs were orthotopically transplanted into the gastric mucosa of NOD scid gamma mice. 
  Results:  Whereas huFGOs exhibited a half maximal inhibitory concentration that was similar among organoid lines, divergent responses and varying half maximal inhibitory concentration values among the huTGO lines were observed in response to chemotherapeutic drugs. HuTGOs that were sensitive to treatment were derived from a patient with a near complete tumor response to chemotherapy. However, organoids resistant to treatment were derived from patients who exhibited no response to chemotherapy. Orthotropic transplantation of organoids resulted in the engraftment and development of human adenocarcinoma. RNA sequencing revealed that huTGOs closely resembled the patient's native tumor tissue and not commonly used gastric cancer cell lines and cell lines derived from the organoid cultures. 
  Conclusions:  The treatment of patient-derived organoids alongside patients from whom cultures were derived will ultimately test their usefulness to predict individual therapy response and patient outcome.

10.1038/s41440-018-0177-3  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Pre-emptive medicine is a novel medical concept proposed in Japan that aims to precisely predict the onset and progression of diseases and to provide therapeutic interventions during early stages, before symptoms appear. The concept of pre-emptive medicine considers the time-course of a disease in each individual and seeks medical interventions to prevent disease progression. Suitable and promising targets for pre-emptive medicine are non-communicable diseases, including hypertension. Recent advances in genomic analysis, information technology, and artificial intelligence should make this medical concept feasible in the near future. In this review, we focused on pre-emptive medicine for hypertension, referring to concrete plans for the future direction of this research. The ultimate goal of pre-emptive medicine is to completely prevent the onset and progression of hypertension by precisely predicting the elevation of blood pressure and performing interventions to avoid it. The diagnostic processes of hypertension, from the standpoint of pre-emptive medicine, should include the detection of abnormal blood pressure regulation as the earliest manifestation of the disease, the depiction of the present status of hypertension in an individual ("nowcasting"), and a prediction of the future trajectory of the disease ("forecasting"). Novel therapeutic strategies for hypertension, from the standpoint of pre-emptive medicine, should aim for the regression of hypertension through early treatments and the remission of hypertension through intermittent intensive therapies. An efficient modification of lifestyle and therapies, according to the progression of hypertension, should be required. If pre-emptive medicine for hypertension becomes established, it would greatly contribute to the extension of a healthy lifespan, which cannot yet be satisfactorily achieved.

10.1055/a-0740-8631  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The increase in life expectancy and Healthy Life Years in Europe is largely attributable to the success of cardiovascular medicine. Technical developments enable ever more detailed insights into disease processes and enable a precise, multimodal diagnosis of even complex diseases using digital imaging, cardiac biomarkers and genomic information. The rapid availability of this data, often in real time, allows optimized planning and performing of tailored interventional, surgical, or pharmacotherapies. But there are also completely new challenges due to the growing flood of data, the integration of which can no longer be achieved by the individual doctor. The active involvement and participation of the patient also requires new digital concepts and should include decision-making, treatment planning, (long-term) history, and feedback on success and adverse drug reactions. By using artificial intelligence, digital communication and decision support systems, economic benefits, quality improvements and acceleration of outpatient and inpatient treatment become possible.The DGK supports these developments in its own activities, both in project planning, communication with specialist groups, and in training and education. In this article you will find excerpts from current developments of digital cardiology.

10.1007/s00259-019-04437-x  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Purpose:  To improve the test-retest reproducibility of coronary plaque <sup>18</sup>F-sodium fluoride (<sup>18</sup>F-NaF) positron emission tomography (PET) uptake measurements. 
  Methods:  We recruited 20 patients with coronary artery disease who underwent repeated hybrid PET/CT angiography (CTA) imaging within 3 weeks. All patients had 30-min PET acquisition and CTA during a single imaging session. Five PET image-sets with progressive motion correction were reconstructed: (i) a static dataset (no-MC), (ii) end-diastolic PET (standard), (iii) cardiac motion corrected (MC), (iv) combined cardiac and gross patient motion corrected (2 × MC) and, (v) cardiorespiratory and gross patient motion corrected (3 × MC). In addition to motion correction, all datasets were corrected for variations in the background activities which are introduced by variations in the injection-to-scan delays (background blood pool clearance correction, BC). Test-retest reproducibility of PET target-to-background ratio (TBR) was assessed by Bland-Altman analysis and coefficient of reproducibility. 
  Results:  A total of 47 unique coronary lesions were identified on CTA. Motion correction in combination with BC improved the PET TBR test-retest reproducibility for all lesions (coefficient of reproducibility: standard = 0.437, no-MC = 0.345 (27% improvement), standard + BC = 0.365 (20% improvement), no-MC + BC = 0.341 (27% improvement), MC + BC = 0.288 (52% improvement), 2 × MC + BC = 0.278 (57% improvement) and 3 × C + BC = 0.254 (72% improvement), all p &lt; 0.001). Importantly, in a sub-analysis of <sup>18</sup>F-NaF-avid lesions with gross patient motion &gt; 10 mm following corrections, reproducibility was improved by 133% (coefficient of reproducibility: standard = 0.745, 3 × MC = 0.320). 
  Conclusion:  Joint corrections for cardiac, respiratory, and gross patient motion in combination with background blood pool corrections markedly improve test-retest reproducibility of coronary <sup>18</sup>F-NaF PET.

In order to obtain detailed information about the pathogenesis and host immune response in a PEDV-infected host for first In vivo study we used high-throughput sequencing to analyze the gene expression differences of the small intestinal mucosa after infection with PEDV. Transcripts obtained were over 65,525,000 clean reads after reassembly were 22,605 genes detected, of which 22,248 were known genes and 371 new genes were predicted. Moreover, 3168 genes expression was up-regulated and 3876 genes down-regulated. (Gene Ontology) GO annotation and functional enrichment analysis indicated that all of the DEGs (differentially expressed genes) were annotated into biological process, cellular component and molecular function. Most of these unigenes are annotated in cellular processes, the cell and binding. KEGG analysis of the DEGs showed that a total of 7044 DEGs unigenes were annotated into 323 pathways classified into 6 main categories. Most of these unigenes are annotated were related to immune system response to the infectious diseases pathways. In addition, 20 DEGs were verified by quantitative real-time PCR. As the first, in vivo, RNAseq analysis of piglets and PEDV infection, our study provides knowledge about the transcriptomics of intestinal mucosa in PEDV-infected piglets, from which a complex molecular pathways and pathogenesis-related biological processes are involved in PEDV interaction with piglet intestinal mucosa.

10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134230  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   A quantitative understanding of the hydro-environmental factors that influence the occurrence of agricultural drought events would enable more strategic climate change adaptation and drought management plans. Practical drought hazard mapping remains challenging due to possible exclusion of the most pertinent drought drivers, and to the use of inadequate predictive models that cannot describe drought adequately. This research aims to develop new approaches to map agricultural drought hazard with state-of-the-art machine learning models, including classification and regression trees (CART), boosted regression trees (BRT), random forests (RF), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), flexible discriminant analysis (FDA) and support vector machines (SVM). Hydro-environmental datasets were used to calculate the relative departure of soil moisture (RDSM) for eight severe droughts for drought-prone southeast Queensland, Australia, over the period 1994-2013. RDSM was then used to generate an agricultural drought inventory map. Eight hydro-environmental factors were used as potential predictors of drought. The goodness-of-fit and predictive performance of all models were evaluated using different threshold-dependent and threshold-independent methods, including the true skill statistic (TSS), Efficiency (E), F-score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). The RF model (AUC-ROC = 97.7%, TSS = 0.873, E = 0.929, F-score = 0.898) yielded the highest accuracy, while the FDA model (with AUC-ROC = 73.9%, TSS = 0.424, E = 0.719, F-score = 0.512) showed the worst performance. The plant available water holding capacity (PAWC), mean annual precipitation, and clay content were the most important variables to be used for predicting the agricultural drought. About 21.2% of the area is in high or very high drought risk classes, and therefore, warrant drought and environmental protection policies. Importantly, the models do not require data on the precipitation anomaly for any given drought year; the spatial patterns in AGH were consistent for all drought events, despite very different spatial patterns in precipitation anomaly among events. Such machine-learning approaches are able to construct an overall risk map, thus assisting in the adoption of a robust drought contingency planning measure not only for this area, but also, in other regions where drought presents a pressing challenge, including its influence on key practical dimensions of social, environmental and economic sustainability.

10.12659/MSM.917399  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   BACKGROUND Although the mortality rates of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) have decreased in recent years, the clinical outcome remains highly dependent on the individual patient. Therefore, identifying novel biomarkers for ccRCC patients is crucial. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this study, we obtained RNA sequencing data and clinical information from the TCGA database. Subsequently, we performed integrated bioinformatic analysis that includes differently expressed genes analysis, gene ontology and KEGG pathway analysis, protein-protein interaction analysis, and survival analysis. Moreover, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were constructed. RESULTS As a result, we identified a total of 263 dysregulated genes that may participate in the metastasis of ccRCC, and established a predictive signature relying on the expression of OTX1, MATN4, PI3, ERVV-2, and NFE4, which could serve as significant progressive and prognostic biomarkers for ccRCC. CONCLUSIONS We identified differentially expressed genes that may be involved in the metastasis of ccRCC. Moreover, a predictive signature based on the expression of OTX1, MATN4, PI3, ERVV-2, and NFE4 could be an independent prognostic factor for ccRCC.

10.1016/j.radonc.2019.11.023  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  In the clinical management of advanced gastric cancer (AGC), preoperative identification of early recurrence after curative resection is essential. Thus, we aimed to create a CT-based radiomic model to predict early recurrence in AGC patients preoperatively. 
  Materials and methods:  We enrolled 669 consecutive patients (302 in the training set, 219 in the internal test set and 148 in the external test set) with clinicopathologically confirmed AGC from two centers. Radiomic features were extracted from preoperative diagnostic CT images. Machine learning methods were applied to shrink feature size and build a predictive radiomic signature. We incorporated the radiomic signature and clinical risk factors into a nomogram using multivariable logistic regression analysis. The area under the curve (AUC) of operating characteristics (ROC), accuracy, and calibration curves were assessed to evaluate the nomogram's performance in discriminating early recurrence. 
  Results:  A radiomic signature, including three hand crafted features and six deep learning features, was significantly associated with early recurrence (p-value &lt;0.0001 for all sets). In addition, clinical N stage, carbohydrate antigen 199 levels, carcinoembryonic antigen levels, and Borrmann type were considered useful predictors for early recurrence. The nomogram, combining all these predictors, showed powerful prognostic ability in the training set and two test sets with AUCs of 0.831 (95% CI, 0.786-0.876), 0.826 (0.772-0.880) and 0.806 (0.732-0.881), respectively. The predicted risk yielded good agreement with the observed recurrence probability. 
  Conclusions:  By incorporating a radiomic signature and clinical risk factors, we created a radiomic nomogram to predict early recurrence in patients with AGC, preoperatively, which may serve as a potential tool to guide personalized treatment.

10.3390/s19214788  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   In an Internet of Things (IoT) system, it is essential that the data measured from the sensors are accurate so that the produced results are meaningful. For example, in AgriTalk, a smart farm platform for soil cultivation with a large number of sensors, the produced sensor data are used in several Artificial Intelligence (AI) models to provide precise farming for soil microbiome and fertility, disease regulation, irrigation regulation, and pest regulation. It is important that the sensor data are correctly used in AI modeling. Unfortunately, no sensor is perfect. Even for the sensors manufactured from the same factory, they may yield different readings. This paper proposes a solution called SensorTalk to automatically detect potential sensor failures and calibrate the aging sensors semi-automatically. Numerical examples are given to show the calibration tables for temperature and humidity sensors. When the sensors control the actuators, the SensorTalk solution can also detect whether a failure occurs within a detection delay. Both analytic and simulation models are proposed to appropriately select the detection delay so that, when a potential failure occurs, it is detected reasonably early without incurring too many false alarms. Specifically, our selection can limit the false detection probability to be less than 0.7%.

10.1016/j.ophtha.2019.12.004  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Purpose:  To quantify the central visual field (VF) loss patterns in glaucoma using artificial intelligence. 
  Design:  Retrospective study. 
  Participants:  VFs of 8712 patients with 13 951 Humphrey 10-2 test results from 13 951 eyes for cross-sectional analyses, and 824 patients with at least 5 reliable 10-2 test results at 6-month intervals or more from 1191 eyes for longitudinal analyses. 
  Methods:  Total deviation values were used to determine the central VF patterns using the most recent 10-2 test results. A 24-2 VF within a 3-month window of the 10-2 tests was used to stage eyes into mild, moderate, or severe functional loss using the Hodapp-Anderson-Parrish scale at baseline. Archetypal analysis was applied to determine the central VF patterns. Cross-validation was performed to determine the optimal number of patterns. Stepwise regression was applied to select the optimal feature combination of global indices, average baseline decomposition coefficients from central VFs archetypes, and other factors to predict central VF mean deviation (MD) slope based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). 
  Main outcome measures:  The central VF patterns stratified by severity stage based on 24-2 test results and a model to predict the central VF MD change over time using baseline test results. 
  Results:  From cross-sectional analysis, 17 distinct central VF patterns were determined for the 13 951 eyes across the spectrum of disease severity. These central VF patterns could be divided into isolated superior loss, isolated inferior loss, diffuse loss, and other loss patterns. Notably, 4 of the 5 patterns of diffuse VF loss preserved the less vulnerable inferotemporal zone, whereas they lost most of the remaining more vulnerable zone described by the Hood model. Inclusion of coefficients from central VF archetypical patterns strongly improved the prediction of central VF MD slope (BIC decrease, 35; BIC decrease of &gt;6 indicating strong prediction improvement) than using only the global indices of 2 baseline VF results. Eyes with baseline VF results with more superonasal and inferonasal loss were more likely to show worsening MD over time. 
  Conclusions:  We quantified central VF patterns in glaucoma, which were used to improve the prediction of central VF worsening compared with using only global indices.

10.3390/s19030613  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Thanks to the benefits of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in wireless communications, we evaluate a wireless sensor network deploying NOMA (WSN-NOMA), where the destination can receive two data symbols in a whole transmission process with two time slots. In this work, two relaying protocols, so-called time-switching-based relaying WSN-NOMA (TSR WSN-NOMA) and power-splitting-based relaying WSN-NOMA (PSR WSN-NOMA) are deployed to study energy-harvesting (EH). Regarding the system performance analysis, we obtain the closed-form expressions for the exact and approximate outage probability (OP) in both protocols, and the delay-limited throughput is also evaluated. We then compare the two protocols theoretically, and two optimization problems are formulated to reduce the impact of OP and optimize the data rate. Our numerical and simulation results are provided to prove the theoretical and analytical analysis. Thanks to these results, a great performance gain can be achieved for both TSR WSN-NOMA and PSR WSN-NOMA if optimal values of TS and PS ratios are found. In addition, the optimized TSR WSN-NOMA outperforms that of PSR WSN-NOMA in terms of OP.

10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2019.104068  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  The proper estimate of the risk of recurrences in early-stage oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) is mandatory for individual treatment-decision making. However, this remains a challenge even for experienced multidisciplinary centers. 
  Objectives:  We compared the performance of four machine learning (ML) algorithms for predicting the risk of locoregional recurrences in patients with OTSCC. These algorithms were Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Boosted Decision Tree (BDT), and Decision Forest (DF). 
  Materials and methods:  The study cohort comprised 311 cases from the five University Hospitals in Finland and A.C. Camargo Cancer Center, São Paulo, Brazil. For comparison of the algorithms, we used the harmonic mean of precision and recall called F1 score, specificity, and accuracy values. These algorithms and their corresponding permutation feature importance (PFI) with the input parameters were externally tested on 59 new cases. Furthermore, we compared the performance of the algorithm that showed the highest prediction accuracy with the prognostic significance of depth of invasion (DOI). 
  Results:  The results showed that the average specificity of all the algorithms was 71% . The SVM showed an accuracy of 68% and F1 score of 0.63, NB an accuracy of 70% and F1 score of 0.64, BDT an accuracy of 81% and F1 score of 0.78, and DF an accuracy of 78% and F1 score of 0.70. Additionally, these algorithms outperformed the DOI-based approach, which gave an accuracy of 63%. With PFI-analysis, there was no significant difference in the overall accuracies of three of the algorithms; PFI-BDT accuracy increased to 83.1%, PFI-DF increased to 80%, PFI-SVM decreased to 64.4%, while PFI-NB accuracy increased significantly to 81.4%. 
  Conclusions:  Our findings show that the best classification accuracy was achieved with the boosted decision tree algorithm. Additionally, these algorithms outperformed the DOI-based approach. Furthermore, with few parameters identified in the PFI analysis, ML technique still showed the ability to predict locoregional recurrence. The application of boosted decision tree machine learning algorithm can stratify OTSCC patients and thus aid in their individual treatment planning.

10.1007/s00330-019-06371-w  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Objectives:  To determine the integrative value of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT), transcriptomics data and clinicopathological data for predicting the survival of bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA) patients. 
  Methods:  RNA sequencing data, radiomics features and clinical parameters of 62 BLCA patients were included in the study. Then, prognostic signatures based on radiomics features and gene expression profile were constructed by using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox analysis. A multi-omics nomogram was developed by integrating radiomics, transcriptomics and clinicopathological data. More importantly, radiomics risk score-related genes were identified via weighted correlation network analysis and submitted to functional enrichment analysis. 
  Results:  The radiomics and transcriptomics signatures significantly stratified BLCA patients into high- and low-risk groups in terms of the progression-free interval (PFI). The two risk models remained independent prognostic factors in multivariate analyses after adjusting for clinical parameters. A nomogram was developed and showed an excellent predictive ability for the PFI in BLCA patients. Functional enrichment analysis suggested that the radiomics signature we developed could reflect the angiogenesis status of BLCA patients. 
  Conclusions:  The integrative nomogram incorporated CECT radiomics, transcriptomics and clinical features improved the PFI prediction in BLCA patients and is a feasible and practical reference for oncological precision medicine. 
  Key points:  • Our radiomics and transcriptomics models are proved robust for survival prediction in bladder urothelial carcinoma patients. • A multi-omics nomogram model which integrates radiomics, transcriptomics and clinical features for prediction of progression-free interval in bladder urothelial carcinoma is established. • Molecular functional enrichment analysis is used to reveal the potential molecular function of radiomics signature.

10.1016/j.jbi.2019.103364  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Machine learning has become ubiquitous and a key technology on mining electronic health records (EHRs) for facilitating clinical research and practice. Unsupervised machine learning, as opposed to supervised learning, has shown promise in identifying novel patterns and relations from EHRs without using human created labels. In this paper, we investigate the application of unsupervised machine learning models in discovering latent disease clusters and patient subgroups based on EHRs. We utilized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model, and proposed a novel model named Poisson Dirichlet Model (PDM), which extends the LDA approach using a Poisson distribution to model patients' disease diagnoses and to alleviate age and sex factors by considering both observed and expected observations. In the empirical experiments, we evaluated LDA and PDM on three patient cohorts, namely Osteoporosis, Delirium/Dementia, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)/Bronchiectasis Cohorts, with their EHR data retrieved from the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) medical records linkage system, for the discovery of latent disease clusters and patient subgroups. We compared the effectiveness of LDA and PDM in identifying disease clusters through the visualization of disease representations. We tested the performance of LDA and PDM in differentiating patient subgroups through survival analysis, as well as statistical analysis of demographics and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI) scores in those subgroups. The experimental results show that the proposed PDM could effectively identify distinguished disease clusters based on the latent patterns hidden in the EHR data by alleviating the impact of age and sex, and that LDA could stratify patients into differentiable subgroups with larger p-values than PDM. However, those subgroups identified by LDA are highly associated with patients' age and sex. The subgroups discovered by PDM might imply the underlying patterns of diseases of greater interest in epidemiology research due to the alleviation of age and sex. Both unsupervised machine learning approaches could be leveraged to discover patient subgroups using EHRs but with different foci.

10.1080/09513590.2019.1650345  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   It is essential that fertility treatment is individualized based on a thorough diagnostic work-up, with treatment tailored to the patients' requirements. This individualization should be kept in mind during the main decision points that occur before and during treatment. Treatment customization must include consideration of both the woman and her partner involved in the process together, including their collective treatment goals. Once treatment goals have been agreed and diagnostic evaluations performed, personalization based on patient characteristics, together with an understanding of treatment goals and patient preferences, enables the selection of appropriate treatments, protocols, products and their dosing. Following treatment initiation, monitoring and adaptation of product and dose can then ensure optimal outcomes. Currently, it is not possible to base treatment decisions on every characteristic of the patient and personalization is based on biomarkers that have been identified as the most relevant. However, in the future, the use of artificial intelligence coupled with continuous monitoring should enable greater individualization and improve outcomes. This review considers the current state-of-the-art related to decision points during individualized treatment of female infertility, before looking at future developments that might further assist in making individualized treatment decisions, including the use of computer-assisted decision making.

10.1016/j.media.2019.101625  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its early stage, e.g., mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is essential for timely treatment or possible intervention to slow down AD progression. Recent studies have demonstrated that multiple neuroimaging and biological measures contain complementary information for diagnosis and prognosis. Therefore, information fusion strategies with multi-modal neuroimaging data, such as voxel-based measures extracted from structural MRI (VBM-MRI) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), have shown their effectiveness for AD diagnosis. However, most existing methods are proposed to simply integrate the multi-modal data, but do not make full use of structure information across the different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal neuroimaging feature selection method with consistent metric constraint (MFCC) for AD analysis. First, the similarity is calculated for each modality (i.e. VBM-MRI or FDG-PET) individually by random forest strategy, which can extract pairwise similarity measures for multiple modalities. Then the group sparsity regularization term and the sample similarity constraint regularization term are used to constrain the objective function to conduct feature selection from multiple modalities. Finally, the multi-kernel support vector machine (MK-SVM) is used to fuse the features selected from different models for final classification. The experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) show that the proposed method has better classification performance than the start-of-the-art multimodality-based methods. Specifically, we achieved higher accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) for AD versus normal controls (NC), MCI versus NC, and MCI converters (MCI-C) versus MCI non-converters (MCI-NC) on ADNI datasets. Therefore, the proposed model not only outperforms the traditional method in terms of AD/MCI classification, but also discovers the characteristics associated with the disease, demonstrating its promise for improving disease-related mechanistic understanding.

10.1038/s41598-019-44852-6  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Artificial intelligence capabilities have, recently, greatly improved. In the past few years, one of the deep learning algorithms, the recurrent neural network (RNN), has shown an outstanding ability in sequence labeling and prediction tasks for sequential data. We built a reliable visual field prediction algorithm using RNN and evaluated its performance in comparison with the conventional pointwise ordinary linear regression (OLR) method. A total of 1,408 eyes were used as a training dataset and another dataset, comprising 281 eyes, was used as a test dataset. Five consecutive visual field tests were provided to the constructed RNN as input and a 6<sup>th</sup> visual field test was compared with the output of the RNN. The performance of the RNN was compared with that of OLR by predicting the 6<sup>th</sup> visual field in the test dataset. The overall prediction performance of RNN was significantly better than OLR. The pointwise prediction error of the RNN was significantly smaller than that of the OLR in most areas known to be vulnerable to glaucomatous damage. The RNN was also more robust and reliable regarding worsening in the visual field examination. In clinical practice, the RNN model can therefore assist in decision-making for further treatment of glaucoma.

10.1037/xge0000630  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Creative thinking drives progress not only in the arts but also, and perhaps especially, in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, and it is expected to become even more valuable than technical skill as artificial intelligence outpaces human cognition. Fostering creative thinkers has become a primary focus of educators. Educationally relevant anxieties, like math anxiety, have been shown to substantially impact specific forms of achievement and engagement, both in school and in career pursuits. Identifying these anxieties has led to promising interventions to enable affected individuals to reach their potential. Somewhat surprisingly, however, the possibility of anxiety specific to creative thinking is, to our knowledge, unexplored. In this article, across multiple samples, we tested the viability of creativity anxiety as a construct. We first created a new measure, the Creativity Anxiety Scale (CAS), demonstrating validity, internal reliability, and specificity. Applying the CAS revealed that creativity-specific anxiety predicted individual differences in creative achievement and attitudes toward creativity over and above effects of general anxiety. Moreover, across diverse content domains, from science to arts, anxiety was greater for situations that required creativity than similar situations that did not. Notably, this effect was especially pronounced in women. These findings suggest that creativity anxiety may have wide-reaching impacts and distinguish creativity anxiety from anxiety about noncreative aspects of performance. Establishing creativity anxiety as a novel construct, and the CAS as a valid measurement instrument, opens a new avenue of research that promises to deepen basic understanding of creative cognition and inform development of interventions to enable greater achievement of creative potential.

10.1097/CCO.0000000000000563  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Purpose of review:  Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are rapidly changing practice across different tumor settings. With this article, we reflect on how to assimilate the tsunami of ICIs data into clinical practice. 
  Recent findings:  A tremendous increase on approvals, number of publications, and clinical trials ongoing with ICIs on many different tumor types. 
  Summary:  ICIs are innovative treatments that are showing a significant benefit on different tumors. More approvals and an explosive increase of knowledge around the usage of ICI are to be expected in the near future, bringing new challenges on how to integrate this fast-growing evidence with ICI into clinical practice. To be updated, oncologists could follow approved guidelines from relevant societies and complement it with an appropriate search from publication databases. There are also some available courses, conferences and online material that are useful to improve knowledge in this so rapidly changing environment. In the future, we believe the integration of artificial intelligence and learning machines will play an important role to facilitate best clinical practices in different fields of medicine but particularly for oncology.

10.1007/978-3-030-16391-4_8  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Pancreas cancer is an aggressive and fatal disease that will become one of the leading causes of cancer mortality by 2030. An all-out effort is underway to better understand the basic biologic mechanisms of this disease ranging from early development to metastatic disease. In order to change the course of this disease, diagnostic radiology imaging may play a vital role in providing a precise, noninvasive method for early diagnosis and assessment of treatment response. Recent progress in combining medical imaging, advanced image analysis and artificial intelligence, termed radiomics, can offer an innovate approach in detecting the earliest changes of tumor development as well as a rapid method for the detection of response. In this chapter, we introduce the principles of radiomics and demonstrate how it can provide additional information into tumor biology, early detection, and response assessments advancing the goals of precision imaging to deliver the right treatment to the right person at the right time.

10.3389/fbioe.2019.00330  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   MicroRNAs (miRNA) have been identified as oncogenic drivers and tumor suppressors in every major cancer type. In this work, we design an artificial intelligent signal amplification (AISA) system including double-stranded SQ (S, signal strand; Q, quencher strand) and FP (F, fuel strand; P, protect strand) according to thermodynamics principle for sensitive detection of miRNA <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. In this AISA system for miRNA detection, strand S carries a quenched imaging marker inside the SQ. Target miRNA is constantly replaced by a reaction intermediate and circulatively participates in the reaction, similar to enzyme. Therefore, abundant fluorescent substances from S and SP are dissociated from excessive SQ for <i>in vitro and in vivo</i> visualization. The versatility and feasibility for disease diagnosis using this system were demonstrated by constructing two types of AISA system to detect Hsa-miR-484 and Hsa-miR-100, respectively. The minimum target concentration detected by the system <i>in vitro</i> (10 min after mixing) was 1/10th that of the control group. The precancerous lesions of liver cancer were diagnosed, and the detection accuracy were larger than 94% both in terms of location and concentration. The ability to establish this design framework for AISA system with high specificity provides a new way to monitor tumor progression and to assess therapeutic responses.

10.3390/ma12182864  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Experimental research of cutting force components during dry face milling operations are presented in the paper. The study was provided when milling of ductile cast iron alloyed with copper and its austempered ductile iron after the proper austempering process. In the study, virtual instrumentation designed for cutting forces components monitoring was used. During the research, orthogonal cutting forces components versus time were monitored and relationship of cutting forces components versus speed, feed and depth of cut were determined by artificial neural network and response surface methodology. An analysis was made regarding the consistency of the measured cutting forces and the values obtained from the model supported by an artificial neural network for the investigated interval of the cutting regime. Based on the results, an analysis of the feasibility of the application of austempered ductile iron in the industrial sector with the aspect of machinability as well as the application of the models based on artificial intelligence, was given. At the end of the presentation, the influence of the aforementioned cutting regimes on cutting force components is presented as well.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.06.053  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Classic serotonergic psychedelics are remarkable for their capacity to induce reversible alterations in consciousness of the self and the surroundings, mediated by agonism at serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors. The subjective effects elicited by dissociative drugs acting as N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists (e.g. ketamine and phencyclidine) overlap in certain domains with those of serotonergic psychedelics, suggesting some potential similarities in the brain activity patterns induced by both classes of drugs, despite different pharmacological mechanisms of action. We investigated source-localized magnetoencephalography recordings to determine the frequency-specific changes in oscillatory activity and long-range functional coupling that are common to two serotonergic compounds (lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD] and psilocybin) and the NMDA-antagonist ketamine. Administration of the three drugs resulted in widespread and broadband spectral power reductions. We established their similarity by using different pairs of compounds to train and subsequently evaluate multivariate machine learning classifiers. After applying the same methodology to functional connectivity values, we observed a pattern of occipital, parietal and frontal decreases in the low alpha and theta bands that were specific to LSD and psilocybin, as well as decreases in the low beta band common to the three drugs. Our results represent a first effort in the direction of quantifying the similarity of large-scale brain activity patterns induced by drugs of different mechanism of action, confirming the link between changes in theta and alpha oscillations and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> agonism, while also revealing the decoupling of activity in the beta band as an effect shared between NMDA antagonists and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> agonists. We discuss how these frequency-specific convergences and divergences in the power and functional connectivity of brain oscillations might relate to the overlapping subjective effects of serotonergic psychedelics and glutamatergic dissociative compounds.

10.12659/MSM.917299  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy is the commonest orbital disease in adults. However, shortcomings still exist in treatments. The aim of this study was to identify the efficacy and potential mechanism of gypenosides in the treatment of thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy. The Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform was screened for active compounds of gypenosides, and targets were predicted using Swiss Target Prediction. The targets of thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy were obtained from Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, Comparative Toxicogenomic Database and GeneCards Human gene database. Gene Ontology (GO), the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Reactome Pathways were determined based on the common targets. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to further understand of relationship among target genes, compounds and proteins. Molecular docking was performed to investigate the binding ability between gypenosides and hub genes. A total of 70 targets for gypenosides and 804 targets for thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy were obtained with 8 common targets identified. GO analysis and KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the hub genes were enriched in JAK-STAT, while Reactome pathways analysis indicated genes enriched in interleukin pathways. PPI network showed STAT1, STAT3, and STAT4 were at the center. Additionally, molecular docking indicated that STAT1 and STAT3 display good binding forces with gypenosides. This study indicates that target genes mainly enriched in JAK-STAT signaling pathway, particularly in STATs, which can be combined with gypenosides. This may suggest that gypenosides have curative effect on thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy via the JAK-STAT pathway.

10.1007/s11255-018-2044-1  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Purpose:  The purpose of the study was to assess the differences in the concentration and function of urinary proteins between patients with cystine stones (CYS) and healthy controls (HC). We postulated that CYS and HC groups would demonstrate different proteomic profiles. 
  Methods:  A pilot study was performed comparing urinary proteomes of 10 patients with CYS and 10 age- and gender-matched HC, using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Proteins which met the selection criteria (i) ≥ 2 unique peptide identifications; (ii) ≥ twofold difference in protein abundance; and (iii) ≤ 0.05 p value for the Fisher's Exact Test were analyzed using Gene Ontology classifications. 
  Results:  Of the 2097 proteins identified by proteomic analysis, 398 proteins were significantly different between CYS and HC. Of those, 191 were involved in transport processes and 61 in inflammatory responses. The majority were vesicle-mediated transport proteins (78.5%), and 1/3 of them were down-regulated; of those, 12 proteins were involved in endosomal transport (including 6 charged multivesicular body proteins (CHMP) and 3 vacuolar sorting-associated proteins) and 9 in transmembrane transport. Myosin-2 and two actin-related proteins were significantly up-regulated in the vesicle-mediated transport group. 
  Conclusion:  We provide proteomic evidence of impaired endocytosis, dysregulation of actin and myosin cytoskeleton, and inflammation in CYS. Endosomal transport proteins were down-regulated mainly through defective CHMP. These findings may contribute to further understanding of the pathogenesis of CYS, potentially affecting its management.

10.2214/AJR.18.20443  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Objective:  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential value of machine learning (ML)-based high-dimensional quantitative CT texture analysis in predicting the mutation status of the gene encoding the protein polybromo-1 (PBRM1) in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC). 
  Materials and methods:  In this retrospective study, 45 patients with clear cell RCC (29 without the PBRM1 mutation and 16 with the PBRM1 mutation) were identified in The Cancer Genome Atlas-Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma database. To create stable ML models and balanced classes, the data were augmented to a total of 161 labeled segmentations (87 without the PBRM1 mutation and 74 with the PBRM1 mutation) by obtaining three to five different samples per patient. Texture features were extracted from corticomedullary phase contrast-enhanced CT images with the use of an open-source software package for the extraction of radiomic data from medical images. Reproducibility analysis (intraclass correlation) was performed by two radiologists. Attribute selection and model optimization were done using a wrapper-based classifier-specific algorithm with nested cross-validation. ML classifiers were an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm and a random forest (RF) algorithm. The models were validated using 10-fold cross-validation. The reference standard was the PBRM1 mutation status. The main performance metric was the AUC value. 
  Results:  Of 828 extracted texture features, 759 had excellent reproducibility. Using 10 selected features, the ANN algorithm correctly classified 88.2% (142 of 161) of the clear cell RCCs in terms of PBRM1 mutation status (AUC value, 0.925). Using five selected features, the RF algorithm correctly classified 95.0% (153 of 161) of the clear cell RCCs (AUC value, 0.987). Overall, the RF algorithm performed better than the ANN algorithm (z score = -2.677; p = 0.007). 
  Conclusion:  ML-based high-dimensional quantitative CT texture analysis might be a feasible and potential method for predicting PBRM1 mutation status in patients with clear cell RCC.

10.1111/nph.15692  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Biotrophic fungal plant pathogens can balance their virulence and form intricate relationships with their hosts. Sometimes, this leads to systemic host colonization over long time scales without macroscopic symptoms. However, how plant-pathogenic endophytes manage to establish their sustained systemic infection remains largely unknown. Here, we present a genomic and transcriptomic analysis of Thecaphora thlaspeos. This relative of the well studied grass smut Ustilago maydis is the only smut fungus adapted to Brassicaceae hosts. Its ability to overwinter with perennial hosts and its systemic plant infection including roots are unique characteristics among smut fungi. The T. thlaspeos genome was assembled to the chromosome level. It is a typical smut genome in terms of size and genome characteristics. In silico prediction of candidate effector genes revealed common smut effector proteins and unique members. For three candidates, we have functionally demonstrated effector activity. One of these, TtTue1, suggests a potential link to cold acclimation. On the plant side, we found evidence for a typical immune response as it is present in other infection systems, despite the absence of any macroscopic symptoms during infection. Our findings suggest that T. thlaspeos distinctly balances its virulence during biotrophic growth ultimately allowing for long-lived infection of its perennial hosts.

10.1371/journal.pone.0214857  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease. In recent years, considerable evidence has indicated that Gene Ontology (GO) functions, especially GO-biological processes, have important effects on the mechanisms and treatments of different diseases. However, the roles of GO functions in the pathogenesis and treatment of MG have not been well studied. This study aimed to uncover the potential important roles of risk-related GO functions and to screen significant candidate drugs related to GO functions for MG. Based on MG risk genes, 238 risk GO functions and 42 drugs were identified. Through constructing a GO function network, we discovered that positive regulation of NF-kappaB transcription factor activity (GO:0051092) may be one of the most important GO functions in the mechanism of MG. Furthermore, we built a drug-GO function network to help evaluate the latent relationship between drugs and GO functions. According to the drug-GO function network, 5 candidate drugs showing promise for treating MG were identified. Indeed, 2 out of 5 candidate drugs have been investigated to treat MG. Through functional enrichment analysis, we found that the mechanisms between 5 candidate drugs and associated GO functions may involve two vital pathways, specifically hsa05332 (graft-versus-host disease) and hsa04940 (type I diabetes mellitus). More interestingly, most of the processes in these two pathways were consistent. Our study will not only reveal a new perspective on the mechanisms and novel treatment strategies of MG, but also will provide strong support for research on GO functions.

The side-form general antioxidant function-specific role of each Msr isoform has not been fully studied. Thirty homologous genes of Msr type A (MsrA) and type B (MsrB) that originate from the genomes of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, <i>Populus trichocarpa,</i> and <i>Oryza sativa</i> were analyzed in silico. From 109 to 201 transcription factors and responsive elements were predicted for each gene. Among the species, 220 and 190 common transcription factors and responsive elements were detected for the <i>MsrA</i> and <i>MsrB</i> isoforms, respectively. In a comparison of 14 <i>MsrA</i> and 16 <i>MsrB</i> genes, 424 transcription factors and responsive elements were reported in both types of genes, with almost ten times fewer unique elements. The transcription factors mainly comprised plant growth and development regulators, transcription factors important in stress responses with significant overrepresentation of the myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (MYB) and no apical meristem, Arabidopsis transcription activation factor and cup-shaped cotyledon (NAC) families and responsive elements sensitive to ethylene, jasmonate, sugar, and prolamine. Gene Ontology term-based functional classification revealed that cellular, metabolic, and developmental process terms and the response to stimulus term dominated in the biological process category. Available experimental transcriptomic and proteomic data, in combination with a set of predictions, gave coherent results validating this research. Thus, new manners <i>Msr</i> gene expression regulation, as well as new putative roles of Msrs, are proposed.

10.12659/MSM.917375  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   BACKGROUND Osteosarcoma (OS) is a common primary malignant bone tumor for which the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Studies on coding and non-coding RNAs are needed to determine the molecular mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS To explore the potential roles of miRNAs and mRNA in OS, we determined the miRNA and mRNA expression profile of 3 pairs of OS and paracancerous tissues from patients with OS by sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. The expression levels of critical miRNAs and mRNAs were verified in 10 pairs of OS and paracancerous tissues. An miRNA inhibitor and mimics were used to investigate the interactions between miRNAs and target genes. The cell counting kit-8 assay was performed to evaluate OS cell proliferation after miRNA interference. RESULTS A total of 184 miRNAs and 2501 mRNAs were identified (fold-change &gt;2.0 or &lt;2.0, P&lt;0.05), with up-regulation of 82 miRNAs and 1320 mRNAs and down-regulation of 102 miRNAs and 1181 mRNAs in OS tissue. The protein protein interaction network revealed that UQCRC1 (ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core protein 1) is a critical gene and a potential target gene of miR-214-3p. Both UQCRC1 and miR-214-3p were significantly differentially expressed in OS tissue and cell lines (down and up-regulated, respectively). Down-regulated miR-214-3p expression increased UQCRC1 expression and suppressed OS cell proliferation. In contrast, overexpression of miR-214-3p decreased UQCRC1 expression and promoted OS cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS High miR-214-3p expression may promote OS cell proliferation by targeting UQCRC1, providing insight into a potential therapeutic target for preventing and treating OS.

10.1186/s12967-018-1761-7  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the major risk factors of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Increasing evidence indicates that microRNA (miRNA)-mRNA axis is involved in HCC. However, a comprehensive miRNA-mRNA regulatory network in HBV-related HCC is still absent. This study aims to identify potential miRNA-mRNA regulatory pathways contributing to pathogenesis of HBV-related HCC. 
  Methods:  Microarray GSE69580 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. GEO2R and 'R-limma' were used to conduct differential expression analysis. The common miRNAs appeared in the two analytic sets were screened as potential differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs). The prognostic roles of screened DE-miRNAs in HCC were further evaluated using Kaplan-Meier plotter database. Target genes of DE-miRNAs were predicted by miRNet. Then, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were established for these targets via the STRING database, after which hub genes in the networks were identified by Cytoscape. Functional annotation and pathway enrichment analyses for the target genes were performed through DAVID database. Three enriched pathways related to HBV-related HCC were selected for further analysis and potential target genes commonly appeared in all three pathways were screened. Cytoscape was employed to construct miRNA-hub gene network. The expression and correlation of potential miRNAs and targets were further detected in clinical HBV-related HCC samples by qRT-PCR. 
  Results:  7 upregulated and 9 downregulated DE-miRNAs were accessed. 5 of 7 upregulated DE-miRNAs and 5 of 7 downregulated DE-miRNAs indicated significant prognostic roles in HCC. 2312 and 1175 target genes were predicted for the upregulated and downregulated DE-miRNAs, respectively. TP53 was identified as the hub gene in the PPI networks. Pathway enrichment analysis suggested that these predicted targets were linked to hepatitis B, pathways in cancer, microRNAs in cancer and viral carcinogenesis. Further analysis of these pathways screened 20 and 16 target genes for upregulated and downregulated DE-miRNAs, respectively. By detecting the expression of 36 target genes, six candidate target genes were identified. Finally, a potential miRNA-mRNA regulatory network was established based on the results of qRT-PCR and expression correlation analysis. 
  Conclusions:  In the study, potential miRNA-mRNA regulatory pathways were identified, exploring the underlying pathogenesis and effective therapy strategy of HBV-related HCC.

10.1371/journal.pone.0223173  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Sugar transporters play a crucial role for plant productivity, as they coordinate sugar fluxes from source leaf towards sink organs (seed, fruit, root) and regulate the supply of carbon resources towards the microorganisms of the rhizosphere (bacteria and fungi). Thus, sugar fluxes mediated by SUT (sucrose transporters), MST (monosaccharide transporters) and SWEET (sugar will eventually be exported transporters) families are key determinants of crop yield and shape the microbial communities living in the soil. In this work, we performed a systematic search for sugar transporters in Fabaceae genomes, focusing on model and agronomical plants. Here, we update the inventory of sugar transporter families mining the latest version of the Medicago truncatula genome and identify for the first time SUT MST and SWEET families of the agricultural crop Pisum sativum. The sugar transporter families of these Fabaceae species comprise respectively 7 MtSUT 7 PsSUT, 72 MtMST 59 PsMST and 26 MtSWEET 22 PsSWEET. Our comprehensive phylogenetic analysis sets a milestone for the scientific community, as we propose a new and simple nomenclature to correctly name SUT MST and SWEET families. Then, we searched for transcriptomic data available for our gene repertoire. We show that several clusters of homologous genes are co-expressed in different organs, suggesting that orthologous sugar transporters may have a conserved function. We focused our analysis on gene candidates that may be involved in remobilizing resources during flowering, grain filling and in allocating carbon towards roots colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and Rhizobia. Our findings open new perspectives for agroecological applications in legume crops, as for instance improving the yield and quality of seed productions and promoting the use of symbiotic microorganisms.

Although its pathophysiology is largely unknown, immune-inflammatory pathways may be involved. We examined serum interleukin (IL)-6, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), CXCL-8, and IL-10 in 67 female FM patients and 35 healthy women while adjusting for age, body mass index (BMI), and comorbid disorders. We scored the Fibromyalgia Severity Score, Widespread Pain Index (WPI), Symptom Severity Scale (SSS), Hospital Anxiety (HADS-A), and Depression Scale and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). Clinical rating scales were significantly higher in FM patients than in controls. After adjusting for covariates, IL-6, IL-10, and CXCL-8 were lower in FM than in HC, whereas hs-CRP did not show any difference. Binary regression analyses showed that the diagnosis FM was associated with lowered IL-10, quality of sleep, aerobic activities, and increased HADS-A and comorbidities. Neural networks showed that WPI was best predicted by quality of sleep, PSS-10, HADS-A, and the cytokines, while SSS was best predicted by PSS-10, HADS-A, and IL-10. Lowered levels of cytokines are associated with FM independently from confounders. Lowered IL-6 and IL-10 signaling may play a role in the pathophysiology of FM.

10.1038/s41467-019-09278-8  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The architecture of mouse and human antibody repertoires is defined by the sequence similarity networks of the clones that compose them. The major principles that define the architecture of antibody repertoires have remained largely unknown. Here, we establish a high-performance computing platform to construct large-scale networks from comprehensive human and murine antibody repertoire sequencing datasets (&gt;100,000 unique sequences). Leveraging a network-based statistical framework, we identify three fundamental principles of antibody repertoire architecture: reproducibility, robustness and redundancy. Antibody repertoire networks are highly reproducible across individuals despite high antibody sequence dissimilarity. The architecture of antibody repertoires is robust to the removal of up to 50-90% of randomly selected clones, but fragile to the removal of public clones shared among individuals. Finally, repertoire architecture is intrinsically redundant. Our analysis provides guidelines for the large-scale network analysis of immune repertoires and may be used in the future to define disease-associated and synthetic repertoires.

10.3390/s19071740  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The neuroimaging techniques such as dopaminergic imaging using Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) with <sup>99m</sup>Tc-TRODAT-1 have been employed to detect the stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). In this retrospective study, a total of 202 <sup>99m</sup>Tc-TRODAT-1 SPECT imaging were collected. All of the PD patient cases were separated into mild (HYS Stage 1 to Stage 3) and severe (HYS Stage 4 and Stage 5) PD, according to the Hoehn and Yahr Scale (HYS) standard. A three-dimensional method was used to estimate six features of activity distribution and striatal activity volume in the images. These features were skewness, kurtosis, Cyhelsky's skewness coefficient, Pearson's median skewness, dopamine transporter activity volume, and dopamine transporter activity maximum. Finally, the data were modeled using logistic regression (LR) and support vector machine (SVM) for PD classification. The results showed that SVM classifier method produced a higher accuracy than LR. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, accuracy, and AUC with SVM method were 0.82, 1.00, 0.84, 0.67, 0.83, and 0.85, respectively. Additionally, the Kappa value was shown to reach 0.68. This claimed that the SVM-based model could provide further reference for PD stage classification in medical diagnosis. In the future, more healthy cases will be expected to clarify the false positive rate in this classification model.

  Methods:  A DTI scan was performed in 77 patients and 67 normal controls. A fractional anisotropy map was generated by DTIFit. TBSS was used to find the region where the FA differed between the case and control groups. Each resulting FA value image is registered with each other to create an average FA value skeleton. Each resultant FA skeleton image was connected to feature vectors, and features with significant differences were extracted and classified using a support vector machine (SVM). Next, brain segmentation was performed on each subject's DTI image using automated anatomical labeling (AAL), and deterministic white matter fiber bundle tracking was performed to generate symmetrical brain matrix, select the upper triangular component as a classification feature. Two-sample t-test was used to extract the features with significant differences, then classified by SVM. Finally, we adopted a permutation test and ROC curves to evaluate the reliability of the classifier. 
  Results:  For FA, the accuracy of classification between the 0-6, 6-12 and &gt; 12 months post-RT groups and the control group was 84.5, 83.9 and 74.5%, respectively. In the case groups, the FA with discriminative ability was reduced, mainly in the bilateral cerebellum and bilateral temporal lobe, with prolonged time, the damage was aggravated. For WM connections, the SVM classifier classification recognition rates of the 0-6, 6-12 and &gt; 12 months post-RT groups reached 82.5, 78.4 and 76.3%, respectively. The WM connections with discriminative ability were reduced. 
  Conclusions:  RBI is a disease involving whole brain WM network anomalies. These brain discriminating WM regions and WM connection modes can supplement the understanding of RBI and be used as biomarkers for the early clinical diagnosis of RBI.
