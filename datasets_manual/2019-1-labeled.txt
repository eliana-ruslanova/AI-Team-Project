10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.03.115  |  None  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Blueberry is one of the richest phenolic sources, providing health benefits. To study blueberry phenolic biosynthesis, we investigated phenolics and proteomics at three typical fruit maturation phases. Multiple isoforms of enzymes and multiple members of transcription factors involved in phenolic biosynthesis were divergent and differently regulated. Regulation of some proteins resulted in change of phenolic content. During fruit maturation, down-regulation of VcOMT (CUFF.177.1) and VcLAR2 (CUFF.16780.1) was associated with decreases of ferulic acid and catechin, respectively; Up-regulation of VcFLS (CUFF.41155.1), and VcF3'5'H (CUFF.51711.1) and VcF3'5'H (gene.g10884.t1.1) likely drove increases of their products (quercetin and myricetin); Up-regulation of VcUFGALT (CUFF.20951.1) and VcUFGT73 (4333_g.1) and down-regulation of VcU5GT (CUFF.51258.1) were correlated to accumulation of anthocyanins with 3-glucoside/galactoside. Additionally, four TFs, VcAPRR2 (CUFF.24826.1), VcbHLH3 (CUFF.37765.1), VcWD (CUFF.28282.2) and VcWD (CUFF.28273.1) were probably related to regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis. These proteins were potential targets for genetic improvement in a breeding program.

Similarly, the use of orbital angular momentum of light as a new degree of freedom for information processing can further improve the bandwidth of optical communications. However, due to the lack of orbital angular momentum selectivity in the design of conventional holograms, their utilization as an information carrier for holography has never been implemented. Here we demonstrate metasurface orbital angular momentum holography by utilizing strong orbital angular momentum selectivity offered by meta-holograms consisting of GaN nanopillars with discrete spatial frequency distributions. The reported orbital angular momentum-multiplexing allows lensless reconstruction of a range of distinctive orbital angular momentum-dependent holographic images. The results pave the way to the realization of ultrahigh-capacity holographic devices harnessing the previously inaccessible orbital angular momentum multiplexing.

The effects of structural parameters on the extinction spectrum and refractive index (RI) sensitivity are analyzed to obtain optimal parameters. In particular, the RI sensitivity can reach 550.08 nm/RIU through improvement of the sensor structure, which is an increase of 17.4% over the original value. After coating a methane-sensitive membrane on the inner and outer surfaces of the gold rings, the methane concentration can be accurately measured with a gas sensitivity of -1.02 nm/%. The proposed method is also applicable to quantitative analyses of components concentration and qualitative analyses of gas composition.

10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.087  |  None  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   In aquatic ecosystems, both phytoplankton and bacteria play pivotal roles. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, considerable research focused on phytoplankton colony attached and free-living bacteria has revealed the close relationship between them, and indicated that the entire bacterial community mediates crucial biogeochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems. However, our understanding of their distribution patterns and response to environmental factors remains poor. Besides, picocyanobacteria, which were omitted from attached bacteria analysis, were reported to be important in cyanobacterial blooms. To explore the spatiotemporal variation of the entire bacterial community with their driving environmental factors and detect the relationships among them, we collected 61 water samples spanning one year and the entire Lake Taihu regions for surveying the entire bacterial community. Our results indicated: 1) seasonal variation of the bacterial community composition was stronger than spatial variation due to the clearly seasonal variation of Microcystis, Synechococcus (pico-cyanobacteria) and other bacteria (Actinomycetales, Pirellulaceae and Sphingobacteriaceae); 2) the spatial distribution of the bacterial community showed that different phyla were dominant in different regions; 3) the bacterial co-occurrence networks varied seasonally and were dominated by Microcystis, ACK-M1, Chthoniobacteraceae, Synechococcus, Pirellulaceae and Pelagibacteraceae; 4) phytoplankton density, chlorophyll a, water temperature and total nitrogen were the major factors that drove the spatiotemporal variation of bacterial community composition. This study revealed the seasonal succession and spatial distribution of the entire bacterial community in Lake Taihu, providing new insights into the relationship between water bloom-forming cyanobacterial species and other bacteria, and their response to environmental factors in eutrophic freshwater ecosystem.

Recent studies have demonstrated that long non-coding RNA and micro RNA can interact through various mechanisms to regulate mRNA. Yet the gene-gene interaction has not been investigated in coronary heart disease (CHD). 
  Methods:  High throughput sequencing were used to identify differentially expressed (DE) lncRNA, miRNA, and mRNA profiles between CHD and healthy control. Gene Oncology (GO), KEGG enrichment analysis were performed. Gene-gene interaction network were constructed and pivotal genes were screened out. Lentivirus-induced shRNA infection and qRT-PCR were performed to validated the gene-gene interactions. 
  Results:  A total of 62 lncRNAs, 332 miRNAs and 366 mRNAs were differentially expressed between CHD and healthy control. GO and KEGG analysis show that immune related molecular mechanisms and biological processes play a role in CHD. The gene-gene interaction network were constructed and visualized based on Pearson correlation coefficients and starBase database. 6 miRNAs in the network were significantly correlated to left ventricular ejection fraction, total choleterol and homocysteine. 2 lncRNAs (CTA-384D8.35 and CTB-114C7.4 (refseq entry LOC100128059)), 1 miRNA (miR-4497), and 1 mRNA (NR4A1) were the pivotal genes. Lentivirus-induced shRNA infection and qRT-PCR had validated the pivotal gene-gene interactions. 
  Conclusions:  These results have shown the potential of lncRNA, miRNA, and mRNA as clinical biomarkers and in elucidating pathological mechanisms of CHD from a transcriptomic perspective.

10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2019.07.008  |  Diagnosis  |  Prognosis  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Objective:  Lipid peroxidation constitutes a molecular mechanism involved in early Alzheimer Disease (AD) stages, and artificial neural network (ANN) analysis is a promising non-linear regression model, characterized by its high flexibility and utility in clinical diagnosis. ANN simulates neuron learning procedures and it could provide good diagnostic performances in this complex and heterogeneous disease compared with linear regression analysis. 
  Design and methods:  In our study, a new set of lipid peroxidation compounds were determined in urine and plasma samples from patients diagnosed with early Alzheimer Disease (n = 70) and healthy controls (n = 26) by means of ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass-spectrometry. Then, a model based on ANN was developed to classify groups of participants. 
  Results:  The diagnostic performances obtained using an ANN model for each biological matrix were compared with the corresponding linear regression model based on partial least squares (PLS), and with the non-linear (radial and polynomial) support vector machine (SVM) models. Better accuracy, in terms of receiver operating characteristic-area under curve (ROC-AUC), was obtained for the ANN models (ROC-AUC 0.882 in plasma and 0.839 in urine) than for PLS and SVM models. 
  Conclusion:  Lipid peroxidation and ANN constitute a useful approach to establish a reliable diagnosis when the prognosis is complex, multidimensional and non-linear.

For this reason, a detailed assessment of periods in which changes in climate conditions affect the number of human cases may improve the timing of vector-control efforts. In this work, we develop new machine-learning algorithms to analyze climate time series and their connection to the occurrence of dengue epidemic years for seven Brazilian state capitals. Our method explores the impact of two key variables-frequency of precipitation and average temperature-during a wide range of time windows in the annual cycle. Our results indicate that each Brazilian state capital considered has its own climate signatures that correlate with the overall number of human dengue-cases. However, for most of the studied cities, the winter preceding an epidemic year shows a strong predictive power. Understanding such climate contributions to the vector's biology could lead to more accurate prediction models and early warning systems.

To address this problem, some Intelligent Transport Systems (ITSs) have been implemented in order to count vehicles with already established video surveillance infrastructure. With this in mind, in this paper, we present an on-line learning methodology for counting vehicles in video sequences based on Incremental Principal Component Analysis (Incremental PCA). This incremental learning method allows us to identify the maximum variability (i.e., motion detection) between a previous block of frames and the actual one by using only the first projected eigenvector. Once the projected image is obtained, we apply dynamic thresholding to perform image binarization. Then, a series of post-processing steps are applied to enhance the binary image containing the objects in motion. Finally, we count the number of vehicles by implementing a virtual detection line in each of the road lanes. These lines determine the instants where the vehicles pass completely through them. Results show that our proposed methodology is able to count vehicles with 96.6% accuracy at 26 frames per second on average-dealing with both camera jitter and sudden illumination changes caused by the environment and the camera auto exposure.

The performance of approaches for daily activity recognition is therefore crucial, but current real-time approaches have to wait until a daily activity ends before performing recognition. We present an approach for timely daily activity recognition from an incomplete stream of sensor events, by which the recognition process can start as soon as a daily activity begins. Activity features are generated from several headmost sensor events rather than from all sensor events that a daily activity activated. A public dataset was utilized to evaluate the presented method. Experimental findings show its effectiveness for timely daily activity recognition in terms of precision, recall, average saved time, and saved time proportion.

The method finds out interesting parts of the video by discarding the remaining parts of the video. The abstracts thus generated enhances browsing and retrieval of video data. The quality of summaries generated by video summarization algorithms can be improved if the redundant frames in the input video are taken care of before summarization. This paper presents a novel domain-independent method for redundancy elimination from input videos before summarization maintaining keyframes in the original video. The frames of input video are first presampled by selecting two frames in one second. The flow vectors between consecutive frames are computed using SIFT Flow algorithm. The magnitude of flow vectors at each pixel position of the frame are summed up to find the displacement magnitude between the consecutive frames. The redundant frames are filtered out based on local averaging of the displacement values. The evaluation of the method is done using two standard datasets namely VSUMM and OVP. The results demonstrate that an average reduction rate of 97.64% is achieved consistently on videos of all categories. The method also gives superior results compared to other state-of-the-art redundancy elimination methods for video summarization.

10.3390/s19245499  |  Smart Healthcare  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   A gait event is a crucial step towards the effective assessment and rehabilitation of motor dysfunctions. However, for the data acquisition of a three-dimensional motion capture (3D Mo-Cap) system, the high cost of setups, such as the high standard laboratory environment, limits widespread clinical application. Inertial sensors are increasingly being used to recognize and classify physical activities in a variety of applications. Inertial sensors are now sufficiently small in size and light in weight to be part of a body sensor network for the collection of human gait data. The acceleration signal has found important applications in human gait recognition. In this paper, using the experimental data from the heel and toe, first the wavelet method was used to remove noise from the acceleration signal, then, based on the threshold of comprehensive change rate of the acceleration signal, the signal was primarily segmented. Subsequently, the vertical acceleration signals, from heel and toe, were integrated twice, to compute their respective vertical displacement. Four gait events were determined in the segmented signal, based on the characteristics of the vertical displacement of heel and toe. The results indicated that the gait events were consistent with the synchronous record of the motion capture system. The method has achieved gait event subdivision, while it has also ensured the accuracy of the defined gait events. The work acts as a valuable reference, to further study gait recognition.

Furthermore, interactions among the glomerular, tubular, and interstitial cells contribute to the process by excessive synthesis and decreased degradation of extracellular matrix. The morphology of kidney is different from pathological stages of diseases and changes with various causes. At the end stage of the disease, the kidneys are symmetrically contracted with diffuse granules. Most glomeruli show diffuse fibrosis and hyaline degeneration, and intervening tubules become atrophied. Renal interstitium shows obvious hyperplasia of fibrous tissues with marked infiltration of lymphocytes, mononuclear cells, and plasma cells. The renal arterioles are wall thickening frequently because of hyaline degeneration. Morphologic analysis based on Masson staining of the kidney tissues has been regarded as the golden standard to evaluate the visual fibrosis. However, the present studies have found that the evaluation system has poor repeatability. Several computer-aided image analysis techniques have been used to assess interstitial fibrosis. It is possible that the evaluation of renal fibrosis is carried out by the artificial intelligence renal biopsy pathological diagnosis system in the near future.

We stressed on the importance of the development of a standardized phantom and quantitative analysis of diagnostic image quality using it, especially in the aspect of psychophysical properties of these digital systems. There is no missing link in the image quality assessment in digital intraoral radiography and cone-beam computed tomography in dental use. However, there are missing links between physical and diagnostic image qualities in panoramic radiography. The development of a semi-standardized phantom and the corresponding quantitative analysis method for image quality may be required in digital panoramic radiography. Quantitative image quality assessment using a standardized phantom will also be promising in the future artificial intelligence era.

10.34133/2019/1608396  |  Robotics  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Concepts from mathematical crystallography and group theory are used here to quantize the group of rigid-body motions, resulting in a "motion alphabet" with which robot motion primitives are expressed. From these primitives it is possible to develop a dictionary of physical actions. Equipped with an alphabet of the sort developed here, intelligent actions of robots in the world can be approximated with finite sequences of characters, thereby forming the foundation of a language in which robot motion is articulated. In particular, we use the discrete handedness-preserving symmetries of macromolecular crystals (known in mathematical crystallography as Sohncke space groups) to form a coarse discretization of the space SE(3) of rigid-body motions. This discretization is made finer by subdividing using the concept of double-coset decomposition. More specifically, a very efficient, equivolumetric quantization of spatial motion can be defined using the group-theoretic concept of a double-coset decomposition of the form Γ\SE(3)/Δ, where Γ is a Sohncke space group and Δ is a finite group of rotational symmetries such as those of the icosahedron. The resulting discrete alphabet is based on a very uniform sampling of SE(3) and is a tool for describing the continuous trajectories of robots and humans. An efficient coarse-to-fine search algorithm is presented to round off any motion sampled from the continuous group of motions to the nearest element of our alphabet. It is shown that our alphabet and this efficient rounding algorithm can be used as a geometric data structure to accelerate the performance of other sampling schemes designed for desirable dispersion or discrepancy properties. Moreover, the general "signals to symbols" problem in artificial intelligence is cast in this framework for robots moving continuously in the world.

10.1186/s12874-019-0708-x  |  Prognosis  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Chronic respiratory symptoms involving bronchitis, cough and phlegm in children are underappreciated but pose a significant public health burden. Efforts for prevention and management could be supported by an understanding of the relative importance of determinants, including environmental exposures. Thus, we aim to develop a prediction model for bronchitic symptoms. 
  Methods:  Schoolchildren from the population-based southern California Children's Health Study were visited annually from 2003 to 2012. Bronchitic symptoms over the prior 12 months were assessed by questionnaire. A gradient boosting model was fit using groups of risk factors (including traffic/air pollution exposures) for all children and by asthma status. Training data consisted of one observation per participant in a random study year (for 50% of participants). Validation data consisted of: (1) a random (later) year in the same participants (within-participant); (2) a random year in participants excluded from the training data (across-participant). 
  Results:  At baseline, 13.2% of children had asthma and 18.1% reported bronchitic symptoms. Models performed similarly within- and across-participant. Previous year symptoms/medication use provided much of the predictive ability (across-participant area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC): 0.76 vs 0.78 for all risk factors, in all participants). Traffic/air pollution exposures added modestly to prediction as did body mass index percentile, age and parent stress. 
  Conclusions:  Regardless of asthma status, previous symptoms were the most important predictors of current symptoms. Traffic/air pollution variables contribute modest predictive information, but impact large populations. Methods proposed here could be generalized to personalized exacerbation predictions in future longitudinal studies to support targeted prevention efforts.

Using experimental fitness data and implementing artificial intelligence and a computational mutagenesis technique, we developed models that reliably predict fitness for all single residue mutants of H-<i>ras</i> proto-oncogene protein p21. The computational mutagenesis generated a feature vector of protein structural changes for each variant, and these data correlated well with fitness. Random forest classification and tree regression machine learning algorithms were implemented for training predictive models. Cross-validations were used to evaluate model performance, and control experiments were performed to assess statistical significance. Classification models revealed a balanced accuracy rate as high as 82%, with a Matthew's correlation of 0.63, and an area under ROC curve of 0.90. Similarly, regression models displayed Pearson's correlation reaching 0.79. On the other hand, control data sets led to performance values consistent with random guessing. Comparisons with several related state-of-the-art methods reflected favorably on our trained models. This H-Ras proof-of-principle study suggests a complementary approach for understanding mechanisms with which other proteins are involved in oncogenesis, including related Ras isoforms, and for providing useful insights into designing future diagnostic and treatment modalities.

We assessed histological clot composition in a series of patients with large vessel occlusion and investigated correlations between clot composition and stroke pathogenesis. Methods- As part of the multi-institutional STRIP registry (Stroke Thromboembolism Registry of Imaging and Pathology), consecutive emboli retrieved during mechanical thrombectomy were stained using Martius Scarlett Blue and analyzed using machine learning software. We assessed proportions of red blood cells, fibrin, platelets, and white blood cells. Correlations between clot components and stroke pathogenesis (large artery atherosclerosis, cardioembolism, and stroke of undetermined pathogenesis) were assessed using SPSS22. Results- One hundred five patients were included. The proportion of platelet-rich clots (55.0% versus 21.2%; P=0.005) and percentage of platelet content (22.1±4.2% versus 13.9±14.2%; P=0.03) was significantly higher in the large artery atherosclerosis group compared with the cardioembolic group. The proportion of platelet-rich clots (50.0% versus 21.2%; P=0.024) was also significantly higher in the cryptogenic group compared with cardioembolic cases. Large artery atherosclerosis and cryptogenic cases had a similar proportion of platelet-rich clots (55.0% versus 50.0%; P=0.636). There was no significant difference between stroke pathogenesis and the other major clot components. Conclusions- High platelet content of emboli is associated with a large artery atherosclerosis etiology of large vessel occlusion.

Whole genome sequencing of clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates promises to circumvent the long wait times and limited scope of conventional phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility, but gaps remain for predicting phenotype accurately from genotypic data especially for certain drugs. Our primary aim was to perform an exploration of statistical learning algorithms and genetic predictor sets using a rich dataset to build a high performing and fast predicting model to detect anti-tuberculosis drug resistance. 
  Methods:  We collected targeted or whole genome sequencing and conventional drug resistance phenotyping data from 3601 Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains enriched for resistance to first- and second-line drugs, with 1228 multidrug resistant strains. We investigated the utility of (1) rare variants and variants known to be determinants of resistance for at least one drug and (2) machine and statistical learning architectures in predicting phenotypic drug resistance to 10 anti-tuberculosis drugs. Specifically, we investigated multitask and single task wide and deep neural networks, a multilayer perceptron, regularized logistic regression, and random forest classifiers. 
  Findings:  The highest performing machine and statistical learning methods included both rare variants and those known to be causal of resistance for at least one drug. Both simpler L2 penalized regression and complex machine learning models had high predictive performance. The average AUCs for our highest performing model was 0.979 for first-line drugs and 0.936 for second-line drugs during repeated cross-validation. On an independent validation set, the highest performing model showed average AUCs, sensitivities, and specificities, respectively, of 0.937, 87.9%, and 92.7% for first-line drugs and 0.891, 82.0% and 90.1% for second-line drugs. Our method outperforms existing approaches based on direct association, with increased sum of sensitivity and specificity of 11.7% on first line drugs and 3.2% on second line drugs. Our method has higher predictive performance compared to previously reported machine learning models during cross-validation, with higher AUCs for 8 of 10 drugs. 
  Interpretation:  Statistical models, especially those that are trained using both frequent and less frequent variants, significantly improve the accuracy of resistance prediction and hold promise in bringing sequencing technologies closer to the bedside.

In the present study, we divided 120 common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) into two groups including control group and CPF group, CPF group was exposed to 14.5 μg/L CPF for 30 d. 17 miRNAs were differentially expressed in CPF group head kidney tissues according to the results of miRNAome analysis. In addition, histopathological examination and electron microscopy proved that CPF exposure could lead to damage of head kidney and obvious apoptosis characteristics. The possible target genes of miRNA were predicted using online target gene prediction websites, miRNAome sequencing, GO and KEGG enrichment. miRNAome results showed that expression of miR-731 and miR-2188-3p in CPF group was 0.48 time and 0.45 time as control group, respectively. qRT-PCR results proved the reality of miRNAome. During CPF exposure, mRNA expression of TLR pathway genes and its downstream genes involved in autophagy and apoptosis pathway including TLR1, TLR2, TLR7, TLR9, MyD88, IRAK1, IRAK4, IRF7, PI3K, AKT, mTOR, Caspase3, Caspase8 and Bax were differentially increased under CPF exposure, along with ATG13 and Bcl2 decreased at the same time. Western blot results indicated that apoptosis related protein Caspase3 and Caspase8 were differentially up-regulated in the CPF group. In summary, CPF exposure could induce apoptosis while inhibited autophagy in head kidney of common carp via the regulation of miR-2188-3p and miR-731 by targeting TLR pathway. These results provide new insights for unveiling the biological effects of CPF and miRNAs in common carp.

Anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) drugs are an important second-line treatment after methotrexate, the classic first-line treatment for RA. However, patient heterogeneity hinders identification of predictive biomarkers and accurate modeling of anti-TNF drug responses. This study was undertaken to investigate the usefulness of machine learning to assist in developing predictive models for treatment response. 
  Methods:  Using data on patient demographics, baseline disease assessment, treatment, and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array from the Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods (DREAM): Rheumatoid Arthritis Responder Challenge, we created a Gaussian process regression model to predict changes in the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) for the patients and to classify them into either the responder or the nonresponder group. This model was developed and cross-validated using data from 1,892 RA patients. It was evaluated using an independent data set from 680 patients. We examined the effectiveness of the similarity modeling and the contribution of individual features. 
  Results:  In the cross-validation tests, our method predicted changes in DAS28 (ΔDAS28), with a correlation coefficient of 0.405. It correctly classified responses from 78% of patients. In the independent test, this method achieved a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.393 in predicting ΔDAS28. Gaussian process regression effectively remapped the feature space and identified subpopulations that do not respond well to anti-TNF treatments. Genetic SNP biomarkers showed small contributions in the prediction when added to the clinical models. This was the best-performing model in the DREAM Challenge. 
  Conclusion:  The model described here shows promise in guiding treatment decisions in clinical practice, based primarily on clinical profiles with additional genetic information.

10.1016/j.gene.2019.144232  |  Genetics  ,    |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a global disease with high incidence and mortality rate. Hsp90 inhibitors induce cell death in various cancers, including CRC. However, the underlying mechanisms need to be clarified further. In this study, Caco-2 cells were treated with 0.25 μM SNX-2112, an Hsp90 inhibitor, for 48 h; subsequently, whole-transcriptome sequencing was performed. At the mRNA level in SNX-2112-treated Caco-2 cells, 1588 genes were upregulated, and 433 genes were downregulated. Six genes were found to be associated with necroptosis and apoptosis, and these 6 upregulated genes were validated by RT-qPCR. Hundred and six miRNAs were upregulated, and 48 miRNAs were downregulated in SNX-2112-treated Caco-2 cells. Eleven downregulated miRNAs were found to interact with the 6 upregulated genes. Moreover, 676 circRNAs were upregulated, and 291 circRNAs were downregulated in SNX-2112-treated Caco-2 cells. Among them, 126 circRNAs were found to be the target of the 11 downregulated miRNAs. The circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network of Hsp90 inhibitor-induced cell death in colorectal cancer was constructed. This regulatory network extends the underlying mechanism of Hsp90 and improves our understanding of Hsp90 inhibitors as potential targeted therapeutic agents.

10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2018.11.016  |  Genetics  ,  Prognosis  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The ever decreasing cost and increase in throughput of next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques have resulted in a rapid increase in availability of NGS data. Such data have the potential for rapid, reproducible and highly discriminative characterization of pathogens. This provides an opportunity in microbial risk assessment to account for variations in survivability and virulence among strains. A major challenge towards such attempts remains the highly dimensional nature of genomic data versus the number of isolates. Machine learning-based (ML) predictive risk modelling provides a solution to this "curse of dimensionality" while accounting for individual effects that are dependent on interactions with other genetic and environmental factors. This pilot study explores the potential of ML in the prediction of health endpoints resulting from shigatoxigenic E. coli (STEC) infection. Accessory genes in amino acid sequences were used as model input to predict and differentiate health outcomes in STEC infections including diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, hemolytic uremic syndrome and their combinations. Outcomes severity was also distinguished by hospitalization. A matrix of percent similarity between accessory genes and the E. coli genomes was generated and subsequently used as input for ML. The performances of ML algorithms random forest, support vector machine (radial and linear kernel), gradient boosting, and logit boost were compared. Logit boost was the best model showing an outcome prediction accuracy of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.60, 0.86), an excellent or substantial performance (Kappa = 0.72). Important genetic predictors of riskier STEC clinical outcomes included proteins involved in initial attachment to the host cell, persistence of plasmids or genomic islands, conjugative plasmid transfer and formation of sex pili, regulation of locus of enterocyte effacement expression, post-translational acetylation of proteins, facilitation of the rearrangement or deletion of sections within the pathogenic islands and transport macromolecules across the cell envelope. We propose further studies are proposed on the proteins with undefined or unclear functionality. One protein family in particular predicted HUS outcome. Toxin-antitoxin systems are potential stress adaptation markers which may mediate environmental persistence of strains in diverse sources. We foresee the application of ML approach to the set-up of real-time online analysis of whole genome sequence data to estimate the human health risk at the population or strain level. The ML approach is envisaged to support the prediction of more specific STEC clinical endpoints type by inputting isolate sequence data.

10.3390/ijms20215395  |  Treatment  ,  Drug Discovery  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   We developed a pipeline for the discovery of transcriptomics-derived disease-modifying therapies and used it to validate treatments in vitro and in vivo that could be repurposed for TBI treatment. Desmethylclomipramine, ionomycin, sirolimus and trimipramine, identified by in silico LINCS analysis as candidate treatments modulating the TBI-induced transcriptomics networks, were tested in neuron-BV2 microglial co-cultures, using tumour necrosis factor α as a monitoring biomarker for neuroinflammation, nitrite for nitric oxide-mediated neurotoxicity and microtubule associated protein 2-based immunostaining for neuronal survival. Based on (a) therapeutic time window in silico, (b) blood-brain barrier penetration and water solubility, (c) anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in vitro (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and (d) target engagement of Nrf2 target genes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), desmethylclomipramine was validated in a lateral fluid-percussion model of TBI in rats. Despite the favourable in silico and in vitro outcomes, in vivo assessment of clomipramine, which metabolizes to desmethylclomipramine, failed to demonstrate favourable effects on motor and memory tests. In fact, clomipramine treatment worsened the composite neuroscore (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Weight loss (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and prolonged upregulation of plasma cytokines (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) may have contributed to the worsened somatomotor outcome. Our pipeline provides a rational stepwise procedure for evaluating favourable and unfavourable effects of systems-biology discovered compounds that modulate post-TBI transcriptomics.

10.2196/12996  |  Smart Healthcare  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Individuals living with long-term physical health conditions frequently experience co-occurring mental health problems. This comorbidity has a significant impact on an individual's levels of emotional distress, health outcomes, and associated health care utilization. As health care services struggle to meet demand and care increasingly moves to the community, digital tools are being promoted to support patients to self-manage their health. One such technology is the autonomous virtual agent (chatbot, conversational agent), which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to process the user's written or spoken natural language and then to select or construct the corresponding appropriate responses. 
  Objective:  This study aimed to co-design the content, functionality, and interface modalities of an autonomous virtual agent to support self-management for patients with an exemplar long-term condition (LTC; chronic pulmonary obstructive disease [COPD]) and then to assess the acceptability and system content. 
  Methods:  We conducted 2 co-design workshops and a proof-of-concept implementation of an autonomous virtual agent with natural language processing capabilities. This implementation formed the basis for video-based scenario testing of acceptability with adults with a diagnosis of COPD and health professionals involved in their care. 
  Results:  Adults (n=6) with a diagnosis of COPD and health professionals (n=5) specified 4 priority self-management scenarios for which they would like to receive support: at the time of diagnosis (information provision), during acute exacerbations (crisis support), during periods of low mood (emotional support), and for general self-management (motivation). From the scenario testing, 12 additional adults with COPD felt the system to be both acceptable and engaging, particularly with regard to internet-of-things capabilities. They felt the system would be particularly useful for individuals living alone. 
  Conclusions:  Patients did not explicitly separate mental and physical health needs, although the content they developed for the virtual agent had a clear psychological approach. Supported self-management delivered via an autonomous virtual agent was acceptable to the participants. A co-design process has allowed the research team to identify key design principles, content, and functionality to underpin an autonomous agent for delivering self-management support to older adults living with COPD and potentially other LTCs.

10.1371/journal.pone.0226039  |  Other  ,  Genetics  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The fat body, a multifunctional organ analogous to the liver and fat tissue of vertebrates, plays an important role in insect life cycles. The fat body is involved in protein storage, energy metabolism, elimination of xenobiotics, and production of immunity regulator-like proteins. However, the molecular mechanism of the fat body's physiological functions in the tephritid stem gall-forming fly, Procecidochares utilis, are still unknown. In this study, we performed transcriptome analysis of the fat body of P. utilis using Illumina sequencing technology. In total, 3.71 G of clean reads were obtained and assembled into 30,559 unigenes, with an average length of 539 bp. Among those unigenes, 21,439 (70.16%) were annotated based on sequence similarity to proteins in NCBI's non-redundant protein sequence database (Nr). Sequences were also compared to NCBI's non-redundant nucleotide sequence database (Nt), a manually curated and reviewed protein sequence database (SwissProt), and KEGG and gene ontology annotations were applied to better understand the functions of these unigenes. A comparative analysis was performed to identify unigenes related to detoxification, immunity and energy metabolism. Many unigenes involved in detoxification were identified, including 50 unigenes of putative cytochrome P450s (P450s), 18 of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), 35 of carboxylesterases (CarEs) and 26 of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Many unigenes related to immunity were identified, including 17 putative serpin genes, five peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) and four lysozyme genes. In addition, unigenes potentially involved in energy metabolism, including 18 lipase genes, five fatty acid synthase (FAS) genes and six elongases of very long chain fatty acid (ELOVL) genes, were identified. This transcriptome improves our genetic understanding of P. utilis and the identification of a numerous transcripts in the fat body of P. utilis offer a series of valuable molecular resources for future studies on the functions of these genes.

10.3892/mmr.2018.9677  |  Prognosis  ,  Diagnosis  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The present study aimed to identify potential novel biomarkers in synovial tissue obtained from patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Osteoarthritis (OA) for differential diagnosis. The genome‑wide expression profiling datasets of synovial tissues from RA and OA cohorts, including GSE55235, GSE55457 and GSE55584 datasets, were retrieved and used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs; P&lt;0.05; false discovery rate &lt;0.05 and Fold Change &gt;2) between RA and OA using R software. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses of DEGs were performed to determine molecular and biochemical pathways associated with the identified DEGs, and a protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network of the DEGs was constructed using Cytoscape software. Significant modules in the PPI network and candidate driver genes were screened using the Molecular Complex Detection Algorithm. Potential biomarkers were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic and logistic regression analyses. Large numbers of DEGs were detected, including 273, 205 and 179 DEGs in the GSE55235, GSE55457 and GSE55584 datasets, respectively. Among them, 80 DEGs exhibited identical expression trends in all the three datasets, including 49 upregulated and 31 downregulated genes in patients with RA. DEGs in patients suffering from RA compared with patients suffering from OA were predominantly associated with the primary immunodeficiency pathway, including interleukin 7 receptor (IL7R) and signal transducer activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). The sensitivity of IL7R + STAT1 to differentiate RA from OA was 93.94% with a specificity of 80.77%. The results generated from analyses of the GSE36700 dataset were closely associated with results generated from analyses of GSE55235, GSE55457 and GSE55584 datasets, which further verified the reliability of the aforementioned results. The results of the present study suggested that increased expression of IL7R and STAT1 in synovial tissue as well as in the primary immunodeficiency may be associated with RA occurrence. These identified novel biomarkers may be used to predict disease occurrence and clinically differentiate RA from OA.

10.1242/jcs.221606  |  Genetics  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The junctional complexes that couple cardiomyocytes must transmit the mechanical forces of contraction while maintaining adhesive homeostasis. The adherens junction (AJ) connects the actomyosin networks of neighboring cardiomyocytes and is required for proper heart function. Yet little is known about the molecular composition of the cardiomyocyte AJ or how it is organized to function under mechanical load. Here, we define the architecture, dynamics and proteome of the cardiomyocyte AJ. Mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes assemble stable AJs along intercellular contacts with organizational and structural hallmarks similar to mature contacts. We combine quantitative mass spectrometry with proximity labeling to identify the N-cadherin (CDH2) interactome. We define over 350 proteins in this interactome, nearly 200 of which are unique to CDH2 and not part of the E-cadherin (CDH1) interactome. CDH2-specific interactors comprise primarily adaptor and adhesion proteins that promote junction specialization. Our results provide novel insight into the cardiomyocyte AJ and offer a proteomic atlas for defining the molecular complexes that regulate cardiomyocyte intercellular adhesion. This article has an associated First Person interview with the first authors of the paper.

10.1155/2019/9749751  |  Diagnosis  ,  Genetics  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Gastric cancer (GC) is a common tumor-associated lethal disease, and invasiveness and metastasis are primary challenges in its clinical treatment. Hypoxia microenvironment cannot be ignored in the process of metastasis. Hypoxia inducible factor-1<i>α</i> (HIF-1<i>α</i>) is the core component of the hypoxia signaling pathway. The aim of this study was to identify potential hub genes and signaling pathways associated with HIF-1<i>α</i>. We explored the invasiveness- and metastasis-associated phenotype of GC via bioinformatics analysis and molecular studies. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in GC cells and HIF-1<i>α</i>-knockdown GC cells. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. Hub genes were identified via centrality analysis and Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) module analysis. The findings suggested that prolyl 4-hydroxylase beta polypeptide (<i>P4HB</i>) has strong associations with HIF-1<i>α</i>. Further, we observed that HIF-1<i>α</i> and <i>P4HB</i> were upregulated in SGC-7901 and BGC-823 cells. In addition, inhibition of HIF-1<i>α</i> expression reduced invasion and metastasis in GC cells; this effect was partially reversed by <i>P4HB</i> overexpression. Our results confirm that <i>P4HB</i> plays a significant role in the regulatory network of HIF-1<i>α</i>. Therefore, HIF-1<i>α</i> and <i>P4HB</i> may be considered potential biomarkers of GC.

10.3390/ijms20030553  |  Diagnosis  ,  Genetics  ,  Treatment  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic airway inflammatory diseases that share some common features, although these diseases are somewhat different in etiologies, clinical features, and treatment policies. The aim of this study is to investigate the common microRNA-mediated changes in bronchial epithelial cells of asthma and COPD. The microRNA profiles in primary bronchial epithelial cells from asthma (AHBE) and COPD (CHBE) patients and healthy subjects (NHBE) were analyzed with next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the significant microRNA changes common in AHBE and CHBE were extracted. The upregulation of hsa-miR-10a-5p and hsa-miR-146a-5p in both AHBE and CHBE was confirmed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Using bioinformatic methods, we further identified putative targets of these microRNAs, which were downregulated in both AHBE and CHBE: miR-10a-5p might suppress <i>BCL2</i>, <i>FGFR3</i>, <i>FOXO3</i>, <i>PDE4A</i>, <i>PDE4C,</i> and <i>PDE7A</i>; miR-146a-5p might suppress <i>BCL2</i>, <i>INSR</i>, <i>PDE4D</i>, <i>PDE7A</i>, <i>PDE7B</i>, and <i>PDE11A</i>. We further validated significantly decreased expression levels of <i>FOXO3</i> and <i>PDE7A</i> in AHBE and CHBE than in NHBE with qPCR. Increased serum miR-146a-5p level was also noted in patients with asthma and COPD as compared with normal control subjects. In summary, our study revealed possible mechanisms mediated by miR-10a-5p and miR-146a-5p in the pathogenesis of both asthma and COPD. The findings might provide a scientific basis for developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

10.1371/journal.pone.0211908  |  None  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Three artificially selected duck populations (AS), higher lean meat ratios (LTPD), higher fat ratios (FTPD) and higher quality meat (CMD), have been developed in China, providing excellent populations for investigation of artificial selection effects. However, the genetic signatures of artificial selection are unclear. In this study, we sequenced the genome sequences of these three artificially selected populations and their ancestral population (mallard, M). We then compared the genome sequences between AS and M and between LTPD and FTPD using integrated strategies such as anchoring scaffolds to pseudo-chromosomes, mutation detection, selective screening, GO analysis, qRT-PCR, and protein multiple sequences alignment to uncover genetic signatures of selection. We anchored duck scaffolds to pseudo-chromosomes and obtained 28 pseudo-chromosomes, accounting for 84% of duck genome in length. Totally 78 and 99 genes were found to be under selection between AS and M and between LTPD and FTPD. Genes under selection between AS and M mainly involved in pigmentation and heart rates, while genes under selection between LTPD and FTPD involved in muscle development and fat deposition. A heart rate regulator (HCN1), the strongest selected gene between AS and M, harbored a GC deletion in AS and displayed higher mRNA expression level in M than in AS. IGF2R, a regulator of skeletal muscle mass, was found to be under selection between FTPD and LTPD. We also found two nonsynonymous substitutions in IGF2R, which might lead to higher IGF2R mRNA expression level in FTPD than LTPD, indicating the two nonsynonymous substitutions might play a key role for the regulation of duck skeletal muscle mass. Taken together, these results of this study provide valuable insight for the genetic basis of duck artificial selection.

Plasmodium spp. parasites that cause malaria contain an essential, non-photosynthetic plastid-the apicoplast-which originated from a secondary (eukaryote-eukaryote) endosymbiosis. To discover organellar pathways with evolutionary and biomedical significance, we performed a mutagenesis screen for essential genes required for apicoplast biogenesis in Plasmodium falciparum. Apicoplast(-) mutants were isolated using a chemical rescue that permits conditional disruption of the apicoplast and a new fluorescent reporter for organelle loss. Five candidate genes were validated (out of 12 identified), including a triosephosphate isomerase (TIM)-barrel protein that likely derived from a core metabolic enzyme but evolved a new activity. Our results demonstrate, to our knowledge, the first forward genetic screen to assign essential cellular functions to unannotated P. falciparum genes. A putative TIM-barrel enzyme and other newly identified apicoplast biogenesis proteins open opportunities to discover new mechanisms of organelle biogenesis, molecular evolution underlying eukaryotic diversity, and drug targets against multiple parasitic diseases.

10.3892/ijmm.2019.4108  |  Prognosis  ,  Genetics  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The aim of the present study was to identify the important mRNAs, micro (mi)RNAs and long non‑coding (lnc)RNAs that are associated with osteosarcoma recurrence. The GSE3905 dataset, which contains two sub‑datasets (GSE39040 and GSE39055), was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Prognosis‑associated RNAs were identified by performing Cox regression univariate analysis and were subsequently used to construct a competing endogenous (ce)RNA regulatory network for Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Kaplan‑Meier survival analysis was used to determine the associations between expression levels and survival prognosis. In addition, another independent miRNA profile, GSE79181, was downloaded from GEO for validation. Among the differentially expressed RNAs, 417 RNAs (5 lncRNAs, 19 miRNAs, and 393 mRNAs) were observed to be associated with prognosis. The GSEA for the ceRNA regulatory network revealed that 'Mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway', 'Chemokine signaling pathway' and 'Spliceosome' were markedly associated with osteosarcoma. In addition, three lncRNAs [long intergenic non‑protein coding RNA 28 (LINC00028), LINC00323, and small nucleolar RNA host gene 1 (SNHG1)] and two miRNAs (hsa‑miR‑124 and hsa‑miR‑7) regulating three mRNAs [Ras‑related protein Rap‑1b (RAP1B), activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) and protein phosphatase Mg2+/Mn2+ dependent 1B (PPM1B)] participated in the MAPK signaling pathway. The Kaplan‑Meier survival analysis also demonstrated that samples with lower expression levels of LINC00323 and SNHG1 had better prognosis, and samples with increased expression levels of LINC00028, hsa‑miR‑124 and hsa‑miR‑7 had better prognosis. Overexpression of RAP1B, ATF2 and PPM1B was positively associated with osteosarcoma recurrence. The roles of hsa‑miR‑124 and hsa‑miR‑7 in osteosarcoma recurrence were also validated using GSE79181. Thus, in conclusions, the three lncRNAs (LINC00028, LINC00323 and SNHG1), two miRNAs (hsa‑miR‑124 and hsa‑miR‑7) and three mRNAs (RAP1B, ATF2, and PPM1B) were associated with osteosarcoma recurrence.

10.1186/s12885-019-5433-7  |  Prognosis  ,  Genetics  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common type of lung cancers. Whole-genome sequencing studies disclosed the genomic landscape of lung adenocarcinomas. however, it remains unclear if the genetic alternations could guide prognosis prediction. Effective genetic markers and their based prediction models are also at a lack for prognosis evaluation. 
  Methods:  We obtained the somatic mutation data and clinical data for 371 lung adenocarcinoma cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The cases were classified into two prognostic groups (3-year survival), and a comparison was performed between the groups for the somatic mutation frequencies of genes, followed by development of computational models to discrete the different prognosis. 
  Results:  Genes were found with higher mutation rates in good (≥ 3-year survival) than in poor (&lt; 3-year survival) prognosis group of lung adenocarcinoma patients. Genes participating in cell-cell adhesion and motility were significantly enriched in the top gene list with mutation rate difference between the good and poor prognosis group. Support Vector Machine models with the gene somatic mutation features could well predict prognosis, and the performance improved as feature size increased. An 85-gene model reached an average cross-validated accuracy of 81% and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.896 for the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. The model also exhibited good inter-stage prognosis prediction performance, with an average AUC of 0.846 for the ROC curves. 
  Conclusion:  The prognosis of lung adenocarcinomas is related with somatic gene mutations. The genetic markers could be used for prognosis prediction and furthermore provide guidance for personal medicine.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the MEC remain poorly understand. Here, we simultaneously detected, for the first time, the expression profiles of mRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs in four pairs of MEC and matched non-carcinoma tissues by microarrays. A total of 3612 mRNA, 3091 lncRNAs, and 284 circRNAs were altered during the pathogenesis of MEC. The functions of these differentially expressed RNAs were predicted by Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. Co-expression networks of lncRNA-mRNA and circRNA-miRNA were conducted to uncovered the hidden ceRNA mechanisms. Moreover, NONHSAT154433.1 that associated with ADAM12 and hsa_circ_0012342 were further screened and confirmed using qRT-PCR analysis. In conclusion, this study provides a systematic perspective on the potential function of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in the molecular mechanisms of MEC. Among these, NONHSAT154433.1 and hsa_circ_0012342 might be served as potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic target of MEC.

These intrinsic differences are closely related to clinical diagnosis and designation of treatment plans. With the accumulation of biological and medicine datasets, there are many different omics data that can be viewed in different aspects. Combining these multiple omics data can improve the accuracy of prediction. Meanwhile; there are also many different databases available for us to download different types of omics data. In this article, we use estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) to define breast cancer subtypes and classify any two breast cancer subtypes using SMO-MKL algorithm. We collected mRNA data, methylation data and copy number variation (CNV) data from TCGA to classify breast cancer subtypes. Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) is employed to use these omics data distinctly. The result of using three omics data with multiple kernels is better than that of using single omics data with multiple kernels. Furthermore; these significant genes and pathways discovered in the feature selection process are also analyzed. In experiments; the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and has abundant biological interpretations.

They are often silenced in differentiated somatic cells but differentially expressed at various embryonic developmental stages. A minority of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), like 2-cell cleavage embryos, highly express ERV MERVL. However, the role of ERVs and mechanism of their activation in these cells are still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the regulation and function of the stage-specific expressed ERVs, with a particular focus on the totipotency marker MT2/MERVL. We show that the transcription factor Zscan4c functions as an activator of MT2/MERVL and 2-cell/4-cell embryo genes. Zinc finger domains of Zscan4c play an important role in this process. In addition, Zscan4c interacts with MT2 and regulates MT2-nearby 2-cell/4-cell genes through promoting enhancer activity of MT2. Furthermore, MT2 activation is accompanied by enhanced H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and H3K14ac deposition on MT2. Zscan4c also interacts with GBAF chromatin remodelling complex through SCAN domain to further activate MT2 enhancer activity. Taken together, we delineate a previously unrecognized regulatory axis that Zscan4c interacts with and activates MT2/MERVL loci and their nearby genes through epigenetic regulation.

10.3892/mmr.2019.10213  |  Prognosis  , Genetics  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The poor outcome of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) highlights the importance of the identification of novel effective prognostic biomarkers. Long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) serve regulatory roles in various types of cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate the lncRNA expression profile in ESCC and to identify lncRNAs associated with the prognosis of ESCC by performing comprehensive bioinformatics analyses. The RNA‑sequencing (Seq) expression dataset GSE53625 generated from ESCC samples was used as a training dataset. Additional RNA‑Seq datasets relative to ESCC samples were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas and used as a validation dataset. Data were screened using the limma package, and differentially expressed lncRNAs between early‑ and late‑stage ESCC were identified. A random forest algorithm was used to select the optimal lncRNA biomarkers, which were then analyzed using the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm with R software. The identified lncRNA biomarkers were examined in the validation dataset by bidirectional hierarchical clustering and using an SVM classifier. Subsequently, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to analyze the potential ability lncRNAs to predict the survival rate of patients with ESCC. By examining the training group, 259 deregulated lncRNAs between early‑ and advanced‑stage ESCC were identified. Further bioinformatics analyses identified a nine‑lncRNA signature, including AC098973, AL133493, RP11‑51M24, RP11‑317N8, RP11‑834C11, RP11‑69C17, LINC00471, LINC01193 and RP1‑124C. This nine‑lncRNA signature was used to predict the tumor stage and patient survival rate with high reliability and accuracy in the training and validation datasets. Furthermore, these nine lncRNA biomarkers were primarily involved in regulating the cell cycle and DNA replication, and these processes were previously identified to be associated with the progression of ESCC. The identified nine‑lncRNA signature was identified to be associated with the tumor stage, and could be used as predictor of the survival rate of patients with ESCC.

The median overall survival time (OS) was 41.1 months. Cox multivariate analysis showed that smoking history, tumor stage, and surgical margin resection status were independently associated with PFS, and tumor stage and surgical margin resection status were independently associated with OS. The accuracy of the established ANN model itself was predicted to be 65.8%. The accuracy of correctly predicting the prognosis of the predicted samples was 75.0%, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.712.The clinical prognostic factors of lung adenocarcinoma include: smoking history, tumor stage, and surgical margin resection status. The established ANN model can be used to predict the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma.

10.1093/eurheartj/ehz056  |  Other  |  SubfieldA  |  Review  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Deep learning (DL) is a branch of machine learning (ML) showing increasing promise in medicine, to assist in data classification, novel disease phenotyping and complex decision making. Deep learning is a form of ML typically implemented via multi-layered neural networks. Deep learning has accelerated by recent advances in computer hardware and algorithms and is increasingly applied in e-commerce, finance, and voice and image recognition to learn and classify complex datasets. The current medical literature shows both strengths and limitations of DL. Strengths of DL include its ability to automate medical image interpretation, enhance clinical decision-making, identify novel phenotypes, and select better treatment pathways in complex diseases. Deep learning may be well-suited to cardiovascular medicine in which haemodynamic and electrophysiological indices are increasingly captured on a continuous basis by wearable devices as well as image segmentation in cardiac imaging. However, DL also has significant weaknesses including difficulties in interpreting its models (the 'black-box' criticism), its need for extensive adjudicated ('labelled') data in training, lack of standardization in design, lack of data-efficiency in training, limited applicability to clinical trials, and other factors. Thus, the optimal clinical application of DL requires careful formulation of solvable problems, selection of most appropriate DL algorithms and data, and balanced interpretation of results. This review synthesizes the current state of DL for cardiovascular clinicians and investigators, and provides technical context to appreciate the promise, pitfalls, near-term challenges, and opportunities for this exciting new area.

10.1016/j.acra.2019.02.024  |  Diagnosis  ,  Treatment  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Objectives:  To develop a deep learning-based algorithm to automatically identify optimal portal venous phase timing (PVP-timing) so that image analysis techniques can be accurately performed on post contrast studies. 
  Methods:  681 CT-scans (training: 479 CT-scans; validation: 202 CT-scans) from a multicenter clinical trial in patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer were retrospectively analyzed for algorithm development and validation. An additional external validation was performed on a cohort of 228 CT-scans from gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine cancer patients. Image acquisition was performed according to each centers' standard CT protocol for single portal venous phase, portal venous acquisition. The reference gold standard for the classification of PVP-timing as either optimal or nonoptimal was based on experienced radiologists' consensus opinion. The algorithm performed automated localization (on axial slices) of the portal vein and aorta upon which a novel dual input Convolutional Neural Network calculated a probability of the optimal PVP-timing. 
  Results:  The algorithm automatically computed a PVP-timing score in 3 seconds and reached area under the curve of 0.837 (95% CI: 0.765, 0.890) in validation set and 0.844 (95% CI: 0.786, 0.889) in external validation set. 
  Conclusion:  A fully automated, deep-learning derived PVP-timing algorithm was developed to classify scans' contrast-enhancement timing and identify scans with optimal PVP-timing. The rapid identification of such scans will aid in the analysis of quantitative (radiomics) features used to characterize tumors and changes in enhancement with treatment in a multitude of settings including quantitative response criteria such as Choi and MASS which rely on reproducible measurement of enhancement.

10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2019.07.017  |  Smart healthcare  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Objective:  To assess the role of speech recognition (SR) technology in clinicians' documentation workflows by examining use of, experience with and opinions about this technology. 
  Materials and methods:  We distributed a survey in 2016-2017 to 1731 clinician SR users at two large medical centers in Boston, Massachusetts and Aurora, Colorado. The survey asked about demographic and clinical characteristics, SR use and preferences, perceived accuracy, efficiency, and usability of SR, and overall satisfaction. Associations between outcomes (e.g., satisfaction) and factors (e.g., error prevalence) were measured using ordinal logistic regression. 
  Results:  Most respondents (65.3%) had used their SR system for under one year. 75.5% of respondents estimated seeing 10 or fewer errors per dictation, but 19.6% estimated half or more of errors were clinically significant. Although 29.4% of respondents did not include SR among their preferred documentation methods, 78.8% were satisfied with SR, and 77.2% agreed that SR improves efficiency. Satisfaction was associated positively with efficiency and negatively with error prevalence and editing time. Respondents were interested in further training about using SR effectively but expressed concerns regarding software reliability, editing and workflow. 
  Discussion:  Compared to other documentation methods (e.g., scribes, templates, typing, traditional dictation), SR has emerged as an effective solution, overcoming limitations inherent in other options and potentially improving efficiency while preserving documentation quality. 
  Conclusion:  While concerns about SR usability and accuracy persist, clinicians expressed positive opinions about its impact on workflow and efficiency. Faster and better approaches are needed for clinical documentation, and SR is likely to play an important role going forward.

10.1007/s00330-019-06447-7  |  Other  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Objective:  To classify motion-induced blurred images of calcified coronary plaques so as to correct coronary calcium scores on nontriggered chest CT, using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained by images of motion artifacts. 
  Methods:  Three artificial coronary arteries containing nine calcified plaques of different densities (high, medium, and low) and sizes (large, medium, and small) were attached to a moving robotic arm. The artificial arteries moving at 0-90 mm/s were scanned to generate nine categories (each from one calcified plaque) of images with motion artifacts. An inception v3 CNN was fine-tuned and validated. Agatston scores of the predicted classification by CNN were considered as corrected scores. Variation of Agatston scores on moving plaque and by CNN correction was calculated using the scores at rest as reference. 
  Results:  The overall accuracy of CNN classification was 79.2 ± 6.1% for nine categories. The accuracy was 88.3 ± 4.9%, 75.9 ± 6.4%, and 73.5 ± 5.0% for the high-, medium-, and low-density plaques, respectively. Compared with the Agatston score at rest, the overall median score variation was 37.8% (1st and 3rd quartile, 10.5% and 68.8%) in moving plaques. CNN correction largely decreased the variation to 3.7% (1.9%, 9.1%) (p &lt; 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test) and improved the sensitivity (percentage of non-zero scores among all the scores) from 65 to 85% for detection of coronary calcifications. 
  Conclusions:  In this experimental study, CNN showed the ability to classify motion-induced blurred images and correct calcium scores derived from nontriggered chest CT. CNN correction largely reduces the overall Agatston score variation and increases the sensitivity to detect calcifications. 
  Key points:  • A deep CNN architecture trained by CT images of motion artifacts showed the ability to correct coronary calcium scores from blurred images. • A correction algorithm based on deep CNN can be used for a tenfold reduction in Agatston score variations from 38 to 3.7% of moving coronary calcified plaques and to improve the sensitivity from 65 to 85% for the detection of calcifications. • This experimental study provides a method to improve its accuracy for coronary calcium scores that is a fundamental step towards a real clinical scenario.

10.1016/j.celrep.2019.11.083  |  Genetics  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   In vitro gametogenesis is the process of making germline cells from human pluripotent stem cells. The foundation of this model is the quality of the first progenitors called primordial germ cells (PGCs), which in vivo are specified during the peri-implantation window of human development. Here, we show that human PGC (hPGC) specification begins at day 12 post-fertilization. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of hPGC-like cells (hPGCLCs) differentiated from pluripotent stem cells, we discovered that hPGCLC specification involves resetting pluripotency toward a transitional state with shared characteristics between naive and primed pluripotency, followed by differentiation into lineage-primed TFAP2A<sup>+</sup> progenitors. Applying the germline trajectory to TFAP2C mutants reveals that TFAP2C functions in the TFAP2A<sup>+</sup> progenitors upstream of PRDM1 to regulate the expression of SOX17. This serves to protect hPGCLCs from crossing the Weismann's barrier to adopt somatic cell fates and, therefore, is an essential mechanism for successfully initiating in vitro gametogenesis.

10.1097/BRS.0000000000002974  |  Treatment  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Study design:  Retrospective review of prospectively-collected, multicenter adult spinal deformity (ASD) databases. 
  Objective:  To apply artificial intelligence (AI)-based hierarchical clustering as a step toward a classification scheme that optimizes overall quality, value, and safety for ASD surgery. 
  Summary of background data:  Prior ASD classifications have focused on radiographic parameters associated with patient reported outcomes. Recent work suggests there are many other impactful preoperative data points. However, the ability to segregate patient patterns manually based on hundreds of data points is beyond practical application for surgeons. Unsupervised machine-based clustering of patient types alongside surgical options may simplify analysis of ASD patient types, procedures and outcomes. 
  Methods:  Two prospective cohorts were queried for surgical ASD patients with baseline, 1-year, and 2-year SRS-22/ODI/SF-36v2 data. Two dendrograms were fitted, one with surgical features and one with patient characteristics. Both were built with Ward distances and optimized with the gap method. For each possible n patient cluster by m surgery, normalized 2-year improvement and major complication rates were computed. 
  Results:  570 patients were included. Three optimal patient types were identified: young with coronal plane deformity (YC, n = 195), older with prior spine surgeries (ORev, n = 157), and older without prior spine surgeries (OPrim, n = 218). Osteotomy type, instrumentation and interbody fusion were combined to define 4 surgical clusters. The intersection of patient-based and surgery-based clusters yielded 12 subgroups, with major complication rates ranging from 0% to 51.8% and 2-year normalized improvement ranging from -0.1% for SF36v2 MCS in cluster [1,3] to 100.2% for SRS self-image score in cluster [2,1]). 
  Conclusions:  Unsupervised hierarchical clustering can identify data patterns that may augment preoperative decision making through construction of a 2-year risk-benefit grid. In addition to creating a novel AI-based ASD classification, pattern identification may facilitate treatment optimization by educating surgeons on which treatment patterns yield optimal improvement with lowest risk.

10.1007/s11548-019-01931-3  |  Treatment  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Purpose:  For the parallel external fixator, there are some defects, such as uneven distraction rate, unbearable pain and uncontrollable movement trajectory in practical clinical applications. In order to solve the problems, a new deformity correction algorithm, which is used to calculate the elongation of the six struts, is developed. Meanwhile, the corresponding computer software for getting the electronic prescription is developed. 
  Methods:  First, the trajectory of the moving bone is planned by Cartesian coordinate path control. Next, the prescription is obtained from the trajectory by the inverse pose solution algorithm. Finally, the genetic algorithm is utilized to optimize the achieved prescription. From the year of 2015 to 2018, twenty-three patients with complicated tibia deformity are treated by using parallel external fixator and the developed computer software. All patients have standing, patella-forward, full-length post-operative AP and lateral radiographs of the lower limbs with the complete proximal ring for getting the deformity parameters and frame parameters. These parameters are input into the computer software to calculate a daily prescription schedule for strut adjustment. Radiographs are taken regularly to determine the effects of recovery during the correction process. 
  Results:  The mean time of follow-up is 18 months (range 11-40 months). All patients reach the requirements for deformity correction, and their symptoms and appearance are improved significantly. No cases of wound infections or complications occur, and no severe pain came as well during the correction process. 
  Conclusions:  By using the computer-aided parallel external fixator for the correction of lower limb deformities, satisfactory outcomes can be achieved. Hence, this method greatly improved the treatment of these patients in a clinical application.

10.1063/1.5120605  |  None  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Understanding 3D scene geometry is a fundamental research topic in computer vision, including various subproblems, such as depth prediction, visual odometry, optical flow, etc. With the advent of artificial intelligence methods like deep learning, many approaches have emerged to deal with such problems in an end-to-end manner. These pipelines take the 3D understanding task as a nonlinear optimization problem, with the purpose of minimizing the cost function of the whole framework. Here, we present a self-supervised framework for jointly learning the monocular depth and camera's ego-motion from unlabeled, unstructured, and monocular video sequences. We propose a forward-backward consistency constraint on view reconstruction to capture temporal relations across adjacent frames, whose purpose is to explore and make full use of the bidirectional projection information. A simple and practicable improvement on the design of cost function is proposed to enhance the estimated accuracy. Due to the fact that our improvement is a lightweight and general module, it can be integrated into any self-supervised architectures seamlessly, and more accurate results can be obtained. The evaluation on the KITTI dataset demonstrates that our approach is highly efficient and performs better than the existing works in pose estimation, while the results in depth estimation perform comparably with the existing ones.

10.1016/j.immuni.2019.03.001  |  Other  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Skin conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) exist as two distinct subsets, cDC1s and cDC2s, which maintain the balance of immunity to pathogens and tolerance to self and microbiota. Here, we examined the roles of dermal cDC1s and cDC2s during bacterial infection, notably Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes). cDC1s, but not cDC2s, regulated the magnitude of the immune response to P. acnes in the murine dermis by controlling neutrophil recruitment to the inflamed site and survival and function therein. Single-cell mRNA sequencing revealed that this regulation relied on secretion of the cytokine vascular endothelial growth factor α (VEGF-α) by a minor subset of activated EpCAM<sup>+</sup>CD59<sup>+</sup>Ly-6D<sup>+</sup> cDC1s. Neutrophil recruitment by dermal cDC1s was also observed during S. aureus, bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), or E. coli infection, as well as in a model of bacterial insult in human skin. Thus, skin cDC1s are essential regulators of the innate response in cutaneous immunity and have roles beyond classical antigen presentation.

10.3390/s20010186  |  None  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Siphons have been widely used in water supply systems and sewage networks. However, it is difficult to implement non-destructive testing due to structural complexity and limited accessibility. In this paper, a novel condition classification method for water-filled underground siphons is proposed, which uses the acoustic signals received from acoustic sensors installed in the siphon. The proposed method has the advantages of simpler operation, lower cost, and higher detection efficiency. The acoustic wave forms in the siphons reflect on the system characteristics. Seven typical conditions of a water-filled underground siphon were investigated, and a series of experiments were conducted. Acoustic signals were recorded and transformed into acoustic pressure responses for further analysis. The variational mode decomposition (VMD) and the acoustic energy flow density were used for signal processing and feature extraction. The acoustic energy flux density eigenvectors were input to three different classifiers to classify the siphon conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed acoustic-based approach can effectively classify the blockage and damage conditions of siphons, and the recognition accuracy of the proposed method is higher than 94.4%. Therefore, this research has value for engineering applications.

10.1097/PRS.0000000000005865  |  Other  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Tools to quantify layperson assessments of facial palsy are lacking. In this study, artificial intelligence was applied to develop a proxy for layperson assessments, and compare sensitivity to existing outcome measures. 
  Methods:  Artificially intelligent emotion detection software was used to develop the emotionality quotient. The emotionality quotient was defined as the percentage probability of perceived joy over the percentage probability of perceived negative emotions during smiling, as predicted by the software. The emotionality quotient was used to analyze the emotionality of voluntary smiles of normal subjects and unilateral facial palsy patients before and after smile reanimation. The emotionality quotient was compared to oral commissure excursion and layperson assessments of facial palsy patients. 
  Results:  In voluntary smiles of 10 normal subjects, 100 percent joy and no negative emotion was detected (interquartile ranges, 0/1). Median preoperative emotionality quotient of 30 facial palsy patients was 15/-60 (interquartile range, 73/62). Postoperatively, median emotionality quotient was 84/0 (interquartile range, 28/5). In 134 smile reanimation patients, no correlation was found between postoperative oral commissure excursion and emotionality quotient score. However, in 61 preoperative patients, a moderate correlation was found between layperson-assessed disfigurement and negative emotion perception (correlation coefficient, 0.516; p &lt; 0.001). 
  Conclusions:  Computer vision artificial intelligence software detected less joy and more negative emotion in smiles of facial palsy patients compared with normal subjects. Following smile reanimation, significantly more joy and less negative emotion were detected. The emotionality quotient was correlated with layperson assessments. The simplicity, sensitivity, and objectivity of the emotionality quotient render it an attractive tool to serve as a potential proxy for layperson assessment, an ideal outcome measure in facial palsy.

10.1136/gutjnl-2019-319292  |  Prognosis  ,  Diagnosis  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Objective:  Diagnostic tests, such as Immunoscore, predict prognosis in patients with colon cancer. However, additional prognostic markers could be detected on pathological slides using artificial intelligence tools. 
  Design:  We have developed a software to detect colon tumour, healthy mucosa, stroma and immune cells on CD3 and CD8 stained slides. The lymphocyte density and surface area were quantified automatically in the tumour core (TC) and invasive margin (IM). Using a LASSO algorithm, DGMate (DiGital tuMor pArameTErs), we detected digital parameters within the tumour cells related to patient outcomes. 
  Results:  Within the dataset of 1018 patients, we observed that a poorer relapse-free survival (RFS) was associated with high IM stromal area (HR 5.65; 95% CI 2.34 to 13.67; p&lt;0.0001) and high DGMate (HR 2.72; 95% CI 1.92 to 3.85; p&lt;0.001). Higher CD3+ TC, CD3+ IM and CD8+ TC densities were significantly associated with a longer RFS. Analysis of variance showed that CD3+ TC yielded a similar prognostic value to the classical CD3/CD8 Immunoscore (p=0.44). A combination of the IM stromal area, DGMate and CD3, designated 'DGMuneS', outperformed Immunoscore when used in estimating patients' prognosis (C-index=0.601 vs 0.578, p=0.04) and was independently associated with patient outcomes following Cox multivariate analysis. A predictive nomogram based on DGMuneS and clinical variables identified a group of patients with less than 10% relapse risk and another group with a 50% relapse risk. 
  Conclusion:  These findings suggest that artificial intelligence can potentially improve patient care by assisting pathologists in better defining stage III colon cancer patients' prognosis.

10.1016/j.diii.2019.02.010  |  Prognosis  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Purpose:  The purpose of this study was to identify magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features that are associated with telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter mutation (TERTm) in glioblastoma. 
  Materials and methods:  A total of 112 patients with glioblastoma who had MRI at 1.5- or 3.0-T were retrospectively included. There were 43 patients with glioblastoma with wild-type TERT (TERTw) (22 men, 21 women; mean age, 47±25 [SD] years; age range: 3-84 years) and 69 patients with glioblastoma with TERTm (34 men, 35 women; mean age 64±11 [SD] years; age range, 41--85 years). The feature vectors consist of 11 input units for two clinical parameters (age and gender) and nine MRI characteristics (tumor location, subventricular extension, cortical extension, multiplicity, enhancing volume, necrosis volume, the percentage of necrosis volume, minimum apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC] and normalized ADC). First, the diagnostic performance using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses was evaluated. Second, the cross-validation of the support vector machine (SVM) was performed by using leave-one-out method with 43 TERTw and 69 TERTm to evaluate the diagnostic performance. In addition, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy for the differentiation between TERTw and TERTm were compared between logistic regression analysis and SVM. 
  Results:  With multivariate analysis, the percentage of necrosis volume and age were significantly greater in TERTm glioblastoma than in TERTw glioblastoma. SVM allowed discriminating between TERTw glioblastoma and TERTm glioblastoma with sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of 85.7% [60/70; 95% confidence interval (CI): 75.3-92.9%], 54.8% (23/42; 95% CI: 38.7-70.2%), 75.9% (60/79; 95% CI: 69.1-81.7%), 69.7% (23/33; 95% CI: 54.9-81.3%) and 74.1% (83/112; 95% CI: 65.0-81.9%), respectively. 
  Conclusion:  The percentage of necrosis volume and age may surrogate for predicting TERT mutation status in glioblastoma.

10.3390/cells8030235  |  Genetics  ,  Prognosis  ,  Treatment  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The efficiency of cisplatin (CDDP) is significantly hindered by the development of resistance during the treatment course. To gain a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of cisplatin resistance, we comparatively analyzed established a CDDP-resistant neuroblastoma cell line (UKF-NB-4<sup>CDDP</sup>) and its susceptible parental cells (UKF-NB-4). We verified increased chemoresistance of UKF-NB-4<sup>CDDP</sup> cells by analyzing the viability, induction of apoptosis and clonal efficiency. To shed more light on this phenomenon, we employed custom cDNA microarray (containing 2234 probes) to perform parallel transcriptomic profiling of RNA and identified that 139 genes were significantly up-regulated due to CDDP chemoresistance. The analyses of molecular pathways indicated that the top up-regulation scoring functions were response to stress, abiotic stimulus, regulation of metabolic process, apoptotic processes, regulation of cell proliferation, DNA repair or regulation of catalytic activity, which was also evidenced by analysis of molecular functions revealing up-regulation of genes encoding several proteins with a wide-spectrum of enzymatic activities. Functional analysis using lysosomotropic agents chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 validated their potential to re-sensitize UKF-NB-4<sup>CDDP</sup> cells to CDDP. Taken together, the identification of alterations in specific genes and pathways that contribute to CDDP chemoresistance may potentially lead to a renewed interest in the development of novel rational therapeutics and prognostic biomarkers for the management of CDDP-resistant neuroblastoma.

10.1371/journal.pone.0217593  |  Other  ,  Genetics  ,  Treatment  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Pueraria thomsonii Benth is an important medicinal plant. Transcriptome sequencing, unigene assembly, the annotation of transcripts and the study of gene expression profiles play vital roles in gene function research. However, the full-length transcriptome of P. thomsonii remains unknown. Here, we obtained 44,339 nonredundant transcripts of P. thomsonii by using the PacBio RS II Isoform and Illumina sequencing platforms, of which 43,195 were annotated genes. Compared with the expression levels in the plant roots, those of transcripts with a |fold change| ≥ 4 and FDR &lt; 0.01 in the leaves or stems were assigned as differentially expressed transcripts (DETs). In total, we found 9,225 DETs, 32 of which came from structural genes that were potentially involved in isoflavone biosynthesis. The expression profiles of 8 structural genes from the RNA-Seq data were validated by qRT-PCR. We identified 437 transcription factors (TFs) that were positively or negatively correlated with at least 1 of the structural genes involved in isoflavone biosynthesis using Pearson correlation coefficients (r) (r &gt; 0.8 or r &lt; -0.8). We also identified a total of 32 microRNAs (miRNAs), which targeted 805 transcripts. These miRNAs caused enriched function in 'ATP binding', 'defense response', 'ADP binding', and 'signal transduction'. Interestingly, MIR156a potentially promoted isoflavone biosynthesis by repressing SBP, and MIR319 promoted isoflavone biosynthesis by repressing TCP and HB-HD-ZIP. Finally, we identified 2,690 alternative splicing events, including that of the structural genes of trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase and pullulanase, which are potentially involved in the biosynthesis of isoflavone and starch, respectively, and of three TFs potentially involved in isoflavone biosynthesis. Together, these results provide us with comprehensive insight into the gene expression and regulation of P. thomsonii.

10.1097/JU.0000000000000416  |  Other  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Purpose:  There is a differential in prostate cancer mortality between black and white men. Advances in precision medicine have shifted the research focus toward underlying genetic differences. However, nonbiological factors may have a large role in these observed disparities. Therefore, we sought to measure the relative importance of race compared to health care and social factors on prostate cancer specific mortality. 
  Materials and methods:  Using the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) database we identified 514,878 men diagnosed with prostate cancer at age 40 years or greater between 2004 and 2012. We also selected a subset of black and white men matched by age, stage and birth year. We stratified patients by age 40 to 54, 55 to 69 and 70 years or older and disease stage, resulting in 18 groups. By applying random forest methods with variable importance measures we analyzed 15 variables and interactions across 4 categories of factors (tumor characteristics, race, and health care and social factors) and the relative importance for prostate cancer specific mortality. 
  Results:  Tumor characteristics at diagnosis were the most important factors for prostate cancer mortality. Across all groups race was less than 5% as important as tumor characteristics and only more important than health care and social factors in 2 of the 18 groups. Although race had a significant impact, health care and social factors known to be associated with racial disparities had greater or similarly important effects across all ages and stages. 
  Conclusions:  Eradicating disparities in prostate cancer survival will require a multipronged approach, including advances in precision medicine. Disparities will persist unless health care access and social equality are achieved among all populations.

10.3802/jgo.2019.30.e65  |  Prognosis  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Objectives:  The aim of this study was to develop a new prognostic classification for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients using gradient boosting (GB) and to compare the accuracy of the prognostic model with the conventional statistical method. 
  Methods:  Information of EOC patients from Samsung Medical Center (training cohort, n=1,128) was analyzed to optimize the prognostic model using GB. The performance of the final model was externally validated with patient information from Asan Medical Center (validation cohort, n=229). The area under the curve (AUC) by the GB model was compared to that of the conventional Cox proportional hazard regression analysis (CoxPHR) model. 
  Results:  In the training cohort, the AUC of the GB model for predicting second year overall survival (OS), with the highest target value, was 0.830 (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.802-0.853). In the validation cohort, the GB model also showed high AUC of 0.843 (95% CI=0.833-0.853). In comparison, the conventional CoxPHR method showed lower AUC (0.668 (95% CI=0.617-0.719) for the training cohort and 0.597 (95% CI=0.474-0.719) for the validation cohort) compared to GB. New classification according to survival probability scores of the GB model identified four distinct prognostic subgroups that showed more discriminately classified prediction than the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging system. 
  Conclusion:  Our novel GB-guided classification accurately identified the prognostic subgroups of patients with EOC and showed higher accuracy than the conventional method. This approach would be useful for accurate estimation of individual outcomes of EOC patients.

10.1016/j.biopha.2019.109535  |  Genetics  ,  Treatment  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   With increasing demand, the development of new natural antioxidants has become a primary direction of scientific research. We previously identified a short gene-encoded peptide (OA-VI12) from Odorrana andersonii frog skin secretions that exerted direct scavenging capacity against free radicals, suggesting a possible function in protecting skin against photodamage caused by their high-altitude habitat. In the current research, we examined the effects of OA-VI12 on both UVB-irradiation and hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress models established with human immortalized keratinocytes. In addition, we identified the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the oxidative stress and OA-VI12 groups and further performed transcriptome as well as functional and pathway enrichment analyses. Results showed that OA-VI12 protected cell viability, promoted the release of catalase, and decreased the levels of lactate dehydrogenase and reactive oxygen species. Moreover, the peptide promoted the production of superoxide dismutase and glutathione, alleviated epidermis and dermis thickness, and decreased the production of light spots and collagen fibers in skin from the photo-injured mouse model. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis showed mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) to be the most abundant signaling pathway. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis indicated that the top 55 significantly enriched GO terms mainly involved cellular processes, parts, and binding. These results revealed the beneficial role of the small molecule gene-encoding antioxidant peptide (OA-VI12) and its potential application as a protective agent against photodamage.

10.1007/s11010-019-03569-w  |  Genetics  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The aim of our study is to explore the regulation of C1QTNF1-AS1 on its target miR-221-3p/SOCS3 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To explore the underlying molecular regulation of non-coding RNA for HCC, differentially expressed patterns of lncRNAs and genes were examined by RNA-seq. GO and KEGG pathway analysis were done based on the function of mRNAs that mediated by differentially expressed lncRNAs. RT-qPCR and western blot were conducted to detect the mRNA and protein level expression of C1QTNF1-AS1, miR-221-3p, SOCS3 and key proteins in JAK/STAT signaling pathway in HCC tissues and cells. The target miRNA of differentially expressed C1QTNF1-AS1 and SOCS3 was miR-221-3p predicted by bioinformatics analysis. C1QTNF1-AS1 and SOCS3 was downregulated and miR-221-3p was upregulated in HCC tissues and cells. In HepG2 and Huh-7 cells, the overexpression of C1QTNF1-AS1 or SOCS3, and silencing of miR-221-3p inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion and JAK/STAT signaling pathway, while promoted cell apoptosis. The results of dual-luciferase assay indicated that C1QTNF1-AS1 regulated miR-221-3p and miR-221-3p targeted SOCS3 by directly binding. And the growth of HCC in vivo was impeded when C1QTNF1-AS1 was upregulated. Overexpression of C1QTNF1-AS1 could downregulate miR-221-3p thereby inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells.

10.3390/ijms20215392  |  None  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Watermelon is a good source of citrulline, a non-protein amino acid. Citrulline has several therapeutic and clinical implications as it produces nitric oxide via arginine. In plants, citrulline plays a pivotal role in nitrogen transport and osmoprotection. The purpose of this study was to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers associated with citrulline metabolism using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and understand the role of citrulline in watermelon domestication. A watermelon collection consisting of 187 wild, landraces, and cultivated accessions was used to estimate citrulline content. An association analysis involved a total of 12,125 SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) &gt;0.05 in understanding the population structure and phylogeny in light of citrulline accumulation. Wild egusi types and landraces contained low to medium citrulline content, whereas cultivars had higher content, which suggests that obtaining higher content of citrulline is a domesticated trait. GWAS analysis identified candidate genes (<i>f</i><i>errochelatase</i> and <i>a</i><i>cetolactate</i> <i>s</i><i>ynthase</i>) showing a significant association of SNPs with citrulline content. Haplotype networking indicated positive selection from wild to domesticated watermelon. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing genetic regulation of citrulline variation in plants by using a GWAS strategy. These results provide new insights into the citrulline metabolism in plants and the possibility of incorporating high citrulline as a trait in watermelon breeding programs.

10.1186/s12864-019-6250-8  |  Genetics  ,  None  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Gynostemma pentaphyllum is an important perennial medicinal herb belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. Aerial stem-to-rhizome transition before entering the winter is an adaptive regenerative strategy in G. pentaphyllum that enables it to survive during winter. However, the molecular regulation of aerial stem-to-rhizome transition is unknown in plants. Here, integrated transcriptome and miRNA analysis was conducted to investigate the regulatory network of stem-to-rhizome transition. 
  Results:  Nine transcriptome libraries prepared from stem/rhizome samples collected at three stages of developmental stem-to-rhizome transition were sequenced and a total of 5428 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. DEGs associated with gravitropism, cell wall biosynthesis, photoperiod, hormone signaling, and carbohydrate metabolism were found to regulate stem-to-rhizome transition. Nine small RNA libraries were parallelly sequenced, and seven significantly differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were identified, including four known and three novel miRNAs. The seven DEMs targeted 123 mRNAs, and six pairs of miRNA-target showed significantly opposite expression trends. The GpmiR166b-GpECH2 module involved in stem-to-rhizome transition probably promotes cell expansion by IBA-to-IAA conversion, and the GpmiR166e-GpSGT-like module probably protects IAA from degradation, thereby promoting rhizome formation. GpmiR156a was found to be involved in stem-to-rhizome transition by inhibiting the expression of GpSPL13A/GpSPL6, which are believed to negatively regulate vegetative phase transition. GpmiR156a and a novel miRNA Co.47071 co-repressed the expression of growth inhibitor GpRAV-like during stem-to-rhizome transition. These miRNAs and their targets were first reported to be involved in the formation of rhizomes. In this study, the expression patterns of DEGs, DEMs and their targets were further validated by quantitative real-time PCR, supporting the reliability of sequencing data. 
  Conclusions:  Our study revealed a comprehensive molecular network regulating the transition of aerial stem to rhizome in G. pentaphyllum. These results broaden our understanding of developmental phase transitions in plants.

10.3390/ijms20133334  |  None  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   We examined the substrate preference of <i>Cuphea paucipetala</i> acyl-ACP thioesterases, <i>CpFatB4</i> and <i>CpFatB5</i>, and gene expression changes associated with the modification of lipid composition in the seed, using <i>Brassica napus</i> transgenic plants overexpressing <i>CpFatB4</i> or <i>CpFatB5</i> under the control of a seed-specific promoter. <i>CpFatB4</i> seeds contained a higher level of total saturated fatty acid (FA) content, with 4.3 times increase in 16:0 palmitic acid, whereas <i>CpFatB5</i> seeds showed approximately 3% accumulation of 10:0 and 12:0 medium-chain FAs, and a small increase in other saturated FAs, resulting in higher levels of total saturated FAs. RNA-Seq analysis using entire developing pods at 8, 25, and 45 days after flowering (DAF) showed up-regulation of genes for β-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase I/II, stearoyl-ACP desaturase, oleate desaturase, and linoleate desaturase, which could increase unsaturated FAs and possibly compensate for the increase in 16:0 palmitic acid at 45 DAF in <i>CpFatB4</i> transgenic plants. In <i>CpFatB5</i> transgenic plants, many putative chloroplast- or mitochondria-encoded genes were identified as differentially expressed. Our results report comprehensive gene expression changes induced by alterations of seed FA composition and reveal potential targets for further genetic modifications.

10.1186/s12967-019-1800-z  |  Diagnosis  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Recently, circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been reported to be microRNA sponges and play essential roles in cancer development. This study aimed to evaluate whether circulating circRNAs could be used as diagnostic biomarkers for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). 
  Methods:  The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset was used to investigate differentially expressed circRNAs (DEcircRNAs) in paired LUAD tissues and adjacent nontumor tissues. The expression levels of the host genes were analyzed in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-LUAD dataset, and the prognostic value was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier plotter. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to validate the expression of candidate circRNAs in the LUAD plasma and cells. The CCK8 assay was used to measure the function of circRNAs in cell proliferation. Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network, gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed to predict the possible mechanisms and functions of circRNAs in LUAD. 
  Results:  Two upregulated and two downregulated circRNAs were identified as candidate circRNAs using bioinformatics analysis. qRT-PCR demonstrated that hsa_circ_0005962 was upregulated in LUAD plasma and cells, whereas hsa_circ_0086414 was downregulated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis confirmed that a signature comprising the two circRNAs had good diagnostic potential, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.81 (P &lt; 0.0001). In addition, we observed that overexpression of plasma hsa_circ_0086414 was related to EGFR mutations (P = 0.001). Plasma hsa_circ_0005962 displayed significantly different expression before and after surgery in patients with LUAD (P &lt; 0.0001). In vitro experiments suggested that hsa_circ_0005962 promoted LUAD cell proliferation. For future studies, we predicted the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network for hsa_circ_0005962. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that hsa_circ_0005962 might be involved in LUAD development. 
  Conclusion:  A circRNA signature was identified as a potential noninvasive biomarker for LUAD diagnosis.

10.1007/s00234-019-02154-8  |  Diagnosis  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Purpose:  Diffuse midline glioma with histone H3 K27M mutation is a new entity described in the 2016 update of the World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and imaging characteristics to predict the presence of H3 K27M mutation in spinal cord glioma using a machine learning-based classification model. 
  Methods:  A total of 41 spinal cord glioma patients consisting of 24 H3 K27M mutants and 17 wild types were enrolled in this retrospective study. A total of 17 clinical and radiological features were evaluated. The random forest (RF) model was trained with the clinical and radiological features to predict the presence of H3 K27M mutation. The diagnostic ability of the RF model was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Area under the ROC curves (AUC) was calculated. 
  Results:  MR imaging features of spinal cord diffuse midline gliomas were heterogeneous. Hemorrhage was the only variable that was able to differentiate H3 K27M mutated tumors from wild-type tumors in univariate analysis (p = 0.033). RF classifier yielded 0.632 classification AUC (95% CI, 0.456-0.808), 63.4% accuracy, 45.8% sensitivity, and 88.2% specificity. 
  Conclusion:  Our findings indicate that clinical and radiological features are associated with H3 K27M mutation status in spinal cord glioma.

10.1155/2019/6480865  |  Prognosis  Treatment  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) was the most aggressive histological type of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and accounted for 70-80% of cases of all RCC. The aim of this study was to identify the potential biomarker in ccRCC and explore their underlying mechanisms. Four profile datasets were downloaded from the GEO database to identify DEGs. GO and KEGG analysis of DEGs were performed by DAVID. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to predict hub genes. The hub gene expression within ccRCC across multiple datasets and the overall survival analysis were investigated utilizing the Oncomine Platform and UALCAN dataset, separately. A meta-analysis was performed to explore the relationship between the hub genes: EGFR and ccRCC. 127 DEGs (55 upregulated genes and 72 downregulated genes) were identified from four profile datasets. Integrating the result from PPI network, Oncomine Platform, and survival analysis, EGFR, FLT1, and EDN1 were screened as key factors in the prognosis of ccRCC. GO and KEGG analysis revealed that 127 DEGs were mainly enriched in 21 terms and 4 pathways. The meta-analysis showed that there was a significant difference of EGFR expression between ccRCC tissues and normal tissues, and the expression of EGFR in patients with metastasis was higher. This study identified 3 importance genes (EGFR, FLT1, and EDN1) in ccRCC, and EGFR may be a potential prognostic biomarker and novel therapeutic target for ccRCC, especially patients with metastasis.

10.1530/JOE-18-0493  |  Prognosis  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Offspring of diabetic mothers are susceptible to developing type 2 diabetes due to pancreatic islet dysfunction. However, the initiating molecular pathways leading to offspring pancreatic islet dysfunction are unknown. We hypothesized that maternal hyperglycemia alters offspring pancreatic islet transcriptome and negatively impacts offspring islet function. We employed an infusion model capable of inducing localized hyperglycemia in fetal rats residing in the left uterine horn, thus avoiding other factors involved in programming offspring pancreatic islet health. While maintaining euglycemia in maternal dams and right uterine horn control fetuses, hyperglycemic fetuses in the left uterine horn had higher serum insulin and pancreatic beta cell area. Upon completing infusion from GD20 to 22, RNA sequencing was performed on GD22 islets to identify the hyperglycemia-induced altered gene expression. Ingenuity pathway analysis of the altered transcriptome found that diabetes mellitus and inflammation/cell death pathways were enriched. Interestingly, the downregulated genes modulate more diverse biological processes, which includes responses to stimuli and developmental processes. Next, we performed ex and in vivo studies to evaluate islet cell viability and insulin secretory function in weanling and adult offspring. Pancreatic islets of weanlings exposed to late gestation hyperglycemia had decreased cell viability in basal state and glucose-induced insulin secretion. Lastly, adult offspring exposed to in utero hyperglycemia also exhibited glucose intolerance and insulin secretory dysfunction. Together, our results demonstrate that late gestational hyperglycemia alters the fetal pancreatic islet transcriptome and increases offspring susceptibility to developing pancreatic islet dysfunction.

Here, we describe an accurate method for measurement and analysis of spine morphology based on structured illumination microscopy (SIM) and computational geometry in cultured neurons. Surface mesh data converted from SIM images were comparable to data reconstructed from electron microscopic images. Dimensional reduction and machine learning applied to large data sets enabled identification of spine phenotypes caused by genetic mutations in key signal transduction molecules. This method, combined with time-lapse live imaging and glutamate uncaging, could detect plasticity-related changes in spine head curvature. The results suggested that the concave surfaces of spines are important for the long-term structural stabilization of spines by synaptic adhesion molecules.

10.3389/fonc.2019.00041  |  Treatment  |  SubfieldA  |  Review  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Glioma are the most common type of malignant brain tumor, with glioblastoma (GBM) representing the most common and most lethal type of glioma. Surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy using the alkylating agent Temozolomide (TMZ) remain the mainstay of treatment for glioma. While this multimodal regimen is sufficient to temporarily eliminate the bulk of the tumor mass, recurrence is inevitable and often poses major challenges for clinical management due to treatment resistance and failure to respond to targeted therapies. Improved tumor profiling capacity has enabled characterization of the genomic landscape of gliomas with the overarching goal to identify clinically relevant subtypes and inform treatment decisions. Increased tumor mutational load has been shown to correlate with higher levels of neoantigens and is indicative of the potential to induce a durable response to immunotherapy. Following treatment with TMZ, a subset of glioma has been identified to recur with increased tumor mutational load. These hypermutant recurrent glioma represent a subtype of recurrence with unique molecular vulnerabilities. In this review, we will elaborate on the current knowledge regarding the evolution of hypermutation in gliomas and the potential therapeutic opportunities that arise with TMZ-induced hypermutation in gliomas.

Several tools have been developed recently to decrease the complexity of the process. Artificial intelligence and machine learning methods offer promising results in predicting the binding affinities. It becomes possible to do accurate predictions by using the known protein-ligand interactions. In this study, the electrostatic potential values extracted from 3-dimensional grid cubes of the drug-protein binding sites are used for predicting binding affinities of related complexes. A new algorithm with a dynamic feature selection method was implemented, which is derived from Compressed Images For Affinity Prediction (CIFAP) study, to predict binding affinities of Checkpoint Kinase 1 and Caspase 3 inhibitors.

10.3233/SHTI190245  |  Prognosis  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The onset of acute kidney injury (AKI) during an intensive care unit (ICU) admission is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Developing novel methods to identify early AKI onset is of critical importance in preventing or reducing AKI complications. We built and applied multiple machine learning models to integrate clinical notes and structured physiological measurements and estimate the risk of new AKI onset using the MIMIC-III database. From the clinical notes, we generated clinically meaningful word representations and embeddings. Four supervised learning classifiers and mixed-feature deep learning architecture were used to construct prediction models. The best configurations consistently utilized both structured and unstructured clinical features and yielded competitive AUCs above 0.83. Our work suggests that integrating structured and unstructured clinical features can be effectively applied to assist clinicians in identifying the risk of incident AKI onset in critically-ill patients upon admission to the ICU.

10.1111/risa.13313  |  None  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The rise in economic disparity presents significant risks to global social order and the resilience of local communities. However, existing measurement science for economic disparity (e.g., the Gini coefficient) does not explicitly consider a probability distribution with information, deficiencies, and uncertainties associated with the underlying income distribution. This article introduces the quantification of Shannon entropy for income inequality across scales, including national-, subnational-, and city-level data. The probabilistic principles of Shannon entropy provide a new interpretation for uncertainty and risk related to economic disparity. Entropy and information-based conflict rise as world incomes converge. High-entropy instances can resemble both happy and prosperous societies as well as a socialist-communist social structure. Low entropy signals high-risk tipping points for anomaly and conflict detection with higher confidence. Finally, spatial-temporal entropy maps for U.S. cities offer a city risk profiling framework. The results show polarization of household incomes within and across Baltimore, Washington, DC, and San Francisco. Entropy produces reliable results at significantly reduced computational costs than Gini coefficients.

  Design/methodology/approach:  This paper is a narrative literature review. 
  Findings:  Informatics serve as a bridge between big data and its applications, which include artificial intelligence, predictive analytics and point-of-care clinical decision making. Healthcare investment returns, measured by overall population health, healthcare operation efficiency and quality, are currently considered to be suboptimal.

10.1038/s41598-019-50137-9  |  Genetics  ,  Other  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Mapping the structure of the mammalian brain at cellular resolution is a challenging task and one that requires capturing key anatomical features at the appropriate level of analysis. Although neuroscientific methods have managed to provide significant insights at the micro and macro level, in order to obtain a whole-brain analysis at a cellular resolution requires a meso-scopic approach. A number of methods can be currently used to detect and count cells, with, nevertheless, significant limitations when analyzing data of high complexity. To overcome some of these constraints, we introduce a fully automated Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based method for whole-brain image processing to Detect Neurons in different brain Regions during Development (DeNeRD). We demonstrate a high performance of our deep neural network in detecting neurons labeled with different genetic markers in a range of imaging planes and imaging modalities.

10.2174/1386207322666191129112433  |  Genetics  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Genes are known as functional patterns in the genome and are presumed to have biological significance. They can indicate binding sites for transcription factors and they encode certain proteins. Finding genes from biological sequences is a major task in computational biology for unraveling the mechanisms of gene expression. 
  Objective:  Planted motif finding problems are a class of mathematical models abstracted from the process of detecting genes from genome, in which a specific gene with a number of mutations is planted into a randomly generated background sequence, and then gene finding algorithms can be tested to check if the planted gene can be found in feasible time. 
  Methods:  In this work, a spectral rotation method based on triplet periodicity property is proposed to solve planted motif finding problems. 
  Results:  The proposed method gives significant tolerance of base mutations in genes. Specifically, genes having a number of substitutions can be detected from randomly generated background sequences. Experimental results on genomic data set from Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveal that genes can be visually distinguished. It is proposed that genes with about 50% mutations can be detected from randomly generated background sequences. 
  Conclusion:  It is found that with about 5 insertions or deletions, this method fails in finding the planted genes. For a particular case, if the deletion of bases is located at the beginning of the gene, that is, bases are not randomly deleted, then the tolerance of the method for base deletion is increased.

10.1021/acsomega.9b02439  |  None  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The scale-up of laboratory procedures to industrial production is the main challenge standing between ideation and the successful introduction of novel materials into commercial products. Retaining quality while ensuring high per-batch production yields is the main challenge. Batch processing and other dynamic strategies that preserve product quality can be applied, but they typically involve a variety of experimental parameters and functions that are difficult to optimize because of interdependencies that are often antagonistic. Adaptive Bayesian optimization is demonstrated here as a valuable support tool in increasing both the per-batch yield and quality of short polymer fibers, produced by wet spinning and shear dispersion methods. Through this approach, it is shown that short fiber dispersions with high yield and a specified, targeted fiber length distribution can be obtained with minimal cost of optimization, starting from sub-optimal processing conditions and minimal prior knowledge. The Bayesian function optimization demonstrated here for batch processing could be applied to other dynamic scale-up methods as well as to cases presenting higher dimensional challenges such as shape and structure optimization. This work shows the great potential of synergies between industrial processing, material engineering, and machine learning perspectives.

However, the largest obstacle towards the deployment of automated vehicles on public roads is their safety evaluation and validation. Undeniably, the role of cameras and Artificial Intelligence-based (AI) vision is vital in the perception of the driving environment and road safety. Although a significant number of studies on the detection and tracking of vehicles have been conducted, none of them focused on the role of vertical vehicle dynamics. For the first time, this paper analyzes and discusses the influence of road anomalies and vehicle suspension on the performance of detecting and tracking driving objects. To this end, we conducted an extensive road field study and validated a computational tool for performing the assessment using simulations. A parametric study revealed the cases where AI-based vision underperforms and may significantly degrade the safety performance of AVs.

10.1007/s11095-019-2671-y  |  Treatment  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Purpose:  Pitt Hopkins Syndrome (PTHS) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations of a specific gene, transcription factor 4 (TCF4), located on chromosome 18. PTHS results in individuals that have moderate to severe intellectual disability, with most exhibiting psychomotor delay. PTHS also exhibits features of autistic spectrum disorders, which are characterized by the impaired ability to communicate and socialize. PTHS is comorbid with a higher prevalence of epileptic seizures which can be present from birth or which commonly develop in childhood. Attenuated or absent TCF4 expression results in increased translation of peripheral ion channels K<sub>v</sub>7.1 and Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 which triggers an increase in after-hyperpolarization and altered firing properties. 
  Methods:  We now describe a high throughput screen (HTS) of 1280 approved drugs and machine learning models developed from this data. The ion channels were expressed in either CHO (K<sub>V</sub>7.1) or HEK293 (Na<sub>v</sub>1.8) cells and the HTS used either <sup>86</sup>Rb<sup>+</sup> efflux (K<sub>V</sub>7.1) or a FLIPR assay (Na<sub>v</sub>1.8). 
  Results:  The HTS delivered 55 inhibitors of K<sub>v</sub>7.1 (4.2% hit rate) and 93 inhibitors of Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 (7.2% hit rate) at a screening concentration of 10 μM. These datasets also enabled us to generate and validate Bayesian machine learning models for these ion channels. We also describe a structure activity relationship for several dihydropyridine compounds as inhibitors of Na<sub>v</sub>1.8. 
  Conclusions:  This work could lead to the potential repurposing of nicardipine or other dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists as potential treatments for PTHS acting via Na<sub>v</sub>1.8, as there are currently no approved treatments for this rare disorder.

10.1007/s13258-019-00848-0  |  None  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Maize is an important crop in the world, nitrogen stress severely reduces maize yield. Although a large number of studies have identified the expression changes of microRNAs (miRNAs) under N stress in several species, the miRNAs expression patterns of N-deficient plants under N resupply remain unclear. 
  Objective:  The primary objective of this study was to identify miRNAs in response to nitrogen stress and understand relevant physiological changes in nitrogen-deficient maize after nitrogen resupply. 
  Methods:  Physiological parameters were measured to study relevant physiological changes under different nitrogen conditions. Small RNA sequencing and qRT-PCR analysis were performed to understand the response of miRNAs under different nitrogen conditions. 
  Results:  The content of chlorophyll, soluble protein and nitrate nitrogen decreased than CK by 0.52, 0.49 and 0.82 times after N deficiency treatment and increased than ND by 0.52, 1.36 and 0.65 times after N resupply, respectively. Conversely, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) increased by 0.67 and 1.64 times than CK after N deficiency, respectively, and decreased by 0.09 and 0.35 times than ND after N resupply. A total of 226 known miRNAs were identified by sRNA sequencing; 106 miRNAs were differentially expressed between the control and N-deficient groups, and 103 were differentially expressed between the N-deficient and N-resupply groups (P &lt; 0.05). Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to further validate and analyze the expression of the identified miRNAs. A total of 1609 target genes were identified by target prediction, and some differentially expressed miRNAs were predicted to target transcription factors and functional proteins. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was used to determine the biological function of these targets and revealed that some miRNAs, such as miR169, miR1214, miR2199, miR398, miR408 and miR827 might be involved in nitrogen metabolism regulation. 
  Conclusion:  Our study comprehensively provides important information on miRNA functions and molecular mechanisms in response to N stress. These findings may assist to improve nitrogen availability in plants.

10.3390/ijms20133321  |  None  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Radish is a crucial vegetable crop of the <i>Brassicaceae</i> family with many varieties and large cultivated area in China. Radish is a cool season crop, and there are only a few heat tolerant radish varieties in practical production with little information concerning the related genes in response to heat stress. In this work, some physiological parameter changes of young leaves under short-term heat stress were detected. Furthermore, we acquired 1802 differentially expressed mRNAs (including encoding some heat shock proteins, heat shock factor and heat shock-related transcription factors), 169 differentially expressed lncRNAs and three differentially expressed circRNAs (novel_circ_0000265, novel_circ_0000325 and novel_circ_0000315) through strand-specific RNA sequencing technology. We also found 10 differentially expressed miRNAs (ath-miR159b-3p, athmiR159c, ath-miR398a-3p, athmiR398b-3p, ath-miR165a-5p, ath-miR169g-3p, novel_86, novel_107, novel_21 and ath-miR171b-3p) by small RNA sequencing technology. Through function prediction and enrichment analysis, our results suggested that the significantly possible pathways/complexes related to heat stress in radish leaves were circadian rhythm-plant, photosynthesis-antenna proteins, photosynthesis, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, arginine and proline metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, peroxisome and plant hormone signal transduction. Besides, we identified one lncRNA-miRNA-mRNAs combination responsive to heat stress. These results will be helpful for further illustration of molecular regulation networks of how radish responds to heat stress.

10.1186/s12870-019-1712-3  |  None  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are 3'-5' head-to-tail covalently closed non-coding RNA that have been proved to play essential roles in many cellular and developmental processes. However, no information relate to cucumber circRNAs is available currently, especially under salt stress condition. 
  Results:  In this study, we sequenced circRNAs in cucumber and a total of 2787 were identified, with 1934 in root and 44 in leaf being differentially regulated under salt stress. Characteristics analysis of these circRNAs revealed following features: most of them are exon circRNAs (79.51%) and they prefer to arise from middle exon(s) of parent genes (2035/2516); moreover, most of circularization events (88.3%) use non-canonical-GT/AG splicing signals; last but not least, pairing-driven circularization is not the major way to generate cucumber circRNAs since very few circRNAs (18) contain sufficient flanking complementary sequences. Annotation and enrichment analysis of both parental genes and target mRNAs were launched to uncover the functions of differentially expressed circRNAs induced by salt stress. The results showed that circRNAs may be paly roles in salt stress response by mediating transcription, signal transcription, cell cycle, metabolism adaptation, and ion homeostasis related pathways. Moreover, circRNAs may function to regulate proline metabolisms through regulating associated biosynthesis and degradation genes. 
  Conclusions:  The present study identified large number of cucumber circRNAs and function annotation revealed their possible biological roles in response to salt stress. Our findings will lay a solid foundation for further structure and function studies of cucumber circRNAs.

10.1186/s13104-019-4559-7  |  None  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Objective:  Soybean seed development is negatively impacted by elevated temperatures during seed fill, which can decrease seed quality and economic value. Prior germplasm screens identified an exotic landrace able to maintain ~ 95% seed germination under stress conditions that reduce germination dramatically (&gt; 50%) for typical soybean seeds. Seed transcriptomic analysis was performed for two soybean lines (a heat-tolerant landrace and a typical high-yielding adapted line) for dry, mature seed, 6-h imbibed seed and germinated seed. Seeds were produced in two environments: a typical Midwestern field and a heat stressed field located in the Midsouth soybean production region. 
  Results:  Transcriptomic analysis revealed 23-30K expressed genes in each seed tissue sample, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with ≥ twofold gene expression differences (at q-value &lt; 0.05) comprised ~ 5-44% of expressed genes. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on DEGs revealed enrichment in heat-tolerant seeds for genes annotated for general and temperature-specific stress, as well as protein-refolding. DEGs were also clustered in modules using weighted co-expressed gene network analysis, which were examined for enrichment of GO biological process terms. Collectively, our results provide new and valuable insights into this unique form of genetic abiotic stress tolerance and to soybean seed physiological responses to elevated temperatures.

10.1159/000503776  |  Treatment  |  SubfieldA  |  Review  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) occurs in approximately 10-12% of treatments. Whereas several definitions for IDH are available, a nadir systolic blood pressure carries the strongest relation with outcome. Whereas the relation between IDH may partly be based on patient characteristics, it is likely that also impaired organ perfusion leading to permanent damage, plays a role in this relationship. The pathogenesis of IDH is multifactorial and is based on a combination of a decline in blood volume (BV) and impaired vascular resistance at a background of a reduced cardiovascular reserve. Measurements of absolute BV based on an on-line dilution method appear more promising than relative BV measurements in the prediction of IDH. Also, feedback treatments in which ultrafiltration rate is automatically adjusted based on changes in relative BV have not yet resulted in improvement. Frequent assessment of dry weight, attempting to reduce interdialytic weight gain and prescribing more frequent or longer dialysis treatments may aid in preventing IDH. The impaired vascular response can be improved using isothermic or cool dialysis treatment which has also been associated with a reduction in end organ damage, although their effect on mortality has not yet been assessed. For the future, identification of vulnerable patients based on artificial intelligence and on-line assessment of markers of organ perfusion may aid in individualizing treatment prescription, which will always remain dependent on the clinical context of the patient.

10.3233/SHTI190425  |  Other  |  SubfieldA  |  Review  |  ResearchTypeA  |   In the present study, we intended to solve identification problems in analyzing the results of microbiology by proactive man-machine interaction. We modified the analytics software MOMO so that it flags laboratory results containing textual elements unknown to the thesaurus, and a human expert assigns the elements to the respective existing thesaurus elements or creates new ones. In 773,309 laboratory results, roughly 2.6% contained unassigned elements and would have been ignored in thesaurus-based analyses for purposes other than simply reporting microbiological findings to physicians. In current use, the thesaurus is kept up to date with synonyms, syntactic deviations, misspellings, and entries not contained earlier, with man-machine interaction of 2-3 hours per week. This approach helps to accommodate both up-to-date clinical reporting for immediate patient care as well as up-to-date queries for infection surveillance and epidemiology, outbreak management, quality control and benchmarking, and antimicrobial stewardship.

10.1016/j.burns.2018.10.027  |  Genetics  ,  Prognosis  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   After similar extent of injury there is considerable variability in scarring between individuals, in part due to genetic factors. This study aimed to identify genetic variants associated with scar height and pliability after burn injury. An exome-wide array association study and gene pathway analysis were performed on a prospective cohort of 665 patients treated for burn injury. Outcomes were scar height (SH) and scar pliability (SP) sub-scores of the modified Vancouver Scar Scale (mVSS). DNA was genotyped using the Infinium<sup>®</sup> HumanCoreExome-24 BeadChip. Associations between genetic variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and SH and SP were estimated using an additive genetic model adjusting for age, sex, number of surgical procedures and % total body surface area of burn in subjects of European ancestry. No individual genetic variants achieved the cut-off threshold of significance. Gene regions were analysed for spatially correlated single nucleotide polymorphisms and significant regions identified using comb-p software. This gene list was subject to gene pathway analysis to find which biological process terms were over-represented. Using this approach biological processes related to the nervous system and cell adhesion were the predominant gene pathways associated with both SH and SP. This study suggests genes associated with innervation may be important in scar fibrosis. Further studies using similar and larger datasets will be essential to validate these findings.

10.1186/s13058-018-1090-z  |  Genetics  ,  Treatment  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  BRCA1-mutated cancers exhibit deficient homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair, resulting in extensive copy number alterations and genome instability. HR deficiency can also arise in tumors without a BRCA1 mutation. Compared with other breast tumors, HR-deficient, BRCA1-like tumors exhibit worse prognosis but selective chemotherapeutic sensitivity. Presently, patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) who do not respond to hormone endocrine-targeting therapy are given cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, more recent evidence showed a similar genomic profile between BRCA1-deficient TNBCs and hormone-receptor-positive tumors. Characterization of the somatic alterations of BRCA1-like hormone-receptor-positive breast tumors as a group, which is currently lacking, can potentially help develop biomarkers for identifying additional patients who might respond to chemotherapy. 
  Methods:  We retrained and validated a copy-number-based support vector machine (SVM) classifier to identify HR-deficient, BRCA1-like breast tumors. We applied this classifier to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) breast tumors. We assessed mutational profiles and proliferative capacity by covariate-adjusted linear models and identified differentially methylated regions using DMRcate in BRCA1-like hormone-receptor-positive tumors. 
  Results:  Of the breast tumors in TCGA and METABRIC, 22% (651/2925) were BRCA1-like. Stratifying on hormone-receptor status, 13% (302/2405) receptor-positive and 69% (288/417) triple-negative tumors were BRCA1-like. Among the hormone-receptor-positive subgroup, BRCA1-like tumors showed significantly increased mutational burden and proliferative capacity (both P &lt; 0.05). Genome-scale DNA methylation analysis of BRCA1-like tumors identified 202 differentially methylated gene regions, including hypermethylated BRCA1. Individually significant CpGs were enriched for enhancer regions (P &lt; 0.05). The hypermethylated gene sets were enriched for DNA and chromatin conformation (all Bonferroni P &lt; 0.05). 
  Conclusions:  To provide insights into alternative classification and potential therapeutic targeting strategies of BRCA1-like hormone-receptor-positive tumors we developed and applied a novel copy number classifier to identify BRCA1-like hormone-receptor-positive tumors and their characteristic somatic alteration profiles.

10.1111/jch.13700  |  Other  ,  Prognosis  |  SubfieldA  |  Review  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) based on pattern recognition. There are different forms of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms that are being used to identify and predict blood pressure (BP) and other measures of cardiovascular risk. Since 1999, starting with neural network methods, ML has been used to gauge the relationship between BP and pulse wave forms. Since then, the scope of the research has expanded to using different cardiometabolic risk factors like BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio in concert with BP and its various pharmaceutical agents to estimate biochemical measures (like HDL cholesterol, LDL and total cholesterol, fibrinogen, and uric acid) as well as effectiveness of anti-hypertensive regimens. Data from large clinical trials like the SPRINT are being re-analyzed by ML methods to unearth new findings and identify unique relationships between predictors and outcomes. In summary, AI and ML methods are gaining immense attention in the management of chronic disease. Elevated BP is a very important early metric for the risk of development of cardiovascular and renal injury; therefore, advances in AI and ML will aid in early disease prediction and intervention.

We have the task to plan and realize this through human imagination, creativity, and applicability for the clarification of the direction of the development and utilization of this technology. One thing that is clear is that it is important to understand what information is needed, how to interpret it, what will be the outcomes, and how to respond in artificial intelligence and Internet of Things era. Therefore, we would like to briefly discuss the characteristics of smart healthcare, and, suggest one approach that is easily applicable in the current situation.

10.1016/j.ygeno.2018.01.003  |  Genetics  ,  Prognosis  ,  Treatment  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Many experimental and computational studies have identified key protein coding genes in initiation and progression of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, the number of researches that tried to reveal the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in ESCC has been limited. LncRNAs are one of the important regulators of cancers which are transcribed dominantly in the genome and in various conditions. The main goal of this study was to use a systems biology approach to predict novel lncRNAs as well as protein coding genes associated with ESCC and assess their prognostic values. By using microarray expression data for mRNAs and lncRNAs from a large number of ESCC patients, we utilized "Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis" (WGCNA) method to make a big coding-non-coding gene co-expression network, and discovered important functional modules. Gene set enrichment and pathway analysis revealed major biological processes and pathways involved in these modules. After selecting some protein coding genes involved in biological processes and pathways related to cancer, we used "LncTar", a computational tool to predict potential interactions between these genes and lncRNAs. By combining interaction results with Pearson correlations, we introduced some novel lncRNAs with putative key regulatory roles in the network. Survival analysis with Kaplan-Meier estimator and Log-rank test statistic confirmed that most of the introduced genes are associated with poor prognosis in ESCC. Overall, our study reveals novel protein coding genes and lncRNAs associated with ESCC, along with their predicted interactions. Based on the promising results of survival analysis, these genes can be used as good estimators of patients' survival, or even can be analyzed further as new potential signatures or targets for the therapy of ESCC disease.

PMID:32002978  |  Other  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Purpose:  Sporadic hemiplegic migraine (SHM) is characterized by a prolonged motor aura that accompanies a migraine attack, and its underlying pathophysiology remains unclear. Functional image during the event can help to explore the mechanism. 
  Case report:  We report a finding of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in a 15-year-old female with SHM. She presented with recurrent right arm weakness and pain with migrainous headache. A video electroencephalogram showed no evidence of epilepsy during the events. Subtraction of ictal-interictal FDG-PET coregistered to magnetic resonance imaging was performed for the image analysis. In comparison with the interictal state, the FDG-PET image showed decreased glucose metabolism in the bilateral dorsal lateral frontal cortices and bilateral occipital cortices, whereas increased metabolism in the left precentral motor cortex and right premotor cortex. 
  Conclusion:  These findings reveal an increase in metabolism in the motor cortex during general cortical dysfunction in the frontal and occipital cortices in SHM. Key words: FDG-PET, hemiplegic migraine, migraine, positron emission tomography, SISCOM.

10.1063/1.5120106  |  None  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   This paper addresses the consensus problem of discrete-time multiagent systems (DTMASs), which are subject to input saturation and lack of the information of agent dynamics. In the previous works, the DTMASs with input saturation can achieve semiglobal consensus by utilizing the low gain feedback (LGF) method, but computing the LGF matrices by solving the modified algebraic Riccati equation requires the knowledge of agent dynamics. In this paper, motivated by the reinforcement learning method, we propose a model-free Q-learning algorithm to obtain the LGF matrices for the DTMASs achieving global consensus. Firstly, we define a Q-learning function and deduce a Q-learning Bellman equation, whose solution can work out the LGF matrix. Then, we develop an iterative Q-learning algorithm to obtain the LGF matrix without the requirement of the knowledge about agent dynamics. Moreover, the DTMASs can achieve global consensus. Lastly, some simulation results are proposed to validate the effectiveness of the Q-learning algorithm and show the effect on the rate of convergence from the initial states of agents and the input saturation limit.

10.1186/s12885-019-6101-7  |  Prognosis  ,  Genetics  ,  Treatment  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Predicting lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) risk is crucial in determining further treatment strategies. Molecular biomarkers may improve risk stratification for LUAD. 
  Methods:  We analyzed the gene expression profiles of LUAD patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We initially used three distinct algorithms (sigFeature, random forest, and univariate Cox regression) to evaluate each gene's prognostic relevance. Survival related genes were then fitted into the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model to build a risk prediction model for LUAD. After 100,000 times of calculation and model construction, a 16-gene-based prediction model capable of classifying LUAD patients into high-risk and low-risk groups was successfully built. 
  Results:  Using a combined strategy, we initially identified 2472 significant survival-related genes. Functional enrichment analysis demonstrated these genes' relevance to tumor initiation and progression. Using the LASSO method, we successfully built a reliable risk prediction model. The risk model was validated in two external sets and an independent set. The expression of these 16 genes was highly correlated with patients' risk. High-risk group patients witnessed poorer recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to low-risk group patients. Moreover, stratification analysis and decision curve analysis (DCA) confirmed the independence and potential translational value of this predictive tool. We also built a nomogram comprising risk model and stage to predict OS for LUAD patients. 
  Conclusions:  Our risk model may serve as a practical and reliable prognosis predictive tool for LUAD and could provide novel insights into the understanding of the molecular mechanism of this disease.

10.1016/j.ygeno.2018.05.016  |  Genetics  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The fast and affordable sequencing of large clinical and environmental metagenomic datasets opens up new horizons in medical and biotechnological applications. It is believed that today we have described only about 1% of the microorganisms on the Earth, therefore, metagenomic analysis mostly deals with unknown species in the samples. Microbial communities in extreme environments may contain genes with high biotechnological potential, and clinical metagenomes, related to diseases, may uncover still unknown pathogens and pathological mechanisms in known diseases. While the species-level identification and description of the taxa in the samples do not seem to be possible today, we can search for novel genes with known functions in these samples, using numerous techniques, including artificial intelligence tools, like the hidden Markov models (HMMs). Here we describe a simple-to-use webserver, the MetaHMM, which is capable of homology-based automatic model-building for the genes to be searched for, and it also finds the closest matches in the metagenome. The webserver uses already highly successful building blocks: it performs multiple alignments by applying Clustal Omega, builds a hidden Markov model with HMMER components of hmmbuild and uses hmmsearch for finding similar sequences to the specified model in the metagenomes. The webserver is publicly available at https://metahmm.pitgroup.org.

10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2018.10.071  |  Robotics  ,  Treatment  |  SubfieldA  |  Review  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Europe has changed remarkably over the past decades and so have concepts and outcomes of esophageal atresia repair. In this article, both the efforts to create a united Europe and the achievements in dealing with esophageal atresia from the 1950s on are outlined. Furthermore, this paper deals with the future of pediatric surgery and is focused on two aspects: the "Fourth Industrial Revolution" which builds on the digital revolution, artificial intelligence and robotics, and its potential impact on pediatric surgery and the life of patients. I suggest that pediatric surgeons should participate and lead in the development of machine learning, data control, assuring appropriate use of machines, control misuse, and in particular ensure appropriate maintenance of ethical standards. Changes in health care structures within Europe, in particular the effect of centralization, will affect the concept of treatment for patients with rare diseases.

10.1371/journal.pone.0221460  |  None  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  The ripening process of olive fruits is associated with chemical and/or enzymatic specific transformations, making them particularly attractive to animals and humans. In olive drupes, including 'Cassanese' ones, ripening is usually accompanied by progressive chromatic change, resulting in a final red-brown colourization of both epidermis and mesocarp. This event has an exception in the 'Leucocarpa', in which we observed the destabilization in the equilibrium between the chlorophyll metabolism and that of the other pigments, particularly the anthocyanins, whose switch-off during maturation promotes the white colouration of the fruits. Recently, transcription profiling of 'Leucocarpa' and 'Cassanese' olives along ripening, performed through an Illumina RNA-seq approach, has provided useful insights on genes functions involved in fruit maturation such as those related to the biosynthesis of flavonoids and anthocyanins. 
  Methodology:  To assess expression alterations of genes involved in flavonoids and anthocyanins biosynthetic pathways during ripening, possibly caused by small nuclear RNA (snRNA) in olive drupes, snRNA libraries from 'Leucocarpa' and 'Cassanese' were constructed with RNAs extracted at 100 and 130 Days After Flowering (DAF) and sequenced by an Illumina approach. 130 conserved microRNAs (miRNA) in the Viridiplantae belonging to 14 miRNA families were identified. Regarding the 130 conserved miRNAs, approximately the 48% were identified in all libraries, 5 and 18 miRNAs were shared between the "Cassanese" (C100, C130) and "Leucocarpa" (L100, L130) libraries, respectively. 
  Conclusion:  For the remaining reads not-matching with known miRNAs in the Viridiplantae, we combined secondary structure and minimum free energy to discover novel olive miRNAs. Based on these analyses, 492 sequences were considered as putative novel miRNAs. The putative target genes of identified miRNA were computationally predicted by alignment with the olive drupe transcripts obtained from the same samples. A total of 218 transcripts were predicted as targets of 130 known and 492 putative novel miRNAs. Interestingly, some identified target genes are involved in negative regulation of anthocyanin metabolic process. Quantification of the expression pattern of three miRNA and their target transcripts by qRT-PCR assay confirmed the results of Illumina sequencing.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btz330  |  Prognosis  ,  Treatment  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Motivation:  The computational modeling of peptide display by class I major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) is essential for peptide-based therapeutics design. Existing computational methods for peptide-display focus on modeling the peptide-MHC-binding affinity. However, such models are not able to characterize the sequence features for the other cellular processes in the peptide display pathway that determines MHC ligand selection. 
  Results:  We introduce a semi-supervised model, DeepLigand that outperforms the state-of-the-art models in MHC Class I ligand prediction. DeepLigand combines a peptide language model and peptide binding affinity prediction to score MHC class I peptide presentation. The peptide language model characterizes sequence features that correspond to secondary factors in MHC ligand selection other than binding affinity. The peptide embedding is learned by pre-training on natural ligands, and can discriminate between ligands and non-ligands in the absence of binding affinity prediction. Although conventional affinity-based models fail to classify peptides with moderate affinities, DeepLigand discriminates ligands from non-ligands with consistently high accuracy. 
  Availability and implementation:  We make DeepLigand available at https://github.com/gifford-lab/DeepLigand.

PMID:30919611  |  None  |  SubfieldA  |  Review  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The digital universe remains a black box. Despite attaining high-technology capabilities like artificial intelligence and cognitive computing, "Big Data" analytics have failed to keep pace with surging data production. At the same time, the falling costs of cloud storage and distributed systems have made mass data storage cheaper and more accessible. These effects have produced a chasm between data that is stored and data that can be readily analyzed and understood. Enticed by the promise of extracting future value from rising data stockpiles, organizations now retain massive quantities of data that they cannot presently know or effectively manage. This rising sea of "dark data" now represents the vast majority of the digital universe. Dark data presents a quandary for organizations and the judicial system. For organizations, the inability to know the contents of retained dark data produces invisible risk under a spreading patchwork of digital privacy and data governance laws, most notably in the medical and consumer protection areas. For courts increasingly confronted with Big Data-derived evidence, dark data may shield critical information from judicial view while embedding subjective influences within seemingly objective methods. To avoid obscuring organizational risk and producing erroneous outcomes in the courtroom, decision-makers must achieve a new awareness of dark data’s presence and its ability to undermine Big Data’s vaunted advantages.

10.1371/journal.pone.0207191  |  None  |  SubfieldA  |  Review  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) requires a descriptor that is robust to changes in viewing conditions in real time application. Many different descriptors had been proposed in the literature for example floating-point descriptors (SIFT and SURF) and binary descriptors (BRIEF, ORB, BRISK and FREAK). According to literature, floating-point descriptors are not suitable for real-time application because its operating speed does not satisfy real-time constraints. Binary descriptors have been developed with compact sizes and lower computation requirements. However, it is unclear which binary descriptors are more appropriate for MAR. Hence, a distinctive and efficient accuracy measurement of four state-of-the-art binary descriptors, namely, BRIEF, ORB, BRISK and FREAK were performed using the Mikolajczyk dataset and ALOI dataset to identify the most appropriate descriptor for MAR in terms of computation time and robustness to brightness, scale and rotation changes. The obtained results showed that FREAK is the most appropriate descriptor for MAR application as it able to produce an application that are efficient (shortest computation time) and robust towards scale, rotation and brightness changes.

10.1093/nar/gkz410  |  Genetics  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Interest in the biological roles of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) has resulted in growing numbers of studies that produce large sets of candidate genes, for example, differentially expressed between two conditions. For sets of protein-coding genes, ontology and pathway analyses are powerful tools for generating new insights from statistical enrichment of gene features. Here we present the LnCompare web server, an equivalent resource for studying the properties of lncRNA gene sets. The Gene Set Feature Comparison mode tests for enrichment amongst a panel of quantitative and categorical features, spanning gene structure, evolutionary conservation, expression, subcellular localization, repetitive sequences and disease association. Moreover, in Similar Gene Identification mode, users may identify other lncRNAs by similarity across a defined range of features. Comprehensive results may be downloaded in tabular and graphical formats, in addition to the entire feature resource. LnCompare will empower researchers to extract useful hypotheses and candidates from lncRNA gene sets.

10.3390/s19040833  |  None  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The traditional Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has evolved towards intelligent IoT applications which exploit knowledge produced by IoT devices using artificial intelligence techniques. Knowledge sharing between IoT devices is a challenging issue in this trend. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge of Things (KoT) framework which enables sharing self-taught knowledge between IoT devices which require similar or identical knowledge without help from the cloud. The proposed KoT framework allows an IoT device to effectively produce, cumulate, and share its self-taught knowledge with other devices at the edge in the vicinity. This framework can alleviate behavioral repetition in users and computational redundancy in systems in intelligent IoT applications. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concept, we examine a smart home case study and build a prototype of the KoT framework-based smart home system. Experimental results show that the proposed KoT framework reduces the response time to use intelligent IoT devices from a user's perspective and the power consumption for compuation from a system's perspective.

10.1021/acs.est.8b06586  |  None  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   In recent years, several methods have emerged to estimate the emissions and health, environmental, and climate change damages avoided by interventions such as energy efficiency, demand response, and the integration of renewables. However, differing assumptions employed in these analyses could yield contradicting recommendations regarding intervention implementation. We test the magnitude of the effect of using different key assumptions-average vs marginal emissions, year of calculation, temporal and regional scope, and inclusion of nonemitting generation-to estimate Mid-Atlantic region power pool (PJM) emissions and damage factors. We further highlight the importance of factor selection by evaluating three illustrative 2017 power system examples in PJM. We find that for a simple building lighting intervention, using average emissions factors incorporating nonemitting generation <i>underestimates</i> avoided damages by 45% compared to marginal factors. For PJM demand response, outdated marginal emissions factors from 2016 <i>overestimate</i> avoided damages by 25% compared to 2017 factors. Our assessment of PJM summer load further suggests that fossil-only average emissions factors <i>overestimate</i> damages by 63% compared to average factors incorporating nonemitting generation. We recommend that energy modelers carefully select appropriate emissions metrics when performing their analyses. Furthermore, since the U.S. electric grid is rapidly changing, we urge decision-makers to frequently update (and consider forecasting) grid emissions factors.

10.1103/PhysRevE.100.012201  |  None  |  SubfieldA  |  Research  |  ResearchTypeA  |   We investigate here how the optical properties at low frequencies affect the actuation dynamics and emerging chaotic behavior in a double-beam torsion actuator at nanoscale separations (&lt;200nm), where the Casimir forces and torques play a major role. In fact, we take into account differences of the Casimir force due to alternative modeling of optical properties at low frequencies, where measurements are not feasible, via the Drude and plasma models, and repercussions by different material preparation conditions. For conservative autonomous actuation, bifurcation and phase portrait analysis indicate that both factors affect the stability of an actuating device in such a way that stronger Casimir forces and torques will favor increased unstable behavior. The latter will be enhanced by unbalanced application of electrostatic voltages in double-beam actuating systems. For the case of a time-periodic driving force, we use a Melnikov function and a phase plane analysis to study the emerging chaotic behavior with respect to the Drude and plasma modeling and material preparation conditions. We find indications that any factor that leads to stronger Casimir interactions will aid chaotic behavior and prevent long term prediction of the actuating dynamics. Moreover, in a double-beam actuator chaoticity will be amplified by the application of unbalanced electrostatic voltages. Therefore, the details of modeling of optical properties and the material preparations conditions must be carefully considered in the design of actuating devices at nanoscale because here Casimir forces are omnipresent and broadband type interactions.
