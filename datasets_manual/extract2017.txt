10.1038/s41467-017-01742-7  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Establishment of a functional vascular network is rate-limiting in embryonic development, tissue repair and engineering. During blood vessel formation, newly generated endothelial cells rapidly expand into primitive plexi that undergo vascular remodeling into circulatory networks, requiring coordinated growth inhibition and arterial-venous specification. Whether the mechanisms controlling endothelial cell cycle arrest and acquisition of specialized phenotypes are interdependent is unknown. Here we demonstrate that fluid shear stress, at arterial flow magnitudes, maximally activates NOTCH signaling, which upregulates GJA4 (commonly, Cx37) and downstream cell cycle inhibitor CDKN1B (p27). Blockade of any of these steps causes hyperproliferation and loss of arterial specification. Re-expression of GJA4 or CDKN1B, or chemical cell cycle inhibition, restores endothelial growth control and arterial gene expression. Thus, we elucidate a mechanochemical pathway in which arterial shear activates a NOTCH-GJA4-CDKN1B axis that promotes endothelial cell cycle arrest to enable arterial gene expression. These insights will guide vascular regeneration and engineering.

10.3390/s17040827  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Inertial measurement units (IMUs) are devices used, among other fields, in health applications, since they are light, small and effective. More concretely, IMUs have been demonstrated to be useful in the monitoring of motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). In this sense, most of previous works have attempted to assess PD symptoms in controlled environments or short tests. This paper presents the design of an IMU, called 9 × 3, that aims to assess PD symptoms, enabling the possibility to perform a map of patients' symptoms at their homes during long periods. The device is able to acquire and store raw inertial data for artificial intelligence algorithmic training purposes. Furthermore, the presented IMU enables the real-time execution of the developed and embedded learning models. Results show the great flexibility of the 9 × 3, storing inertial information and algorithm outputs, sending messages to external devices and being able to detect freezing of gait and bradykinetic gait. Results obtained in 12 patients exhibit a sensitivity and specificity over 80%. Additionally, the system enables working 23 days (at waking hours) with a 1200 mAh battery and a sampling rate of 50 Hz, opening up the possibility to be used for other applications like wellbeing and sports.

10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-0122  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Tumors are characterized by somatic mutations that drive biological processes ultimately reflected in tumor phenotype. With regard to radiographic phenotypes, generally unconnected through present understanding to the presence of specific mutations, artificial intelligence methods can automatically quantify phenotypic characters by using predefined, engineered algorithms or automatic deep-learning methods, a process also known as radiomics. Here we demonstrate how imaging phenotypes can be connected to somatic mutations through an integrated analysis of independent datasets of 763 lung adenocarcinoma patients with somatic mutation testing and engineered CT image analytics. We developed radiomic signatures capable of distinguishing between tumor genotypes in a discovery cohort (<i>n</i> = 353) and verified them in an independent validation cohort (<i>n</i> = 352). All radiomic signatures significantly outperformed conventional radiographic predictors (tumor volume and maximum diameter). We found a radiomic signature related to radiographic heterogeneity that successfully discriminated between EGFR<sup>+</sup> and EGFR<sup>-</sup> cases (AUC = 0.69). Combining this signature with a clinical model of EGFR status (AUC = 0.70) significantly improved prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.75). The highest performing signature was capable of distinguishing between EGFR<sup>+</sup> and KRAS<sup>+</sup> tumors (AUC = 0.80) and, when combined with a clinical model (AUC = 0.81), substantially improved its performance (AUC = 0.86). A KRAS<sup>+</sup>/KRAS<sup>-</sup> radiomic signature also showed significant albeit lower performance (AUC = 0.63) and did not improve the accuracy of a clinical predictor of KRAS status. Our results argue that somatic mutations drive distinct radiographic phenotypes that can be predicted by radiomics. This work has implications for the use of imaging-based biomarkers in the clinic, as applied noninvasively, repeatedly, and at low cost. <i>Cancer Res; 77(14); 3922-30. ©2017 AACR</i>.

10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3263-16.2017  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by two hallmark molecular pathologies: amyloid aβ<sub>1-42</sub> and Tau neurofibrillary tangles. To date, studies of functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) in individuals with preclinical AD have relied on associations with <i>in vivo</i> measures of amyloid pathology. With the recent advent of <i>in vivo</i> Tau-PET tracers it is now possible to extend investigations on fcMRI in a sample of cognitively normal elderly humans to regional measures of Tau. We modeled fcMRI measures across four major cortical association networks [default-mode network (DMN), salience network (SAL), dorsal attention network, and frontoparietal control network] as a function of global cortical amyloid [Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB)-PET] and regional Tau (AV1451-PET) in entorhinal, inferior temporal (IT), and inferior parietal cortex. Results showed that the interaction term between PiB and IT AV1451 was significantly associated with connectivity in the DMN and salience. The interaction revealed that amyloid-positive (aβ<sup>+</sup>) individuals show increased connectivity in the DMN and salience when neocortical Tau levels are low, whereas aβ<sup>+</sup> individuals demonstrate decreased connectivity in these networks as a function of elevated Tau-PET signal. This pattern suggests a hyperconnectivity phase followed by a hypoconnectivity phase in the course of preclinical AD.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This article offers a first look at the relationship between Tau-PET imaging with F<sup>18</sup>-AV1451 and functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) in the context of amyloid-PET imaging. The results suggest a nonlinear relationship between fcMRI and both Tau-PET and amyloid-PET imaging. The pattern supports recent conjecture that the AD fcMRI trajectory is characterized by periods of both hyperconnectivity and hypoconnectivity. Furthermore, this nonlinear pattern can account for the sometimes conflicting reports of associations between amyloid and fcMRI in individuals with preclinical Alzheimer's disease.

10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005833  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Theory of Mind (ToM), i.e. the ability to understand others' mental states, endows humans with highly adaptive social skills such as teaching or deceiving. Candidate evolutionary explanations have been proposed for the unique sophistication of human ToM among primates. For example, the Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis states that the increasing complexity of social networks may have induced a demand for sophisticated ToM. This type of scenario ignores neurocognitive constraints that may eventually be crucial limiting factors for ToM evolution. In contradistinction, the cognitive scaffolding hypothesis asserts that a species' opportunity to develop sophisticated ToM is mostly determined by its general cognitive capacity (on which ToM is scaffolded). However, the actual relationships between ToM sophistication and either brain volume (a proxy for general cognitive capacity) or social group size (a proxy for social network complexity) are unclear. Here, we let 39 individuals sampled from seven non-human primate species (lemurs, macaques, mangabeys, orangutans, gorillas and chimpanzees) engage in simple dyadic games against artificial ToM players (via a familiar human caregiver). Using computational analyses of primates' choice sequences, we found that the probability of exhibiting a ToM-compatible learning style is mainly driven by species' brain volume (rather than by social group size). Moreover, primates' social cognitive sophistication culminates in a precursor form of ToM, which still falls short of human fully-developed ToM abilities.

10.3233/JAD-161057  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  White matter signal abnormalities (WMSA) (also known as 'hyperintensities') on MRI are commonly seen in normal aging and increases have been noted in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but whether there is a spatial specificity to these increases is unknown. 
  Objective:  To discern whether or not there is a spatial pattern of WMSA in the brains of individuals with AD that differs from those who exhibit cognitively healthy aging. 
  Method:  Structural MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative public database were used to quantify WMSA in 35 regions of interest (ROIs). Regional measures were compared between cognitively healthy older controls (OC; n = 107) and individuals with a clinical diagnosis of AD (n = 127). Regional WMSA volume was also assessed in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 74) who were 6, 12, and 24 months away from AD conversion. 
  Results:  WMSA volume was significantly greater in AD compared to OC in 24 out of 35 ROIs after controlling for age, and nine were significantly higher after normalizing for total WMSA. Regions with greater WMSA volume in AD included rostral frontal, inferior temporal, and inferior parietal WM. In MCI, frontal and temporal regions demonstrated significantly greater WMSA volume with decreasing time-to-AD-conversion. 
  Discussion:  Individuals with AD have greater regional volume of WMSA compared to OC regardless of age or total WMSA volume. Accumulation of regional WMSA is linked to time to AD conversion in individuals with MCI. These findings indicate WMSA is an important pathological component of AD development.

10.1155/2017/5090454  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Previous studies have showed that arm position variations would significantly degrade the classification performance of myoelectric pattern-recognition-based prosthetic control, and the cascade classifier (CC) and multiposition classifier (MPC) have been proposed to minimize such degradation in offline scenarios. However, it remains unknown whether these proposed approaches could also perform well in the clinical use of a multifunctional prosthesis control. In this study, the online effect of arm position variation on motion identification was evaluated by using a motion-test environment (MTE) developed to mimic the real-time control of myoelectric prostheses. The performance of different classifier configurations in reducing the impact of arm position variation was investigated using four real-time metrics based on dataset obtained from transradial amputees. The results of this study showed that, compared to the commonly used motion classification method, the CC and MPC configurations improved the real-time performance across seven classes of movements in five different arm positions (8.7% and 12.7% increments of motion completion rate, resp.). The results also indicated that high offline classification accuracy might not ensure good real-time performance under variable arm positions, which necessitated the investigation of the real-time control performance to gain proper insight on the clinical implementation of EMG-pattern-recognition-based controllers for limb amputees.

10.1016/j.jocd.2017.03.005  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Osteoporosis is one of the major diseases that affects mostly postmenopausal women. Despite being a multifactorial disease, some genes have been shown to play an important role in osteoporosis. Bone mineral density (BMD) is still largely used to diagnose it, although many other biomarkers are used to better follow the disease onset. It has been shown that the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene could be a biomarker for risk of fractures as well as to predict lower BMD in patients with osteoporosis. The human APOE gene encodes 3 protein isoforms called ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4, resulting in 4 possible genotypes, because they are a product of a single nucleotide polymorphism found in this gene. So far, the APOE4 allele has been associated with low BMD in postmenopausal women and to incidence of bone breaking in older women. This study aimed to investigate the role of ApoE isoforms in a cohort of 413 postmenopausal Brazilian women. These patients were randomly recruited, clinically examined, and subjected to dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to measure their BMD. Patients were further grouped as normal BMD (T-score &lt; 0.5) or low BMD (T-score &gt; 1.0, osteopenic or osteoporotic). Patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis were further genotyped for APOE alleles as well as tested for many serum bone turnover biomarkers. Our data showed that presence of the APOE3 allele was associated with both higher BMDs and higher serum concentrations of osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase, biomarkers for bone formation. On the other hand, the APOE2 and APOE4 alleles were associated with lower BMD as well as higher levels of serum C-terminus collagen peptide and urinary deoxipyridinolines, biomarkers for bone resorption. However, these effects on lower BMD and bone resorption biomarkers observed in either APOE2 or APOE4 alleles were eliminated when patients' genotype carried the APOE3 allele. Codominance of the APOE3 allele was also associated with lesser cases of bone fractures in these patients within a 5-year follow-up. In conclusion, our data show that APOE4 may be associated with lower bone formation as well as increased risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures, whereas APOE3 seems to decrease lowering BMD in postmenopausal women, and its presence seemed to lower the incidence of bone breaking in patients with osteoporosis.

10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b02741  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Noncovalent binding of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to a protein surface is a unique protein handling technique to control protein function and stability. A diblock copolymer containing PEG and polyelectrolyte chains (PEGylated polyelectrolyte) is a promising candidate for noncovalent attachment of PEG to a protein surface because of the binding through multiple electrostatic interactions without protein denaturation. To obtain a deeper understanding of protein-polyelectrolyte interaction at the molecular level, we investigated the manner in which cationic PEGylated polyelectrolyte binds to anionic α-amylase in enzyme kinetic experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Cationic PEG-block-poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl) (PEG-b-PAMA) inhibited the enzyme activity of anionic α-amylase due to binding of PAMA chains. Enzyme kinetics revealed that the inhibition of α-amylase activity by PEG-b-PAMA is noncompetitive inhibition manner. In MD simulations, the PEG-b-PAMA molecule was initially located at six different placements of the x-, y-, and z-axis ±20 Å from the center of α-amylase, which showed that the PEG-b-PAMA nonspecifically bound to the α-amylase surface, corresponding to the noncompetitive inhibition manner that stems from the polymer binding to an enzyme surface other than the active site. In addition, the enzyme activity of α-amylase in the presence of PEG-b-PAMA was not inhibited by increasing the ionic strength, consistent with the MD simulation; i.e., PEG-b-PAMA did not interact with α-amylase in high ionic strength conditions. The results reported in this paper suggest that enzyme inhibition by PEGylated polyelectrolyte can be attributed to the random electrostatic interaction between protein and polyelectrolyte.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.10.058  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Diffusion MRI tractography produces massive sets of streamlines that contain a wealth of information on brain connections. The size of these datasets creates a need for automated clustering methods to group the streamlines into meaningful bundles. Conventional clustering techniques group streamlines based on their spatial coordinates. Neuroanatomists, however, define white-matter bundles based on the anatomical structures that they go through or next to, rather than their spatial coordinates. Thus we propose a similarity measure for clustering streamlines based on their position relative to cortical and subcortical brain regions. We incorporate this measure into a hierarchical clustering algorithm and compare it to a measure that relies on Euclidean distance, using data from the Human Connectome Project. We show that the anatomical similarity measure leads to a 20% improvement in the overlap of clusters with manually labeled tracts. Importantly, this is achieved without introducing any prior information from a tract atlas into the clustering algorithm, therefore without imposing the existence of any named tracts.

10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b00221  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Fusion of therapeutic proteins with the antibody Fc domain is a strategy widely applied to increase protein half-life in plasma. In our previous study, we generated a recombinant human lactoferrin (hLF)-immunoglobulin G1 Fc fusion protein (hLF-hinge-CH2-CH3) with improved stability, biological activity, and pharmacokinetics ( Shiga , Y. et al. Eur J Pharm Sci. , 2015 , 67 , 136 - -143 ). However, the Fc domain in fusion proteins can potentially induce antibody-dependent and complement-dependent cytotoxicity and serious side effects. To overcome these drawbacks, we engineered an hLF-Fc fusion protein (hLF-CH2-CH3) without the Fc hinge region which is essential for engaging Fc receptors on immune cells and inducing complement-mediated cell lysis. The hLF-CH2-CH3 protein was stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) DG44 cells and compared for in vitro activities, thermal stability, pharmacokinetics, and attenuation of Fc-mediated immune effector functions with the conventional hinge-containing Fc fusion protein. Both hLF-hinge-CH2-CH3 and hLF-CH2-CH3 exhibited iron-binding activity, superior uptake by Caco-2 cells, similar thermal stability, and longer plasma half-life compared to recombinant hLF. However, in contrast to conventional hLF-hinge-CH2-CH3, hinge-deficient hLF-CH2-CH3 did not elicit Fc-mediated effector response potentially damaging for the target cells. Our findings demonstrate that conjugation of hinge-deficient Fc to therapeutic proteins is a promising strategy for improving their pharmacokinetic properties without enhancing effector functions. Cell-expressed hinge-deficient hLF-CH2-CH3 is a potential drug candidate with improved plasma half-life for parenteral administration.

10.1038/tp.2017.183  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Understanding molecular processes that link comorbid traits such as addictions and mental disorders can provide novel therapeutic targets. Neuregulin signaling pathway (NSP) has previously been implicated in schizophrenia, a neurodevelopmental disorder with high comorbidity to smoking. Using a Finnish twin family sample, we have previously detected association between nicotine dependence and ERBB4 (a neuregulin receptor), and linkage for smoking initiation at the ERBB4 locus on 2q33. Further, Neuregulin3 has recently been shown to associate with nicotine withdrawal in a behavioral mouse model. In this study, we scrutinized association and linkage between 15 036 common, low frequency and rare genetic variants in 10 NSP genes and phenotypes encompassing smoking and alcohol use. Using the Finnish twin family sample (N=1998 from 740 families), we detected 66 variants (representing 23 LD blocks) significantly associated (false discovery rate P&lt;0.05) with smoking initiation, nicotine dependence and nicotine withdrawal. We comprehensively annotated the associated variants using expression (eQTL) and methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL) analyses in a Finnish population sample. Among the 66 variants, we identified 25 eQTLs (in NRG1 and ERBB4), 22 meQTLs (in NRG3, ERBB4 and PSENEN), a missense variant in NRG1 (rs113317778) and a splicing disruption variant in ERBB4 (rs13385826). Majority of the QTLs in blood were replicated in silico using publicly available databases, with additional QTLs observed in brain. In conclusion, our results support the involvement of NSP in smoking behavior but not in alcohol use and abuse, and disclose functional potential for 56 of the 66 associated single-nucleotide polymorphism.

10.1186/s12879-017-2607-2  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  A two-dose preoperative vaccination schedule against HBV has been the widely accepted policy in Poland. However, its effectiveness has not yet been assessed. 
  Objective:  To evaluate a two-dose preoperative HBV vaccination policy by an assessment of the proportion of patients who don't present a protective level of anti-HBs (&lt;10.0 mIU/ml). 
  Methods:  Consecutive patients from surgical/gynecologic wards of 12 randomly selected hospitals in West Pomerania, Poland, hospitalized between 2010 and 2013, vaccinated against HBV with a two-dose regimen, were asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire. Serum samples were assayed for anti-HBs with the use of third-generation testing methods. To compare sensitivity versus specificity across a range of values for the ability to predict a dichotomous outcome (a protection against HBV infection) a Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was determined. 
  Results:  There were 193 patients, 58.5% women, median age 52 years. Almost a half (46.0%) of the patients were operated on within 0-60 days of taking the second vaccine dose, 16.2% - 61-180 days after, 37.8% &gt;180 days after. Anti-HBs titer was below a protective level in 49.2% of participants (0.0 mIU/ml in 17.8%, 0.1-9.9 mIU/ml in 31.4%); none of them were aware of this fact. Age ≤ 52 years (OR = 1.89) and having surgery more than 37.5 days after HBV vaccination (OR = 2.70) were associated with greater odds of being protected against HBV infection through vaccination. For the time frame between the second dose implementation and surgery 23 days, a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 22% for obtaining protection against HBV infection was found, for the time frame &gt;37.5 days - sensitivity remained high (80%), while specificity increased (41%); there was an apparent peek on the ROC curve between 38 and 60 day. In the group vaccinated 0-37.5 days before surgery, less patients had the protective level of anti-HBs titer than in vaccinated 38-60 days before surgery (32.3% vs 60.0%; p = 0.03). 
  Conclusions:  The success rate in achieving adequate immune protection with two dose HBV vaccination schedule in preoperatively vaccinated patients is relatively low, especially among those vaccinated less than five weeks prior to surgery. In more than a third of cases the standard three-dose regimen could have been implemented, as participants had time to complete a third dose. Current recommendations regarding a preoperative policy with a 2-dose vaccination schedule in Poland should be revised; the best time to perform surgery after the implementation of the second dose of vaccine in the context of patient protection against HBV infection would be between 38 and 60 days.

10.1007/s10822-017-0057-y  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The p53 protein activation protects the organism from propagation of cells with damaged DNA having oncogenic mutations. In normal cells, activity of p53 is controlled by interaction with MDM2. The well understood p53-MDM2 interaction facilitates design of ligands that could potentially disrupt or prevent the complexation owing to its emergence as an important objective for cancer therapy. However, thermodynamic quantification of the p53-peptide induced structural changes of the MDM2-protein remains an area to be explored. This study attempts to understand the conformational free energy and entropy costs due to this complex formation from the histograms of dihedral angles generated from molecular dynamics simulations. Residue-specific quantification illustrates that, hydrophobic residues of the protein contribute maximum to the conformational thermodynamic changes. Thermodynamic quantification of structural changes of the protein unfold the fact that, p53 binding provides a source of inter-element cooperativity among the protein secondary structural elements, where the highest affected structural elements (α2 and α4) found at the binding site of the protein affects faraway structural elements (β1 and Loop1) of the protein. The communication perhaps involves water mediated hydrogen bonded network formation. Further, we infer that in inhibitory F19A mutation of P53, though Phe19 is important in the recognition process, it has less prominent contribution in the stability of the complex. Collectively, this study provides vivid microscopic understanding of the interaction within the protein complex along with exploring mutation sites, which will contribute further to engineer the protein function and binding affinity.

Here, we extensively characterized the <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> activity and the mechanism of action of PQR309 (bimiralisib), a novel oral selective dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor under clinical evaluation, in preclinical lymphoma models.<b>Experimental Design:</b> This study included preclinical <i>in vitro</i> activity screening on a large panel of cell lines, both as single agent and in combination, validation experiments on <i>in vivo</i> models and primary cells, proteomics and gene-expression profiling, and comparison with other signaling inhibitors.<b>Results:</b> PQR309 had <i>in vitro</i> antilymphoma activity as single agent and in combination with venetoclax, panobinostat, ibrutinib, lenalidomide, ARV-825, marizomib, and rituximab. Sensitivity to PQR309 was associated with specific baseline gene-expression features, such as high expression of transcripts coding for the BCR pathway. Combining proteomics and RNA profiling, we identified the different contribution of PQR309-induced protein phosphorylation and gene expression changes to the drug mechanism of action. Gene-expression signatures induced by PQR309 and by other signaling inhibitors largely overlapped. PQR309 showed activity in cells with primary or secondary resistance to idelalisib.<b>Conclusions:</b> On the basis of these results, PQR309 appeared as a novel and promising compound that is worth developing in the lymphoma setting. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 24(1); 120-9. ©2017 AACR</i>.

10.1002/prot.25432  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Proteins often exist as their multimeric forms when they function as so-called biological assemblies consisting of the specific number and arrangement of protein subunits. Consequently, elucidating biological assemblies is necessary to improve understanding of protein function. Template-Based Modeling (TBM), based on known protein structures, has been used widely for protein structure prediction. Actually, TBM has become an increasingly useful approach in recent years because of the increased amounts of information related to protein amino acid sequences and three-dimensional structures. An apparently similar situation exists for biological assembly structure prediction as protein complex structures in the PDB increase, although the inference of biological assemblies is not a trivial task. Many methods using TBM, including ours, have been developed for protein structure prediction. Using enhanced profile-profile alignments, we participated in the 12th Community Wide Experiment on the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP12), as the FONT team (Group # 480). Herein, we present experimental procedures and results of retrospective analyses using our approach for the Quaternary Structure Prediction category of CASP12. We performed profile-profile alignments of several types, based on FORTE, our profile-profile alignment algorithm, to identify suitable templates. Results show that these alignment results enable us to find templates in almost all possible cases. Moreover, we have come to understand the necessity of developing a model selection method that provides improved accuracy. Results also demonstrate that, to some extent, finding templates of protein complexes is useful even for MEDIUM and HARD assembly prediction.

10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005694  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   With the recent technological developments a vast amount of high-throughput data has been profiled to understand the mechanism of complex diseases. The current bioinformatics challenge is to interpret the data and underlying biology, where efficient algorithms for analyzing heterogeneous high-throughput data using biological networks are becoming increasingly valuable. In this paper, we propose a software package based on the Prize-collecting Steiner Forest graph optimization approach. The PCSF package performs fast and user-friendly network analysis of high-throughput data by mapping the data onto a biological networks such as protein-protein interaction, gene-gene interaction or any other correlation or coexpression based networks. Using the interaction networks as a template, it determines high-confidence subnetworks relevant to the data, which potentially leads to predictions of functional units. It also interactively visualizes the resulting subnetwork with functional enrichment analysis.

10.1371/journal.pone.0174699  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAITs) are innate-like T cells that play a pivotal role in the host defense against infectious diseases, and are also implicated in autoimmune diseases, metabolic diseases, and cancer. Recent studies have shown that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from MAITs selectively redifferentiate into MAITs without altering their antigen specificity. Such a selective differentiation is a prerequisite for the use of MAITs in cell therapy and/or regenerative medicine. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. Here, we performed methylome and transcriptome analyses of MAITs during the course of differentiation from iPSCs. Our multi-omics analyses revealed that recombination-activating genes (RAG1 and RAG2) and DNA nucleotidylexotransferase (DNTT) were highly methylated with their expression being repressed throughout differentiation. Since these genes are essential for V(D)J recombination of the T cell receptor (TCR) locus, this indicates that nascent MAITs are kept from further rearrangement that may alter their antigen specificity. Importantly, we found that the repression of RAGs was assured in two layers: one by the modulation of transcription factors for RAGs, and the other by DNA methylation at the RAG loci. Together, our study provides a possible explanation for the unaltered antigen specificity in the selective differentiation of MAITs from iPSCs.

10.3390/s17071564  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, which can effectively analyze massive amounts of fault data and automatically provide accurate diagnosis results, have been widely applied to fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. Conventional AI methods are applied using features selected by a human operator, which are manually extracted based on diagnostic techniques and field expertise. However, developing robust features for each diagnostic purpose is often labour-intensive and time-consuming, and the features extracted for one specific task may be unsuitable for others. In this paper, a novel AI method based on a deep belief network (DBN) is proposed for the unsupervised fault diagnosis of a gear transmission chain, and the genetic algorithm is used to optimize the structural parameters of the network. Compared to the conventional AI methods, the proposed method can adaptively exploit robust features related to the faults by unsupervised feature learning, thus requires less prior knowledge about signal processing techniques and diagnostic expertise. Besides, it is more powerful at modelling complex structured data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using datasets from rolling bearings and gearbox. To show the superiority of the proposed method, its performance is compared with two well-known classifiers, i.e., back propagation neural network (BPNN) and support vector machine (SVM). The fault classification accuracies are 99.26% for rolling bearings and 100% for gearbox when using the proposed method, which are much higher than that of the other two methods.

10.1371/journal.pone.0185866  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Co-infections with HIV and HCV are very frequent among people who inject drugs (PWID). However, very few studies comparatively reconstructed the transmission patterns of both viruses in the same population. We have recruited 117 co-infected PWID during a recent HIV outbreak in Romania. Phylogenetic analyses were performed on HIV and HCV sequences in order to characterize and compare transmission dynamics of the two viruses. Three large HIV clusters (2 subtype F1 and one CRF14_BG) and thirteen smaller HCV transmission networks (genotypes 1a, 1b, 3a, 4a and 4d) were identified. Eighty (65%) patients were both in HIV and HCV transmission chains and 70 of those shared the same HIV and HCV cluster with at least one other patient. Molecular clock analysis indicated that all identified HIV clusters originated around 2006, while the origin of the different HCV clusters ranged between 1980 (genotype 1b) and 2011 (genotypes 3a and 4d). HCV infection preceded HIV infection in 80.3% of cases. Coincidental transmission of HIV and HCV was estimated to be rather low (19.65%) and associated with an outbreak among PWID during detention in the same penitentiary. This study has reconstructed and compared the dispersion of these two viruses in a PWID population.

10.1038/nprot.2017.124  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Noncoding DNA regions have central roles in human biology, evolution, and disease. ChromHMM helps to annotate the noncoding genome using epigenomic information across one or multiple cell types. It combines multiple genome-wide epigenomic maps, and uses combinatorial and spatial mark patterns to infer a complete annotation for each cell type. ChromHMM learns chromatin-state signatures using a multivariate hidden Markov model (HMM) that explicitly models the combinatorial presence or absence of each mark. ChromHMM uses these signatures to generate a genome-wide annotation for each cell type by calculating the most probable state for each genomic segment. ChromHMM provides an automated enrichment analysis of the resulting annotations to facilitate the functional interpretations of each chromatin state. ChromHMM is distinguished by its modeling emphasis on combinations of marks, its tight integration with downstream functional enrichment analyses, its speed, and its ease of use. Chromatin states are learned, annotations are produced, and enrichments are computed within 1 d.

10.1186/s12888-017-1532-7  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Seasonal changes and climatic factors like ambient temperature, sunlight duration and rainfall can influence suicidal behavior. 
  Methods:  This study analyses the relationship between seasonal changes and climatic variations and suicide attempts in 2131 young patients in Istanbul, Turkey. 
  Results:  In our study sample, there was an association between suicide attempts in youths and seasonal changes, as suicide attempts occurred most frequently during summer in females as well as in males. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the mean temperature over the past 10 days and temperature at the index day and suicide attempts in females. After seasonality effects were mathematically removed, the mean temperature 10 days before a suicide attempt remained significant in males only, indicating a possible short-term influence of temperature on suicide attempts. 
  Conclusions:  This study shows an association between suicide attempts of young people and climatic changes, in particular temperature changes as well as seasonal changes. Therefore, the influence of seasonal changes and climatic factors on young suicide attempters should get more attention in research to understand the biopsychosocial mechanisms playing a role in suicide attempts of young people. As suicide attempts most frequently occur in young people, further research is of considerable clinical importance.

10.1371/journal.pone.0188196  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Since anatomic MRI is presently not able to directly discern neuronal loss in Parkinson's Disease (PD), studying the associated functional connectivity (FC) changes seems a promising approach toward developing non-invasive and non-radioactive neuroimaging markers for this disease. While several groups have reported such FC changes in PD, there are also significant discrepancies between studies. Investigating the reproducibility of PD-related FC changes on independent datasets is therefore of crucial importance. We acquired resting-state fMRI scans for 43 subjects (27 patients and 16 normal controls, with 2 replicate scans per subject) and compared the observed FC changes with those obtained in two independent datasets, one made available by the PPMI consortium (91 patients, 18 controls) and a second one by the group of Tao Wu (20 patients, 20 controls). Unfortunately, PD-related functional connectivity changes turned out to be non-reproducible across datasets. This could be due to disease heterogeneity, but also to technical differences. To distinguish between the two, we devised a method to directly check for disease heterogeneity using random splits of a single dataset. Since we still observe non-reproducibility in a large fraction of random splits of the same dataset, we conclude that functional heterogeneity may be a dominating factor behind the lack of reproducibility of FC alterations in different rs-fMRI studies of PD. While global PD-related functional connectivity changes were non-reproducible across datasets, we identified a few individual brain region pairs with marginally consistent FC changes across all three datasets. However, training classifiers on each one of the three datasets to discriminate PD scans from controls produced only low accuracies on the remaining two test datasets. Moreover, classifiers trained and tested on random splits of the same dataset (which are technically homogeneous) also had low test accuracies, directly substantiating disease heterogeneity.

10.1002/cbin.10903  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the primary source of cells used for cell-based therapy in tissue engineering. MSCs are found in synovial fluid, a source that could be conveniently used for cartilage tissue engineering. However, the purification and characterization of SF-MSCs has been poorly documented in the literature. Here, we outline an easy-to-perform approach for the isolation and culture of MSCs derived from human synovial fluid (hSF-MSCs). We have successfully purified hSF-MSCs using magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) using the MSC surface marker, CD90. Purified SF-MSCs demonstrate significant renewal capacity following several passages in culture. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MACS-sorted CD90<sup>+</sup> cells could differentiated into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes in vitro. In addition, we show that these cells can generate cartilage tissue in micromass culture as well. This study demonstrates that MACS is a useful tool that can be used for the purification of hSF-MSCs from synovial fluid. The proliferation properties and ability to differentiate into chondrocytes make these hSF-MSCs a promising source of stem cells for applications in cartilage repair.

10.1038/s41598-017-17687-2  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   When making a choice with limited information, we explore new features through trial-and-error to learn how they are related. However, few studies have investigated exploratory behaviour when information is limited. In this study, we address, at both the behavioural and neural level, how, when, and why humans explore new feature dimensions to learn a new policy for choosing a state-space. We designed a novel multi-dimensional reinforcement learning task to encourage participants to explore and learn new features, then used a reinforcement learning algorithm to model policy exploration and learning behaviour. Our results provide the first evidence that, when humans explore new feature dimensions, their values are transferred from the previous policy to the new online (active) policy, as opposed to being learned from scratch. We further demonstrated that exploration may be regulated by the level of cognitive ambiguity, and that this process might be controlled by the frontopolar cortex. This opens up new possibilities of further understanding how humans explore new features in an open-space with limited information.

10.1186/s13062-017-0183-4  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a key role in normal tissue differentiation and cancer development through their tissue-specific expression in the human transcriptome. Recent investigations of macromolecular interactions have shown that tissue-specific lncRNAs form base-pairing interactions with various mRNAs associated with tissue-differentiation, suggesting that tissue specificity is an important factor controlling human lncRNA-mRNA interactions.Here, we report investigations of the tissue specificities of lncRNAs and mRNAs by using RNA-seq data across various human tissues as well as computational predictions of tissue-specific lncRNA-mRNA interactions inferred by integrating the tissue specificity of lncRNAs and mRNAs into our comprehensive prediction of human lncRNA-RNA interactions. Our predicted lncRNA-mRNA interactions were evaluated by comparisons with experimentally validated lncRNA-mRNA interactions (between the TINCR lncRNA and mRNAs), showing the improvement of prediction accuracy over previous prediction methods that did not account for tissue specificities of lncRNAs and mRNAs. In addition, our predictions suggest that the potential functions of TINCR lncRNA not only for epidermal differentiation but also for esophageal development through lncRNA-mRNA interactions.

10.1080/14015439.2016.1221445  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Objectives:  To quantify changes in the biomechanical properties of human excised vocal folds with defined artificial damage. 
  Methods:  The linear skin rheometer (LSR) was used to obtain a series of rheological measurements of shear modulus from the surface of 30 human cadaver vocal folds. The tissue samples were initially measured in a native condition and then following varying intensities of thermal damage. Histological examination of each vocal fold was used to determine the depth of artificial alteration. The measured changes in stiffness were correlated with the depth of cell damage. 
  Results:  For vocal folds in a pre-damage state the shear modulus values ranged from 537 Pa to 1,651 Pa (female) and from 583 Pa to 1,193 Pa (male). With increasing depth of damage from the intermediate layer of the lamina propria (LP), tissue stiffness increased consistently (compared with native values) following application of thermal damage to the vocal folds. The measurement showed an increase of tissue stiffness when the depth of tissue damage was extending from the intermediate LP layer downwards. 
  Conclusions:  Changes in the elastic characteristics of human vocal fold tissue following damage at defined depths were demonstrated in an in vitro experiment. In future, reproducible in vivo measurements of elastic vocal fold tissue alterations may enable phonosurgeons to infer the extent of subepithelial damage from changes in surface elasticity.

10.1038/sdata.2017.35  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Advances in high-throughput sequencing are reshaping how we perceive microbial communities inhabiting the human body, with implications for therapeutic interventions. Several large-scale datasets derived from hundreds of human microbiome samples sourced from multiple studies are now publicly available. However, idiosyncratic data processing methods between studies introduce systematic differences that confound comparative analyses. To overcome these challenges, we developed GutCyc, a compendium of environmental pathway genome databases (ePGDBs) constructed from 418 assembled human microbiome datasets using MetaPathways, enabling reproducible functional metagenomic annotation. We also generated metabolic network reconstructions for each metagenome using the Pathway Tools software, empowering researchers and clinicians interested in visualizing and interpreting metabolic pathways encoded by the human gut microbiome. For the first time, GutCyc provides consistent annotations and metabolic pathway predictions, making possible comparative community analyses between health and disease states in inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, and type 2 diabetes. GutCyc data products are searchable online, or may be downloaded and explored locally using MetaPathways and Pathway Tools.

10.1111/papr.12581  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background and aims:  According to existing literature, musicians are at risk of experiencing a range of painful musculoskeletal conditions. Recently, a novel digital technology was developed to investigate pain location and pain extent. The aim of this study was to describe pain location and pain extent in musicians using a digital method for pain drawing (PD) analysis. Additionally, the association between PD variables and clinical features were explored in musicians with pain. 
  Methods:  One hundred and fifty-eight musicians (90 women and 68 men; aged 22.4 ± 3.6 years) were recruited from Swiss and U.K. conservatories. Participants were asked to complete a survey including both background musical information and clinical features, the QuickDASH (QD) questionnaire, and the digital PDs. 
  Results:  Of the 158 participants, 126 musicians (79.7%) reported having pain, with higher prevalence in the areas of the neck and shoulders, the lower back, and the right arm. The mean percentage of pain extent was 3.1% ± 6.5%. The mean QD score was higher for musicians with pain than for those without pain. Additionally, the results indicated a positive correlation between the QD score and pain extent, and there were significant correlations between age and pain intensity, as well as between pain extent and pain intensity. 
  Conclusions:  The high prevalence of pain among musicians has been confirmed using a digital technique for PD acquisition and analysis. In addition, positive correlations between pain extent and upper limb disability have been demonstrated. Our findings highlight the need for effective prevention and treatment strategies for musicians.

10.1104/pp.16.01259  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Polycomb Group regulation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) is required to maintain cell differentiation and allow developmental phase transitions. This is achieved by the activity of three PcG repressive complex 2s (PRC2s) and the participation of a yet poorly defined PRC1. Previous results showed that apparent PRC1 components perform discrete roles during plant development, suggesting the existence of PRC1 variants; however, it is not clear in how many processes these components participate. We show that AtBMI1 proteins are required to promote all developmental phase transitions and to control cell proliferation during organ growth and development, expanding their proposed range of action. While AtBMI1 function during germination is closely linked to B3 domain transcription factors VAL1/2 possibly in combination with GT-box binding factors, other AtBMI1 regulatory networks require participation of different factor combinations. Conversely, EMF1 and LHP1 bind many H3K27me3 positive genes up-regulated in atbmi1a/b/c mutants; however, loss of their function affects expression of a different subset, suggesting that even if EMF1, LHP1, and AtBMI1 exist in a common PRC1 variant, their role in repression depends on the functional context.

PMID:31909397  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   While deep learning has led to remarkable advances across diverse applications, it struggles in domains where the data distribution changes over the course of learning. In stark contrast, biological neural networks continually adapt to changing domains, possibly by leveraging complex molecular machinery to solve many tasks simultaneously. In this study, we introduce <i>intelligent synapses</i> that bring some of this biological complexity into artificial neural networks. Each synapse accumulates task relevant information over time, and exploits this information to rapidly store new memories without forgetting old ones. We evaluate our approach on continual learning of classification tasks, and show that it dramatically reduces forgetting while maintaining computational efficiency.

A comparative study between the firefly algorithm and the well-known genetic algorithm was developed. The discussion revealed the superiority of using this new powerful algorithm over the well-known genetic algorithm. Moreover, different statistical tests were performed and no significant differences were found between all the models regarding their predictabilities. This ensures that simpler and faster models were obtained without any deterioration of the quality of the calibration.

10.1002/jsfa.7827  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  In soybean, at least 16 seed proteins have been identified as causing allergenic reactions in sensitive individuals. As a soybean genebank accession low in the immunodominant protein P34 (Gly m Bd 30K) has recently been found, introgression of the low-P34 trait into adapted soybean germplasm has been attempted in order to improve the safety of food products containing soybean protein. Therefore, marker-assisted selection and proteomics were applied to identify and characterize low-P34 soybeans. 
  Results:  In low-P34 lines selected from a cross-population, concentrations of the P34 protein as identified with a polyclonal antibody were reduced by 50-70% as compared to P34-containing controls. Using 2D electrophoresis and immunoblotting, the reduction of P34 protein was verified in low-P34 lines. This result was confirmed by liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric analysis, which revealed either a reduction or complete absence of the authentic P34 protein as suggested from presence or absence of a unique peptide useful for discriminating between conventional and low-P34 lines. 
  Conclusion:  Marker-assisted selection proved useful for identifying low-P34 soybean lines for the development of hypoallergenic soy foods. The status of the P34 protein in low-P34 lines needs further characterization. In addition, the food safety relevance of low-P34 soybeans should be tested in clinical studies. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.

10.1007/s00401-016-1626-1  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Changes in climbing fiber-Purkinje cell (CF-PC) synaptic connections have been found in the essential tremor (ET) cerebellum, and these changes are correlated with tremor severity. Whether these postmortem changes are specific to ET remains to be investigated. We assessed CF-PC synaptic pathology in the postmortem cerebellum across a range of degenerative movement disorders [10 Parkinson's disease (PD) cases, 10 multiple system atrophy (MSA) cases, 10 spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) cases, and 20 ET cases] and 25 controls. We observed differences in terms of CF pathological features across these disorders. Specifically, PD cases and ET cases both had more CFs extending into the parallel fiber (PF) territory, but ET cases had more complex branching and increased length of CFs in the PF territory along with decreased CF synaptic density compared to PD cases. MSA cases and SCA1 cases had the most severely reduced CF synaptic density and a marked paucity of CFs extending into the PF territory. Furthermore, CFs in a subset of MSA cases formed collateral branches parallel to the PC layer, a feature not seen in other diagnostic groups. Using unsupervised cluster analysis, the cases and controls could all be categorized into four clusters based on the CF pathology and features of PC pathology, including counts of PCs and their axonal torpedoes. ET cases and PD cases co-segregated into two clusters, whereas SCA1 cases and MSA cases formed another cluster, separate from the control cluster. Interestingly, the presence of resting tremor seemed to be the clinical feature that separated the cases into the two ET-PD clusters. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that these degenerative movement disorders seem to differ with respect to the pattern of CF synaptic pathology they exhibit. It remains to be determined how these differences contribute to the clinical presentations of these diseases.

10.1371/journal.pone.0170712  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Role of lncRNAs in human adaptive immune response to TB infection is largely unexplored. To address this issue, here we characterized lncRNA expression profile in primary human B cell response to TB infection using microarray assay. Several lncRNAs and mRNAs were chosen for RT-qPCR validation. Bioinformatics prediction was applied to delineate function of the deregulated mRNAs. We found that 844 lncRNAs and 597 mRNAs were differentially expressed between B cell samples from individuals with or without TB. KEGG pathway analysis for the deregulated mRNAs indicated a number of pathways, such as TB, TLR signaling pathway and antigen processing and presentation. Moreover, corresponding to the dysregulation of many lncRNAs, we also found that their adjacent protein-coding genes were also deregulated. Functional annotation for the corresponding mRNAs showed that these lncRNAs were mainly associated with TLR signaling, TGF-β signaling. Interestingly, SOCS3, which is a critical negative regulator of cytokine response to TB infection and its nearby lncRNA XLOC_012582, were highly expressed in active TB B cells. Subsequent RT-qPCR results confirmed the changes. Whether upregulated XLOC_012582 causes SOCS3 overexpression and is eventually involved in the context of exacerbations of active TB represents an interesting issue that deserves to be further explored. Taken together, for the first time, we identified a set of deregulated lncRNAs in active TB B cells and their functions were predicted. Such findings provided novel insight into the pathogenesis of TB and further studies should focus on the function and pathogenic mechanisms of the lncRNAs involved in active TB.

10.1162/neco_a_01035  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) is aimed at obtaining the low-rank projection matrix in the input space such that information about output data is maximally preserved. Among various approaches to SDR, a promising method is based on the eigendecomposition of the outer product of the gradient of the conditional density of output given input. In this letter, we propose a novel estimator of the gradient of the logarithmic conditional density that directly fits a linear-in-parameter model to the true gradient under the squared loss. Thanks to this simple least-squares formulation, its solution can be computed efficiently in a closed form. Then we develop a new SDR method based on the proposed gradient estimator. We theoretically prove that the proposed gradient estimator, as well as the SDR solution obtained from it, achieves the optimal parametric convergence rate. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that our SDR method compares favorably with existing approaches in both accuracy and computational efficiency on a variety of artificial and benchmark data sets.

10.1159/000477131  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Introduction:  We evaluated bone scan index (BSI) as a predictive biomarker for time to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). 
  Materials and methods:  We identified 85 consecutive mHSPC patients treated with first-line androgen deprivation therapy. We analyzed the correlations between time to CRPC and clinicopathological characteristics, including age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, Gleason score, clinical TNM stage, hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, and BSI. 
  Results:  The median BSI was 2.7%. Progression to CRPC occurred in 55 (64.7%) patients and the median time to CRPC was 12.9 months. In multivariate analysis, 3 significant risk factors for time to CRPC were identified: age (&gt;73 vs. ≤73 years; hazard ratio [HR] 0.53), p = 0.038, PSA level (&gt;270 vs. ≤270 ng/mL; HR 0.53, p = 0.038), and BSI (&gt;2.7 vs. ≤2.7%; HR 2.97, p &lt; 0.001). 
  Conclusion:  Age, PSA level, and BSI were found to be significant predictive factors for time to CRPC in patients with mHSPC.

10.1007/s11596-017-1734-8  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Esophageal cancer is a common malignant tumor, whose pathogenesis and prognosis factors are not fully understood. This study aimed to discover the gene clusters that have similar functions and can be used to predict the prognosis of esophageal cancer. The matched microarray and RNA sequencing data of 185 patients with esophageal cancer were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and gene co-expression networks were built without distinguishing between squamous carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. The result showed that 12 modules were associated with one or more survival data such as recurrence status, recurrence time, vital status or vital time. Furthermore, survival analysis showed that 5 out of the 12 modules were related to progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS). As the most important module, the midnight blue module with 82 genes was related to PFS, apart from the patient age, tumor grade, primary treatment success, and duration of smoking and tumor histological type. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that "glycoprotein binding" was the top enriched function of midnight blue module genes. Additionally, the blue module was the exclusive gene clusters related to OS. Platelet activating factor receptor (PTAFR) and feline Gardner-Rasheed (FGR) were the top hub genes in both modeling datasets and the STRING protein interaction database. In conclusion, our study provides novel insights into the prognosis-associated genes and screens out candidate biomarkers for esophageal cancer.

10.1038/s41598-017-05833-9  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Inactivation of the VHL tumour suppressor gene is a highly frequent genetic event in the carcinogenesis of central nervous system-(CNS) hemangioblastomas (HBs). The patterning of the similar embryonic vasculogenesis is an increasing concern in HB-neovascularization, and the classic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated angiogenesis driven by VHL loss-of-function from human endothelium have been questioned. With this regard, we identify a distinct, VHL silencing-driven mechanism in which human vascular endothelial cells by means of increasing cell proliferation and decreasing cell apoptosis, is concomitant with facilitating accumulation of Twist1 protein in vascular endothelial cells in vitro. Importantly, this molecular mechanism is also pinpointed in CNS-HBs, and associated with the process of HB-neovascularization. In contrast with recent studies of HB-neovascularization, these modified cells did not endow with the typical features of vasculogenesis, indicating that this is a common angiogenesis implementing the formation of the vascular network. Taken together, these findings suggest that vasculogenesis and angiogenesis may constitute complementary mechanisms for HB-neovascularization, and could provide a rational recognition of single anti-angiogenic intervention including targeting to the Twist1 signalling for HBs.

10.1186/s13059-017-1279-y  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Immunometabolism plays a central role in many cardiometabolic diseases. However, a robust map of immune-related gene networks in circulating human cells, their interactions with metabolites, and their genetic control is still lacking. Here, we integrate blood transcriptomic, metabolomic, and genomic profiles from two population-based cohorts (total N = 2168), including a subset of individuals with matched multi-omic data at 7-year follow-up. 
  Results:  We identify topologically replicable gene networks enriched for diverse immune functions including cytotoxicity, viral response, B cell, platelet, neutrophil, and mast cell/basophil activity. These immune gene modules show complex patterns of association with 158 circulating metabolites, including lipoprotein subclasses, lipids, fatty acids, amino acids, small molecules, and CRP. Genome-wide scans for module expression quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) reveal five modules with mQTLs that have both cis and trans effects. The strongest mQTL is in ARHGEF3 (rs1354034) and affects a module enriched for platelet function, independent of platelet counts. Modules of mast cell/basophil and neutrophil function show temporally stable metabolite associations over 7-year follow-up, providing evidence that these modules and their constituent gene products may play central roles in metabolic inflammation. Furthermore, the strongest mQTL in ARHGEF3 also displays clear temporal stability, supporting widespread trans effects at this locus. 
  Conclusions:  This study provides a detailed map of natural variation at the blood immunometabolic interface and its genetic basis, and may facilitate subsequent studies to explain inter-individual variation in cardiometabolic disease.

10.1002/jgm.2936  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous disease and the most common adult leukemia in western countries. IgVH mutational status distinguishes two major types of CLL, each associated with a different prognosis and survival. Sequencing identified NOTCH1 and SF3B1 as the two main recurrent mutations. We described a novel method to clarify how these mutations affect gene expression by finding small-scale signatures that predict the IgVH, NOTCH1 and SF3B1 mutations. We subsequently defined the biological pathways and correlation networks involved in disease development, with the potential goal of identifying new drugable targets. 
  Methods:  We modeled a microarray dataset consisting of 48807 probes derived from 163 samples. The use of Fisher's ratio and fold change combined with feature elimination allowed us to identify the minimum number of genes with the highest predictive mutation power and, subsequently, we applied network and pathway analyses of these genes to identify their biological roles. 
  Results:  The mutational status of the patients was accurately predicted (94-99%) using small-scale gene signatures: 13 genes for IgVH, 60 for NOTCH1 and 22 for SF3B1. LPL plays an important role in the case of the IgVH mutation, whereas MSI2, LTK, TFEC and CNTAP2 are involved in the NOTCH1 mutation, and RPL32 and PLAGL1 are involved in the SF3B1 mutation. Four high discriminatory genes (IGHG1, MYBL1, NRIP1 and RGS1) are common to these three mutations. The IL-4-mediated signaling events pathway appears to be involved as a common mechanism and suggests an important role of the immune response mechanisms and antigen presentation. 
  Conclusions:  This retrospective analysis served to provide a deeper understanding of the effects of the different mutations in CLL disease progression, with the expectation that these findings will be clinically applied in the near future to the development of new drugs.

10.1016/j.beproc.2017.01.012  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The study of canine cognition can be useful in understanding the selective pressures affecting cognitive abilities. Dogs have undergone intensive artificial selection yielding distinctive breeds, which differ both phenotypically and behaviorally and no other species has a wider range in brain size. As brain size has long been hypothesized to relate to cognitive capacity, this species offers a useful model to further explore this relationship. The influence of physical size on canine cognition has not been thoroughly addressed, despite the fact that large dogs are often perceived to be 'smarter' than small dogs. To date, this preconception has only recently been addressed and supported in one study comparing large and small dogs in a social cognition task, where large dogs outperformed small dogs in a pointing choice task. We assessed large and small dogs using a series of spatial cognition tasks and detected no differences between the two groups. Further research is needed to clarify why our results failed to compliment previous findings. It is possible that differences found in social cognition tasks may not be due to differences in size, rather they may be based on other factors such as methodology, prior training experience, or past experience with humans in general.

10.1017/S2045796017000014  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Aims:  Poor recovery from depressive disorder has been shown to be related to low perceived social support and loneliness, but not to social network size or frequency of social interactions. Some studies suggest that the significance of social relationships for depression course may be greater in younger than in older patients, and may differ between men and women. None of the studies examined to what extent the different aspects of social relationships have unique or overlapping predictive values for depression course. It is the aim of the present study to examine the differential predictive values of social network characteristics, social support and loneliness for the course of depressive disorder, and to test whether these predictive associations are modified by gender or age. 
  Methods:  Two naturalistic cohort studies with the same design and overlapping instruments were combined to obtain a study sample of 1474 patients with a major depressive disorder, of whom 1181 (80.1%) could be studied over a 2-year period. Social relational variables were assessed at baseline. Two aspects of depression course were studied: remission at 2-year follow-up and change in depression severity over the follow-up period. By means of logistic regression and random coefficient analysis, the individual and combined predictive values of the different social relational variables for depression course were studied, controlling for potential confounders and checking for effect modification by age (below 60 v. 60 years or older) and gender. 
  Results:  Multiple aspects of the social network, social support and loneliness were related to depression course, independent of potential confounders - including depression severity - but when combined, their predictive values were found to overlap to a large extent. Only the social network characteristic of living in a larger household, the social support characteristic of few negative experiences with the support from a partner or close friend, and limited feelings of loneliness proved to have unique predictive value for a favourable course of depression. Little evidence was found for effect modification by gender or age. 
  Conclusions:  If depressed persons experience difficulties in their social relationships, this may impede their recovery. Special attention for interpersonal problems, social isolation and feelings of loneliness seems warranted in depression treatment and relapse prevention. It will be of great interest to test whether social relational interventions can contribute to better recovery and relapse prevention of depressive disorder.

10.3390/s17092109  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Collision avoidance is an important feature in advanced driver-assistance systems, aimed at providing correct, timely and reliable warnings before an imminent collision (with objects, vehicles, pedestrians, etc.). The obstacle recognition library is designed and implemented to address the design and evaluation of obstacle detection in a transportation cyber-physical system. The library is integrated into a co-simulation framework that is supported on the interaction between SCANeR software and Matlab/Simulink. From the best of the authors' knowledge, two main contributions are reported in this paper. Firstly, the modelling and simulation of virtual on-chip light detection and ranging sensors in a cyber-physical system, for traffic scenarios, is presented. The cyber-physical system is designed and implemented in SCANeR. Secondly, three specific artificial intelligence-based methods for obstacle recognition libraries are also designed and applied using a sensory information database provided by SCANeR. The computational library has three methods for obstacle detection: a multi-layer perceptron neural network, a self-organization map and a support vector machine. Finally, a comparison among these methods under different weather conditions is presented, with very promising results in terms of accuracy. The best results are achieved using the multi-layer perceptron in sunny and foggy conditions, the support vector machine in rainy conditions and the self-organized map in snowy conditions.

10.1038/s41598-017-13712-6  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Subtelomeric macrosatellite repeats are difficult to sequence using conventional sequencing methods owing to the high similarity among repeat units and high GC content. Sequencing these repetitive regions is challenging, even with recent improvements in sequencing technologies. Among these repeats, a haplotype carrying a particular sequence and shortening of the D4Z4 array on human chromosome 4q35 causes one of the most prevalent forms of muscular dystrophy with autosomal-dominant inheritance, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). Here, we applied a nanopore-based ultra-long read sequencer to sequence a BAC clone containing 13 D4Z4 repeats and flanking regions. We successfully obtained the whole D4Z4 repeat sequence, including the pathogenic gene DUX4 in the last D4Z4 repeat. The estimated sequence accuracy of the total repeat region was 99.8% based on a comparison with the reference sequence. Errors were typically observed between purine or between pyrimidine bases. Further, we analyzed the D4Z4 sequence from publicly available ultra-long whole human genome sequencing data obtained by nanopore sequencing. This technology may be a new tool for studying D4Z4 repeats and pathomechanism of FSHD in the future and has the potential to widen our understanding of subtelomeric regions.

10.1107/S2053230X17004782  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Cytochromes P450 (P450s) are haem-containing enzymes that catalyze medically and industrially important oxidative reactions, and many P450s have been subjected to directed evolution and site-directed mutagenesis to improve their activity and substrate specificity. Nonetheless, in most cases the mechanism that leads to drastic changes in specific activity after the introduction of an amino-acid substitution distant from the active-site pocket is unclear. Here, two crystal structures of inactive mutants of the P450 vitamin D<sub>3</sub> hydroxylase (Vdh), Vdh-F106V and Vdh-L348M, which were obtained in the course of protein-engineering experiments on Vdh, are reported. The overall structures of these mutants show an open conformation similar to that of wild-type Vdh (Vdh-WT), whereas a rearrangement of the common main-chain hydrogen bonds is observed in the CD-loop (residues 102-106), resulting in a more compactly folded CD-loop relative to that of Vdh-WT. The previously reported structures of Vdh-WT and of the highly active Vdh-T107A and Vdh-K1 mutants have a more stretched CD-loop, with partial formation of 3<sub>10</sub>-helix-type hydrogen bonds, both in the open and closed states. Molecular-dynamics simulations also showed that the frequency of the 3<sub>10</sub>-helix is significantly reduced in Vdh-F106V and Vdh-L348M. The closed conformation is crucial for substrate and ferredoxin binding to initiate the catalytic reaction of Vdh. Therefore, it is implied that the small local structural changes observed in this study might disrupt the conformational transition from the open to the closed state, thereby leading to a complete loss of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> hydroxylase activity.

10.1007/s00198-016-3825-y  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   In male Caucasians with discordant hip bone mineral density (BMD), we applied the subcellular separation and proteome profiling to investigate the monocytic cytosol. Three BMD-associated proteins (ALDOA, MYH14, and Rap1B) were identified based on multiple omics evidence, and they may influence the pathogenic mechanisms of osteoporosis by regulating the activities of monocytes. 
  Introduction:  Osteoporosis is a serious public health problem, leading to significant mortality not only in aging females but also in males. Peripheral blood monocytes (PBMs) play important roles in bone metabolism by acting as precursors of osteoclasts and producing cytokines important for osteoclast development. The first cytosolic sub-proteome profiling analysis was performed in male PBMs to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) that are associated with BMDs and risk of osteoporosis. 
  Methods:  Here, we conducted a comparative proteomics analysis in PBMs from Caucasian male subjects with discordant hip BMD (29 low BMD vs. 30 high BMD). To decrease the proteome complexity and expand the coverage range of the cellular proteome, we separated the PBM proteome into several subcellular compartments and focused on the cytosolic fractions, which are involved in a wide range of fundamental biochemical processes. 
  Results:  Of the total of 3796 detected cytosolic proteins, we identified 16 significant (P &lt; 0.05) and an additional 22 suggestive (P &lt; 0.1) DEPs between samples with low vs. high hip BMDs. Some of the genes for DEPs, including ALDOA, MYH14, and Rap1B, showed an association with BMD in multiple omics studies (proteomic, transcriptomic, and genomic). Further bioinformatics analysis revealed the enrichment of DEPs in functional terms for monocyte proliferation, differentiation, and migration. 
  Conclusions:  The combination strategy of subcellular separation and proteome profiling allows an in-depth and refined investigation into the composition and functions of cytosolic proteome, which may shed light on the monocyte-mediated pathogenic mechanisms of osteoporosis.

10.1177/1745691617727529  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   In response to our article, Davidson and Dahl offer commentary and advice regarding additional topics crucial to a comprehensive prescriptive agenda for future research on mindfulness and meditation. Their commentary raises further challenges and provides an important complement to our article. More consideration of these issues is especially welcome because limited space precluded us from addressing all relevant topics. While we agree with many of Davidson and Dahl's suggestions, the present reply (a) highlights reasons why the concerns we expressed are still especially germane to mindfulness and meditation research (even though those concerns may not be entirely unique) and (b) gives more context to other issues posed by them. We discuss special characteristics of individuals who participate in mindfulness and meditation research and focus on the vulnerability of this field inherent in its relative youthfulness compared to other more mature scientific disciplines. Moreover, our reply highlights the serious consequences of adverse experiences suffered by a significant subset of individuals during mindfulness and other contemplative practices. We also scrutinize common contemporary applications of mindfulness and meditation to illness, and some caveats are introduced regarding mobile technologies for guidance of contemplative practices.

10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b00955  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Pre-eclampsia is a hypertensive disorder characterized by the new onset of hypertension &gt;140/90 mmHg and proteinuria after the 20th week of gestation. The disorder is multifactorial and originates with abnormal placentation. Comparison of the placental proteome of normotensive (n = 25) and pre-eclamptic (n = 25) patients by gel-free proteomic techniques identified a total of 2145 proteins in the placenta of which 180 were differentially expressed (&gt;1.3 fold, p &lt; 0.05). Gene ontology enrichment analysis of biological process suggested that the differentially expressed proteins belonged to various physiological processes such as angiogenesis, apoptosis, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and placental development, which are implicated in the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia. Some of the differentially expressed proteins were monitored in the plasma by multiple reaction monitoring analysis, which showed an increase in apolipoproteins A-I and A-II in gestational weeks 26-30 (2-fold, p &lt; 0.01), while haptoglobin and hemopexin decreased in gestational weeks 26-30 and week 40/at delivery (1.8 fold, p &lt; 0.01) in pre-eclamptic patients. This study provides a proteomic insight into the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia. Identified candidate proteins can be evaluated further for the development of potential biomarkers associated with pre-eclampsia pathogenesis.

10.1007/s13365-017-0586-0  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   HIV-1 Nef is a flexible, multifunctional protein with several cellular targets that is required for pathogenicity of the virus. This protein maintains a high degree of genetic variation among intra- and inter-host isolates. HIV Nef is relevant to HIV-associated neurological diseases (HAND) in patients treated with combined antiretroviral therapy because of the protein's role in promoting survival and migration of infected brain macrophages. In this study, we analyzed 2020 HIV Nef sequences derived from 22 different tissues and 31 subjects using a novel computational approach. This approach combines statistical regression and evolved neural networks (ENNs) to classify brain sequences based on the physical and chemical characteristics of functional Nef domains. Based on training, testing, and validation data, the method successfully classified brain Nef sequences at 84.5% and provided informative features for further examination. These included physicochemical features associated with the Src-homology-3 binding domain, the Nef loop (including the AP-2 Binding region), and a cytokine-binding domain. Non-brain sequences from patients with HIV-associated neurological disease were frequently classified as brain, suggesting that the approach could indicate neurological risk using blood-derived virus or for the development of biomarkers for use in assay systems aimed at drug efficacy studies for the treatment of HIV-associated neurological diseases.

10.1111/bcpt.12914  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Schisantherin A and schisandrin A, the most abundant active ingredients of Wuzhi capsule, are known to inhibit tacrolimus metabolism by inhibiting CYP3A4/5. We aimed to predict the contribution of schisantherin A and schisandrin A to drug-drug interaction (DDI) between Wuzhi capsule and tacrolimus using physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling. Firstly, the inhibition mechanism of schisantherin A and schisandrin A on CYP3A4/5 was investigated. Thereafter, PBPK models of schisantherin A, schisandrin A and tacrolimus were established. Finally, tacrolimus pharmacokinetics were evaluated after the combined use with schisantherin A or schisandrin A. The blood area under the curve (AUC) of tacrolimus increased 1.77- and 2.61-fold after a single dose and multiple doses of schisantherin A, respectively. Meanwhile, schisandrin A inhibited tacrolimus metabolism to a smaller extent. Also, it showed that mechanism-based inhibition (MBI) played a more important role in DDI than reversible inhibition after long-term administration, while reversible inhibition was comparable to MBI after single-dose administration. In conclusion, we utilized PBPK modelling to quantify the contribution of schisantherin A and schisandrin A to DDI between tacrolimus and Wuzhi capsule. This may provide more insights for the rational use of this drug combination.

A total of 81 differentially expressed miRNAs belonging to 29 families and 8133 mRNAs were identified. The Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses showed that genes encoding the DNA/RNA binding, catalytic activity and signalling molecules were all significantly enriched. Moreover, 88 miRNA-mRNA interaction pairs were identified through a combined analysis of the two datasets. We also found evidence showing that the virus-derived siRNAs (vsiRNAs) from the PVY genome target tobacco translationally controlled tumor protein (NtTCTP) mRNA and mediate plant resistance to PVY. Together, our findings revealed that both miRNA and mRNA expression patterns can be changed in response to PVY infection and novel vsiRNA-plant interactions that may regulate plant resistance to PVY. Both provide fresh insights into the virus-plant interactions.

10.3892/mmr.2017.8368  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The present study aimed to elucidate the potential mechanism of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) in neuroblastoma progression and to identify the candidate genes associated with neuroblastoma with CDK2 silencing. The microarray data of GSE16480 were obtained from the gene expression omnibus database. This dataset contained 15 samples: Neuroblastoma cell line IMR32 transfected with CDK2 shRNA at 0, 8, 24, 48 and 72 h (n=3 per group; total=15). Significant clusters associated with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using fuzzy C‑Means algorithm in the Mfuzz package. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs in each cluster were performed, and a protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. Additionally, functional annotation of DEGs in clusters was performed for the detection of transcription factors and tumor‑associated genes. A total of 4 clusters with significant change tendency and 1,683 DEGs were identified. The hub nodes of the PPI network constructed by DEGs in Cluster 1, Cluster 2, Cluster 3 and Cluster 4 were MDM2 oncogene, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (MDM2), cyclin‑dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), proteasome (prosome, macropain) 26S subunit, non‑ATPase, 14 (PSMD14) and translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO) respectively. These genes were significantly enriched in the p53 signaling pathway, cell cycle, proteasome and systemic lupus erythematosus pathways. MDM2, CDK1, PSMD14 and TSPO may be key target genes of CDK2. CDK2 may have key functions in neuroblastoma progression by regulating the expression of these genes.

10.3892/mmr.2017.8318  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Although alterations in microRNA (miRNA) expression have been previously investigated prostate cancer, the expression of miRNAs specifically in benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) of the prostatic stroma remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, miRNAs and gene expression profiles were investigated using microarray analysis and reverse transcription quantitative‑polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) in BPH tissue to clarify the associations between miRNA expression and target genes. Prostate tissue samples from five patients with BPH and five healthy men were analyzed using human Affymetrix miRNA and mRNA microarrays and differentially expressed miRNAs were validated using RT‑qPCR with 30 BPH and 5 healthy control samples. A total of 8 miRNAs, including miRNA (miR)‑96‑5p, miR‑1271‑5p, miR‑21‑3p, miR‑96‑5p, miR‑181a‑5p, miR‑143‑3p, miR‑4428 and miR‑106a‑5p were upregulated and 8 miRNAs (miR‑16‑5p, miR‑19b‑5p, miR‑940, miR‑25, miR‑486‑3p, miR‑30a‑3p, let‑7c and miR‑191) were downregulated. Additionally, miR‑96‑5p was demonstrated to have an inhibitory effect on the mRNA expression levels of the following genes: Mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR), RPTOR independent companion of MTOR complex 2, syntaxin 10, autophagy‑related protein 9A, zinc finger E‑box binding homeobox 1, caspase 2 and protein kinase c ε. Additionally, 16 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified using RT‑qPCR analysis. This preliminary study provides a solid basis for a further functional study to investigate the underlying regulatory mechanisms of BPH.

10.1016/j.meegid.2017.01.029  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Bluetongue virus (BTV) is a member of the genus Orbivirus within the family Reoviridae and causes a non-contagious, insect-transmitted disease in domestic and wild ruminants, mainly in sheep and occasionally in cattle and some species of deer. Virus infection can trigger the changes of the cellular microRNA (miRNA) expression profile, which play important post-transcriptional regulatory roles in gene expression and can greatly influence viral replication and pathogenesis. Here, we employed deep sequencing technology to determine which cellular miRNAs were differentially expressed in primary sheep testicular (ST) cells infected with BTV. A total of 25 known miRNAs and 240 novel miRNA candidates that were differentially expressed in BTV-infected and uninfected ST cells were identified, and 251 and 8428 predicted target genes were annotated, respectively. Nine differentially expressed miRNAs and their mRNA targets were validated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Targets prediction and functional analysis of these regulated miRNAs revealed significant enrichment for several signaling pathways including MAPK, PI3K-Akt, endocytosis, Hippo, NF-kB, viral carcinogenesis, FoxO, and JAK-STAT signaling pathways. This study provides a valuable basis for further investigation on the roles of miRNAs in BTV replication and pathogenesis.

10.1016/j.compbiomed.2017.09.013  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Electromyogram pattern recognition (EMG-PR) based control for upper-limb prostheses conventionally focuses on the classification of signals acquired in a controlled laboratory setting. In such a setting, relatively stable and high performances are often reported because subjects could consistently perform muscle contractions corresponding to a targeted limb motion. Meanwhile the clinical implementation of EMG-PR method is characterized by degradations in stability and classification performances due to the disparities between the constrained laboratory setting and clinical use. One of such disparities is the mobility of subject that would cause changes in the EMG signal patterns when eliciting identical limb motions in mobile scenarios. In this study, the effect of mobility on the performance of EMG-PR motion classifier was firstly investigated based on myoelectric and accelerometer signals acquired from six upper-limb amputees across four scenarios. Secondly, three methods were proposed to mitigate such effect on the EMG-PR motion classifier. From the obtained results, an average classification error (CE) of 9.50% (intra-scenario) was achieved when data from the same scenarios were used to train and test the EMG-PR classifier, while the CE increased to 18.48% (inter-scenario) when trained and tested with dataset from different scenarios. This implies that mobility would significantly lead to about 8.98% increase of classification error (p &lt; 0.05). By applying the proposed methods, the degradation in classification performance was significantly reduced from 8.98% to 1.86% (Dual-stage sequential method), 3.17% (Hybrid strategy), and 4.64% (Multi-scenario strategy). Hence, the proposed methods may potentially improve the clinical robustness of the currently available multifunctional prostheses. 
  Trial registration:  The study was approved by the ethics committee of Institutional Review Board of Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, and the reference number is SIAT-IRB-150515-H0077.

10.1080/15376516.2017.1388460  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Metastasis is the major hindrance in the treatment of all cancers, including laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Intensive researches are under way to identify the effective natural polyphenols with anti-metastatic ability for cancer treatment. Wheatgrass, an herbal plant has been reported to show anticancer effects. Hence, in this study, we aimed to analyze the anti-metastatic effect of methanol extract of wheatgrass (MEWG). The levels of metastatic marker proteins were determined by western blot. PI3K and AKT levels were determined by real time (RT)-PCR analysis. In silico molecular docking was done to check the interaction of the 14 components (identified by HPLC/GCMS) of MEWG with PI3K and AKT. MEWG effectively decreased the metastatic protein expressions, namely VEGF, MMP-9 and COX-2 and increased TIMP-2. RT-PCR results showed reduced m-RNA levels of both PI3K and AKT when compared to control. Molecular docking studies revealed interaction of most of the identified compounds of the extract with the important residues of PI3K and AKT. These findings indicate that MEWG inhibits metastasis and angiogenesis in Hep-2 cells possibly via PI3K/AKT due to the cumulative effect of polyphenols and other constituent present in extract. The compounds of the extract were also found to be directly involved in inhibition of AKT/PI3K, thus could help to restrain metastasis.

Of these, SHOX abnormalities are known to account for a certain percentage of ISS cases, whereas the frequency of mutations in the other 10 genes in ISS cohorts remains unknown. Here, we performed next-generation sequencing-based mutation screening of the 10 genes in 86 unrelated Japanese ISS patients without SHOX abnormalities. We searched for rare protein-altering variants. The functional significance of the identified variants was assessed by in silico analyses. Consequently, we identified 18 heterozygous rare variants in 19 patients, including four probable damaging variants in ACAN, six pathogenicity-unknown variants in FGFR3, GHRHR, GHR, and IGFALS, and eight possible benign variants. Pathogenic variants in NPR2, GH1, and IGF1 were absent from our cohort. Unlike previously reported patients with ACAN mutations, our four patients with ACAN variants manifested non-specific short stature with age-appropriate or mildly delayed bone ages, and had parents of normal stature. These results indicate that ACAN mutations can underlie ISS without characteristic skeletal features, and that such mutations are possibly associated with de novo occurrence or low penetrance. In addition, our data imply that mutations in FGFR3, NPR2, and GH-IGF1 axis genes play only limited roles in the etiology of ISS.

10.3389/fnins.2017.00324  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   An ongoing challenge in neuromorphic computing is to devise general and computationally efficient models of inference and learning which are compatible with the spatial and temporal constraints of the brain. One increasingly popular and successful approach is to take inspiration from inference and learning algorithms used in deep neural networks. However, the workhorse of deep learning, the gradient descent Gradient Back Propagation (BP) rule, often relies on the immediate availability of network-wide information stored with high-precision memory during learning, and precise operations that are difficult to realize in neuromorphic hardware. Remarkably, recent work showed that exact backpropagated gradients are not essential for learning deep representations. Building on these results, we demonstrate an event-driven random BP (eRBP) rule that uses an error-modulated synaptic plasticity for learning deep representations. Using a two-compartment Leaky Integrate &amp; Fire (I&amp;F) neuron, the rule requires only one addition and two comparisons for each synaptic weight, making it very suitable for implementation in digital or mixed-signal neuromorphic hardware. Our results show that using eRBP, deep representations are rapidly learned, achieving classification accuracies on permutation invariant datasets comparable to those obtained in artificial neural network simulations on GPUs, while being robust to neural and synaptic state quantizations during learning.

The automatic segmentation of SR-µCT scans is highly valuable due to its innumerous applications in geological sciences, especially for morphology, typology, and characterization of rocks. For a great number of µCT scan slices, a manual process of segmentation would be impractical, either for the time expended and for the accuracy of results. Aiming the automatic segmentation of SR-µCT geological sample images, we applied and compared Energy Minimization via Graph Cuts (GC) algorithms and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), as well as the well-known K-means and Fuzzy C-Means algorithms. The Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Sensitivity and Precision were the metrics used for comparison. Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's tests were applied and the best methods were the GC algorithms and ANNs (with Levenberg-Marquardt and Bayesian Regularization). For those algorithms, an approximate Dice Similarity Coefficient of 95% was achieved. Our results confirm the possibility of usage of those algorithms for segmentation and posterior quantification of porosity of an igneous rock sample SR-µCT scan.

No systematic review has addressed the effect of isoenergetic fructose replacement of other sugars and its effect on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose, insulin, and triglycerides.<b>Objective:</b> The objective of this study was to review the evidence for a reduction in fasting glycemic and insulinemic markers after chronic, isoenergetic replacement of glucose or sucrose in foods or beverages by fructose. The target populations were persons without diabetes, those with impaired glucose tolerance, and those with type 2 diabetes.<b>Design:</b> We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal, and clinicaltrials.gov The date of the last search was 26 April 2016. We included randomized controlled trials of isoenergetic replacement of glucose, sucrose, or both by fructose in adults or children with or without diabetes of ≥2 wk duration that measured fasting blood glucose. The main outcomes analyzed were fasting blood glucose and insulin as well as fasting triglycerides, blood lipoproteins, HbA1c, and body weight.<b>Results:</b> We included 14 comparison arms from 11 trials, including 277 patients. The studies varied in length from 2 to 10 wk (mean: 28 d) and included doses of fructose between 40 and 150 g/d (mean: 68 g/d). Fructose substitution in some subgroups resulted in significantly but only slightly lowered fasting blood glucose (-0.14 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.24, -0.036 mmol/L), HbA1c [-10 g/L (95% CI: -12.90, -7.10 g/L; impaired glucose tolerance) and -6 g/L (95% CI: -8.47, -3.53 g/L; normoglycemia)], triglycerides (-0.08 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.14, -0.02 mmol/L), and body weight (-1.40 kg; 95% CI: -2.07, -0.74 kg). There was no effect on fasting blood insulin or blood lipids.<b>Conclusions:</b> The evidence suggests that the substitution of fructose for glucose or sucrose in food or beverages may be of benefit to individuals, particularly those with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes. However, additional high-quality studies in these populations are required.

10.2196/resprot.8085  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Adaptive e-learning environments (AEEs) can provide tailored instruction by adapting content, navigation, presentation, multimedia, and tools to each user's navigation behavior, individual objectives, knowledge, and preferences. AEEs can have various levels of complexity, ranging from systems using a simple adaptive functionality to systems using artificial intelligence. While AEEs are promising, their effectiveness for the education of health professionals and health professions students remains unclear. 
  Objective:  The purpose of this systematic review is to assess the effectiveness of AEEs in improving knowledge, competence, and behavior in health professionals and students. 
  Methods:  We will follow the Cochrane Collaboration and the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group guidelines on systematic review methodology. A systematic search of the literature will be conducted in 6 bibliographic databases (CINAHL, EMBASE, ERIC, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science) using the concepts "adaptive e-learning environments," "health professionals/students," and "effects on knowledge/skills/behavior." We will include randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials, in addition to controlled before-after, interrupted time series, and repeated measures studies published between 2005 and 2017. The title and the abstract of each study followed by a full-text assessment of potentially eligible studies will be independently screened by 2 review authors. Using the EPOC extraction form, 1 review author will conduct data extraction and a second author will validate the data extraction. The methodological quality of included studies will be independently assessed by 2 review authors using the EPOC risk of bias criteria. Included studies will be synthesized by a descriptive analysis. Where appropriate, data will be pooled using meta-analysis by applying the RevMan software version 5.1, considering the heterogeneity of studies. 
  Results:  The review is in progress. We plan to submit the results in the beginning of 2018. 
  Conclusion:  Providing tailored instruction to health professionals and students is a priority in order to optimize learning and clinical outcomes. This systematic review will synthesize the best available evidence regarding the effectiveness of AEEs in improving knowledge, competence, and behavior in health professionals and students. It will provide guidance to policy makers, hospital managers, and researchers in terms of AEE development, implementation, and evaluation in health care.

10.2196/jmir.6983  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  The daily commute could be a right moment to teach drivers to use movement or breath towards improving their mental health. Long commutes, the relevance of transitioning from home to work, and vice versa and the privacy of commuting by car make the commute an ideal scenario and time to perform mindful exercises safely. Whereas driving safety is paramount, mindful exercises might help commuters decrease their daily stress while staying alert. Increasing vehicle automation may present new opportunities but also new challenges. 
  Objective:  This study aimed to explore the design space for movement-based mindful interventions for commuters. We used qualitative analysis of simulated driving experiences in combination with simple movements to obtain key design insights. 
  Methods:  We performed a semistructured viability assessment in 2 parts. First, a think-aloud technique was used to obtain information about a driving task. Drivers (N=12) were given simple instructions to complete movements (configural or breath-based) while engaged in either simple (highway) or complex (city) simulated urban driving tasks using autonomous and manual driving modes. Then, we performed a matching exercise where participants could experience vibrotactile patterns from the back of the car seat and map them to the prior movements. 
  Results:  We report a summary of individual perceptions concerning different movements and vibrotactile patterns. Beside describing situations within a drive when it may be more likely to perform movement-based interventions, we also describe movements that may interfere with driving and those that may complement it well. Furthermore, we identify movements that could be conducive to a more relaxing commute and describe vibrotactile patterns that could guide such movements and exercises. We discuss implications for design such as the influence of driving modality on the adoption of movement, need for personal customization, the influence that social perception has on participants, and the potential role of prior awareness of mindful techniques in the adoption of new movement-based interventions. 
  Conclusions:  This exploratory study provides insights into which types of movements could be better suited to design mindful interventions to reduce stress for commuters, when to encourage such movements, and how best to guide them using noninvasive haptic stimuli embedded in the car seat.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.07.019  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Population-level inferences and individual-level analyses are two important aspects in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. Extracting reliable and informative features from fMRI data that capture biologically meaningful inter-subject variation is critical for aligning and comparing functional networks across subjects, and connecting the properties of functional brain organization with variations in behavior, cognition and genetics. In this study, we derive two new measures, which we term functional density map and edge map, and demonstrate their usefulness in characterizing the function of individual brains. Specifically, using data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we show that (1) both functional maps capture intrinsic properties of the functional connectivity pattern in individuals while exhibiting large variation across subjects; (2) functional maps derived from either resting-state or task-evoked fMRI can be used to accurately identify subjects from a population; and (3) cross-subject alignment using these functional maps considerably reduces functional variation and improves functional correspondence across subjects over state-of-the-art multimodal registration algorithms. Our results suggest that the proposed functional density and edge maps are promising features in characterizing the functional architecture in individuals and provide an alternative way to explore the functional variation across subjects.

10.1371/journal.pone.0172290  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Knowledge about the arrangement of visual elements is an important aspect of perception. This study investigates whether humans learn rules of two-dimensional abstract patterns (exemplars) generated from Reber's artificial grammar. The key question is whether the subjects can implicitly learn them without explicit instructions, and, if so, how they use the acquired knowledge to judge new patterns (probes) in relation to their finite experience of the exemplars. The analysis was conducted using dissimilarities among patterns, which are defined with n-gram probabilities and the Levenshtein distance. The results show that subjects are able to learn rules of two-dimensional visual patterns (exemplars) and make categorical judgment of probes based on knowledge of exemplar-based representation. Our analysis revealed that subjects' judgments of probes were related to the degree of dissimilarities between the probes and exemplars. The result suggests the coexistence of configural and element-based processing in exemplar-based representations. Exemplar-based representation was preferred to prototypical representation through tasks requiring discrimination, recognition and working memory. Relations of the studied judgment processes to the neural basis are discussed. We conclude that knowledge of a finite experience of two-dimensional visual patterns would be crystalized in different levels of relations among visual elements.

Here, we used LC-MS/MS to identify HLA-DR-presented self-peptides in cells taken directly from clinical samples: ST, synovial fluid mononuclear cells (SFMC), or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from five patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and eight with Lyme arthritis (LA). We identified 1593 non-redundant HLA-DR-presented peptides, derived from 870 source proteins. A total of 67% of the peptides identified in SFMC and 55% of those found in PBMC were found in ST, but analysis of SFMC/PBMC also revealed new antigen-presented peptides. Peptides were synthesized and examined for reactivity with the patients' PBMC. To date, three autoantigens in RA and four novel autoantigens in LA, presented in ST and/or PBMC, were shown to be targets of T- and B-cell responses in these diseases; ongoing analyses may add to this list. Thus, immunoprecipitation and LC-MS/MS can now identify hundreds of HLA-DR-presented self-peptides from individual patients' tissues or fluids with mixed cell populations. Importantly, identification of HLA-DR-presented peptides from SFMC or PBMC allows testing of more patients, including those early in the disease. Direct analysis of clinical samples facilitates identification of novel immunogenic T-cell epitopes.

10.3892/mmr.2017.7349  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Osteosarcoma is the most common type of primary bone cancer in children and young adults. The prognosis of osteosarcoma is very poor when it is diagnosed with metastasis. Lysosomal‑associated membrane protein 3 (LAMP3) is a tumor‑specific protein induced by hypoxia, which stimulates invasion and metastasis of various cancer cells via hypoxia‑inducible factor (HIF). A previous study from our group has reported that expression of LAMP3 is significantly increased in lung metastatic osteosarcoma compared with primary osteosarcoma using microarray analysis, suggesting that LAMP3 may be involved in metastatic osteosarcoma. The present study therefore aimed to investigate the role of LAMP3 in osteosarcoma metastasis. Knockdown of LAMP3 decreased the invasion of two osteosarcoma cell lines in vitro. Furthermore, knockdown of LAMP3 increased the expression of secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), cadherin 1, and keratin 19, while it decreased the expression of matrix metallopeptidase 2, collagen type III α 1, twist family bHLH transcription factor 1 and cadherin 2. Concurrent knockdown of SPP1 and LAMP3 attenuated the changes in gene expression profile induced by LAMP3 knockdown alone. Gene ontology and KEGG analysis demonstrated that SPP1 was involved in cell adhesion, focal adhesion, and extracellular matrix‑receptor interaction. In conclusion, the present results suggest that LAMP3 may be involved in the invasion and metastasis of osteosarcoma via regulating signaling downstream of SPP1. Thus, LAMP3/SPP1 signaling may serve as a potential target in the future to prevent osteosarcoma metastasis.

10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b00658  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Classical galactosemia, a hereditary metabolic disease caused by the deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT; EC 2.7.712), results in an impaired galactose metabolism and serious long-term developmental affection of the CNS and ovaries, potentially related in part to endogenous galactose-induced protein dysglycosylation. In search for galactose-induced changes in membrane raft proteomes of GALT-deficient cells, we performed differential analyses of lipid rafts from patient-derived (Q) and sex- and age-matched control fibroblasts (H) in the presence or absence of the stressor. Label-based proteomics revealed of the total 454 (female) or 678 (male) proteins a proportion of ∼12% in at least one of four relevant ratios as fold-changed. GALT(-) cell-specific effects in the absence of stressor revealed cell-model-dependent affection of biological processes related to protein targeting to the plasma membrane (female) or to cellular migration (male). However, a series of common galactose-induced effects were observed, among them the strongly increased ER-stress marker GRP78 and calreticulin involved in N-glycoprotein quality control. The membrane-anchored N-glycoprotein receptor CD109 was concertedly decreased under galactose-stress together with cadherin-13, GLIPR1, glypican-1, and semaphorin-7A. A series of proteins showed opposite fold-changes in the two cell models, whereas others fluctuated in only one of the two models.

10.1098/rsif.2017.0134  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Animals using adhesive pads to climb smooth surfaces face the problem of keeping their pads clean and functional. Here, a self-cleaning mechanism is proposed whereby soiled feet would slip on the surface due to a lack of adhesion but shed particles in return. Our study offers an <i>in situ</i> quantification of self-cleaning performance in fibrillar adhesives, using the dock beetle as a model organism. After beetles soiled their pads by stepping into patches of spherical beads, we found that their gait was significantly affected. Specifically, soiled pads slipped 10 times further than clean pads, with more particles deposited for longer slips. Like previous studies, we found that particle size affected cleaning performance. Large (45 μm) beads were removed most effectively, followed by medium (10 μm) and small (1 μm). Consistent with our results from climbing beetles, force measurements on freshly severed legs revealed larger detachment forces of medium particles from adhesive pads compared to a flat surface, possibly due to interlocking between fibres. By contrast, dock leaves showed an overall larger affinity to the beads and thus reduced the need for cleaning. Self-cleaning through slippage provides a mechanism robust to particle size and may inspire solutions for artificial adhesives.

10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2017.12.016  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Student participation and the use of active methodologies in classroom learning are being increasingly emphasized. The use of intelligent systems can be of great help when designing and developing these types of activities. Recently, emerging disciplines such as 'educational data mining' and 'learning analytics and knowledge' have provided clear examples of the importance of the use of artificial intelligence techniques in education. 
  Objective:  The main objective of this study was to gather expert opinions regarding the benefits of using complementary methods that are supported by intelligent systems, specifically, by intelligent information access systems, when processing texts written in natural language and the benefits of using these methods as companion tools to the learning activities that are employed by biomedical and health sciences teachers. 
  Methods:  Eleven teachers of degree courses who belonged to the Faculties of Biomedical Sciences (BS) and Health Sciences (HS) of a Spanish university in Madrid were individually interviewed. These interviews were conducted using a mixed methods questionnaire that included 66 predefined close-ended and open-ended questions. In our study, three intelligent information access systems (i.e., BioAnnote, CLEiM and MedCMap) were successfully used to evaluate the teacher's perceptions regarding the utility of these systems and their different methods in learning activities. 
  Results:  All teachers reported using active learning methods in the classroom, most of which were computer programs that were used for initially designing and later executing learning activities. All teachers used case-based learning methods in the classroom, with a specific emphasis on case reports written in Spanish and/or English. In general, few or none of the teachers were familiar with the technical terms related to the technologies used for these activities such as "intelligent systems" or "concept/mental maps". However, they clearly realized the potential applicability of such approaches in both the preparation and the effective use of these activities in the classroom. Specifically, the themes highlighted by a greater number of teachers after analyzing the responses to the open-ended questions were the usefulness of BioAnnote system to provide reliable sources of medical information and the usefulness of the bilingual nature of CLEiM system for learning medical terminology in English. 
  Conclusions:  Three intelligent information access systems were successfully used to evaluate the teacher's perceptions regarding the utility of these systems in learning activities. The results of this study showed that integration of reliable sources of information, bilingualism and selective annotation of concepts were the most valued features by the teachers, who also considered the incorporation of these systems into learning activities to be potentially very useful. In addition, in the context of our experimental conditions, our work provides useful insights into the way to appropriately integrate this type of intelligent information access systems into learning activities, revealing key themes to consider when developing such approaches.

10.3892/ijmm.2017.3086  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The degradation of cruciate ligaments is frequently observed in degenerative joint diseases, such as osteo-arthritis (OA). The present study aimed to identify the differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) in knee anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tissues derived from patients with OA and in health subjects (non-OA). By using Affymetrix miRNA 4.0 microarrays, a total of 22 miRNAs (including let-7f-5p, miR-26b-5p and miR-146a-5p) were found to be upregulated, while 17 (including miR-18a-3p, miR-138-5p and miR-485-3p) were downregulated in the osteoarthritic ACL tissues (fold change ≥2, P-value &lt;0.05). The expression levels of 12 miRNAs were validated by quantitative PCR, and the corresponding results revealed an excellent correlation with the microarray data (R2=0.889). Genes (such as a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain with thrombospondin type-1 motifs, bone morphogenetic protein-2, runt related transcription factor-2, collagen-1A1 and 2, interleukin-6 and transforming growth factor-β) involved in cartilage development and remodeling, collagen biosynthesis and degradation, inflammatory response and extracellular matrix homeostasis were predicted as potential targets of the dysregulated miRNAs. Moreover, a large set of putative genes were enriched in OA pathogenesis‑associated pathways (such as mitogen-activated protein kinase and vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway). Collectively, the data from our study provides novel insight into the ligament injury-related miRNA dysregulation in patients with OA.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.10.010  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Sulcal morphology has been reported to change with age-related neurological diseases, but the trajectories of sulcal change in normal ageing in the elderly is still unclear. We conducted a study of sulcal morphological changes over seven years in 132 normal elderly participants aged 70-90 years at baseline, and who remained cognitively normal for the next seven years. We examined the fold opening and sulcal depth of sixteen (eight on each hemisphere) prominent sulci based on T1-weighted MRI using automated methods with visual quality control. The trajectory of each individual sulcus with respect to age was examined separately by linear mixed models. Fold opening was best modelled by cubic fits in five sulci, by quadratic models in six sulci and by linear models in five sulci, indicating an accelerated widening of a number of sulci in older age. Sulcal depth showed significant linear decline in three sulci and quadratic trend in one sulcus. Turning points of non-linear trajectories towards accelerated widening of the fold were found to be around the age between 75 and 80, indicating an accelerated atrophy of brain cortex starting in the age of late 70s. Our findings of cortical sulcal changes in normal ageing could provide a reference for studies of neurocognitive disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases, in the elderly.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.02.034  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Despite the common conception of the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) as a single brain region, its diverse connectivity profiles and behavioral heterogeneity argue for a differentiated organization of the PMd. A previous study revealed that the right PMd is characterized by a rostro-caudal and a ventro-dorsal distinction dividing it into five subregions: rostral, central, caudal, ventral and dorsal. The present study assessed whether a similar organization is present in the left hemisphere, by capitalizing on a multimodal data-driven approach combining connectivity-based parcellation (CBP) based on meta-analytic modeling, resting-state functional connectivity, and probabilistic diffusion tractography. The resulting PMd modules were then characterized based on multimodal functional connectivity and a quantitative analysis of associated behavioral functions. Analyzing the clusters consistent across all modalities revealed an organization of the left PMd that mirrored its right counterpart to a large degree. Again, caudal, central and rostral modules reflected a cognitive-motor gradient and a premotor eye-field was found in the ventral part of the left PMd. In addition, a distinct module linked to abstract cognitive functions was observed in the rostro-ventral left PMd across all CBP modalities, implying greater differentiation of higher cognitive functions for the left than the right PMd.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.05.053  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Recently, we showed that the functional heterogeneity of the right dorsal premotor (PMd) cortex could be better understood by dividing it into five subregions that showed different behavioral associations according to task-based activations studies. The present study investigated whether the revealed behavioral profile could be corroborated and complemented by a structural brain behavior correlation approach in two healthy adults cohorts. Grey matter volume within the five volumes of interest (VOI-GM) was computed using voxel-based morphometry. Associations between the inter-individual differences in VOI-GM and performance across a range of neuropsychological tests were assessed in the two cohorts with and without correction for demographical variables. Additional analyses were performed in random smaller subsamples drawn from each of the two cohorts. In both cohorts, correlation coefficients were low; only few were significant and a considerable number of correlations were counterintuitive in their directions (i.e., higher performance related to lower grey matter volume). Furthermore, correlation patterns were inconsistent between the two cohorts. Subsampling revealed that correlation patterns could vary widely across small samples and that negative correlations were as likely as positive correlations. Thus, the structural brain-behavior approach did not corroborate the functional profiles of the PMd subregions inferred from activation studies, suggesting that local recruitment by fMRI studies does not necessarily imply covariance of local structure with behavioral performance in healthy adults. We discuss the limitations of such studies and related recommendations for future studies.

10.3390/ijms19010086  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Maternal obesity has been related to adverse neonatal outcomes and fetal programming. Oxidative stress and adipokines are potential biomarkers in such pregnancies; thus, the measurement of these molecules has been considered critical. Therefore, we developed artificial neural network (ANN) models based on maternal weight status and clinical data to predict reliable maternal blood concentrations of these biomarkers at the end of pregnancy. Adipokines (adiponectin, leptin, and resistin), and DNA, lipid and protein oxidative markers (8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine, malondialdehyde and carbonylated proteins, respectively) were assessed in blood of normal weight, overweight and obese women in the third trimester of pregnancy. A Back-propagation algorithm was used to train ANN models with four input variables (age, pre-gestational body mass index (p-BMI), weight status and gestational age). ANN models were able to accurately predict all biomarkers with regression coefficients greater than R² = 0.945. P-BMI was the most significant variable for estimating adiponectin and carbonylated proteins concentrations (37%), while gestational age was the most relevant variable to predict resistin and malondialdehyde (34%). Age, gestational age and p-BMI had the same significance for leptin values. Finally, for 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine prediction, the most significant variable was age (37%). These models become relevant to improve clinical and nutrition interventions in prenatal care.

10.1038/s41598-017-03450-0  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Fetal health is critically dependent on placental function, especially placental transport of oxygen from mother to fetus. When fetal growth is compromised, placental insufficiency must be distinguished from modest genetic growth potential. If placental insufficiency is present, the physician must trade off the risk of prolonged fetal exposure to placental insufficiency against the risks of preterm delivery. Current ultrasound methods to evaluate the placenta are indirect and insensitive. We propose to use Blood-Oxygenation-Level-Dependent (BOLD) MRI with maternal hyperoxia to quantitatively assess mismatch in placental function in seven monozygotic twin pairs naturally matched for genetic growth potential. In-utero BOLD MRI time series were acquired at 29 to 34 weeks gestational age. Maps of oxygen Time-To-Plateau (TTP) were obtained in the placentas by voxel-wise fitting of the time series. Fetal brain and liver volumes were measured based on structural MR images. After delivery, birth weights were obtained and placental pathological evaluations were performed. Mean placental TTP negatively correlated with fetal liver and brain volumes at the time of MRI as well as with birth weights. Mean placental TTP positively correlated with placental pathology. This study demonstrates the potential of BOLD MRI with maternal hyperoxia to quantify regional placental function in vivo.

10.1038/nprot.2017.120  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Neurons exhibit a rich diversity of morphological phenotypes, electrophysiological properties, and gene-expression patterns. Understanding how these different characteristics are interrelated at the single-cell level has been difficult because of the lack of techniques for multimodal profiling of individual cells. We recently developed Patch-seq, a technique that combines whole-cell patch-clamp recording, immunohistochemistry, and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to comprehensively profile single neurons from mouse brain slices. Here, we present a detailed step-by-step protocol, including modifications to the patching mechanics and recording procedure, reagents and recipes, procedures for immunohistochemistry, and other tips to assist researchers in obtaining high-quality morphological, electrophysiological, and transcriptomic data from single neurons. Successful implementation of Patch-seq allows researchers to explore the multidimensional phenotypic variability among neurons and to correlate gene expression with phenotype at the level of single cells. The entire procedure can be completed in ∼2 weeks through the combined efforts of a skilled electrophysiologist, molecular biologist, and biostatistician.

  Methods:  Pilot experiments resulted in the development and optimization of a paired-pulse TMS-EEG protocol at rest, during hyperventilation (HV), and post-HV combined with multi-level data analysis. This protocol was applied in 11 controls (C) and 25 GGE patients (P), further dichotomized into responders to antiepileptic drugs (R, n=13) and non-responders (n-R, n=12).Features (n=57) extracted from TMS-EEG responses after multi-level analysis were given to a feature selection scheme and a Bayesian classifier, and the accuracy of assigning participants into the classes P-C and R-nR was computed. 
  Results:  On the basis of the optimal feature subset, the cross-validated accuracy of TMS-EEG for the classification P-C was 0.86 at rest, 0.81 during HV and 0.92 at post-HV, whereas for R-nR the corresponding figures are 0.80, 0.78 and 0.65, respectively. Applying a fusion approach on all conditions resulted in an accuracy of 0.84 for the classification P-C and 0.76 for the classification R-nR. 
  Conclusion:  TMS-EEG can be used for diagnostic purposes and for assessing the response to antiepileptic drugs. 
  Significance:  TMS-EEG holds significant diagnostic potential in GGE.

10.1007/s40708-017-0067-5  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Computational neuroscience is a field that traces its origins to the efforts of Hodgkin and Huxley, who pioneered quantitative analysis of electrical activity in the nervous system. While also continuing as an independent field, computational neuroscience has combined with computational systems biology, and neural multiscale modeling arose as one offshoot. This consolidation has added electrical, graphical, dynamical system, learning theory, artificial intelligence and neural network viewpoints with the microscale of cellular biology (neuronal and glial), mesoscales of vascular, immunological and neuronal networks, on up to macroscales of cognition and behavior. The complexity of linkages that produces pathophysiology in neurological, neurosurgical and psychiatric disease will require multiscale modeling to provide understanding that exceeds what is possible with statistical analysis or highly simplified models: how to bring together pharmacotherapeutics with neurostimulation, how to personalize therapies, how to combine novel therapies with neurorehabilitation, how to interlace periodic diagnostic updates with frequent reevaluation of therapy, how to understand a physical disease that manifests as a disease of the mind. Multiscale modeling will also help to extend the usefulness of animal models of human diseases in neuroscience, where the disconnects between clinical and animal phenomenology are particularly pronounced. Here we cover areas of particular interest for clinical application of these new modeling neurotechnologies, including epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, ischemic disease, neurorehabilitation, drug addiction, schizophrenia and neurostimulation.

10.1107/S2059798317010932  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   An alternative rational approach to improve protein crystals by using single-site mutation of surface residues is proposed based on the results of a statistical analysis using a compiled data set of 918 independent crystal structures, thereby reflecting not only the entropic effect but also other effects upon protein crystallization. This analysis reveals a clear difference in the crystal-packing propensity of amino acids depending on the secondary-structural class. To verify this result, a systematic crystallization experiment was performed with the biotin carboxyl carrier protein from Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 (PhBCCP). Six single-site mutations were examined: Ala138 on the surface of a β-sheet was mutated to Ile, Tyr, Arg, Gln, Val and Lys. In agreement with prediction, it was observed that the two mutants (A138I and A138Y) harbouring the residues with the highest crystal-packing propensities for β-sheet at position 138 provided better crystallization scores relative to those of other constructs, including the wild type, and that the crystal-packing propensity for β-sheet provided the best correlation with the ratio of obtaining crystals. Two new crystal forms of these mutants were obtained that diffracted to high resolution, generating novel packing interfaces with the mutated residues (Ile/Tyr). The mutations introduced did not affect the overall structures, indicating that a β-sheet can accommodate a successful mutation if it is carefully selected so as to avoid intramolecular steric hindrance. A significant negative correlation between the ratio of obtaining amorphous precipitate and the crystal-packing propensity was also found.

10.1002/jmri.25585  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Purpose:  To present a method for spatiotemporal alignment of in-utero magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) time series acquired during maternal hyperoxia for enabling improved quantitative tracking of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes that characterize oxygen transport through the placenta to fetal organs. 
  Materials and methods:  The proposed pipeline for spatiotemporal alignment of images acquired with a single-shot gradient echo echo-planar imaging includes 1) signal nonuniformity correction, 2) intravolume motion correction based on nonrigid registration, 3) correction of motion and nonrigid deformations across volumes, and 4) detection of the outlier volumes to be discarded from subsequent analysis. BOLD MRI time series collected from 10 pregnant women during 3T scans were analyzed using this pipeline. To assess pipeline performance, signal fluctuations between consecutive timepoints were examined. In addition, volume overlap and distance between manual region of interest (ROI) delineations in a subset of frames and the delineations obtained through propagation of the ROIs from the reference frame were used to quantify alignment accuracy. A previously demonstrated rigid registration approach was used for comparison. 
  Results:  The proposed pipeline improved anatomical alignment of placenta and fetal organs over the state-of-the-art rigid motion correction methods. In particular, unexpected temporal signal fluctuations during the first normoxia period were significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.01) and volume overlap and distance between region boundaries measures were significantly improved (P &lt; 0.01). 
  Conclusion:  The proposed approach to align MRI time series enables more accurate quantitative studies of placental function by improving spatiotemporal alignment across placenta and fetal organs.

10.1109/LSP.2017.2754263  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Multimodal image registration facilitates the combination of complementary information from images acquired with different modalities. Most existing methods require computation of the joint histogram of the images, while some perform joint segmentation and registration in alternate iterations. In this work, we introduce a new non-information-theoretical method for pairwise multimodal image registration, in which the error of segmentation - using both images - is considered as the registration cost function. We empirically evaluate our method via rigid registration of multi-contrast brain magnetic resonance images, and demonstrate an often higher registration accuracy in the results produced by the proposed technique, compared to those by several existing methods.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.04.028  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Aligning brain structures across individuals is a central prerequisite for comparative neuroimaging studies. Typically, registration approaches assume a strong association between the features used for alignment, such as macro-anatomy, and the variable observed, such as functional activation or connectivity. Here, we propose to use the structure of intrinsic resting state fMRI signal correlation patterns as a basis for alignment of the cortex in functional studies. Rather than assuming the spatial correspondence of functional structures between subjects, we have identified locations with similar connectivity profiles across subjects. We mapped functional connectivity relationships within the brain into an embedding space, and aligned the resulting maps of multiple subjects. We then performed a diffeomorphic alignment of the cortical surfaces, driven by the corresponding features in the joint embedding space. Results show that functional alignment based on resting state fMRI identifies functionally homologous regions across individuals with higher accuracy than alignment based on the spatial correspondence of anatomy. Further, functional alignment enables measurement of the strength of the anatomo-functional link across the cortex, and reveals the uneven distribution of this link. Stronger anatomo-functional dissociation was found in higher association areas compared to primary sensory- and motor areas. Functional alignment based on resting state features improves group analysis of task based functional MRI data, increasing statistical power and improving the delineation of task-specific core regions. Finally, a comparison of the anatomo-functional dissociation between cohorts is demonstrated with a group of left and right handed subjects.

10.1016/j.nicl.2017.01.022  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   White matter lesions, quantified as 'white matter signal abnormalities' (WMSA) on neuroimaging, are common incidental findings on brain images of older adults. This tissue damage is linked to cerebrovascular dysfunction and is associated with cognitive decline. The regional distribution of WMSA throughout the cerebral white matter has been described at a gross scale; however, to date no prior study has described regional patterns relative to cortical gyral landmarks which may be important for understanding functional impact. Additionally, no prior study has described how regional WMSA volume scales with total global WMSA. Such information could be used in the creation of a pathologic 'staging' of WMSA through a detailed regional characterization at the individual level. Magnetic resonance imaging data from 97 cognitively-healthy older individuals (OC) aged 52-90 from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study were processed using a novel WMSA labeling procedure described in our prior work. WMSA were quantified regionally using a procedure that segments the cerebral white matter into 35 bilateral units based on proximity to landmarks in the cerebral cortex. An initial staging was performed by quantifying the regional WMSA volume in four groups based on quartiles of total WMSA volume (quartiles I-IV). A consistent spatial pattern of WMSA accumulation was observed with increasing quartile. A clustering procedure was then used to distinguish regions based on patterns of scaling of regional WMSA to global WMSA. Three patterns were extracted that showed high, medium, and non-scaling with global WMSA. Regions in the high-scaling cluster included periventricular, caudal and rostral middle frontal, inferior and superior parietal, supramarginal, and precuneus white matter. A data-driven staging procedure was then created based on patterns of WMSA scaling and specific regional cut-off values from the quartile analyses. Individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were then additionally staged, and significant differences in the percent of each diagnostic group in Stages I and IV were observed, with more AD individuals residing in Stage IV and more OC and MCI individuals residing in Stage I. These data demonstrate a consistent regional scaling relationship between global and regional WMSA that can be used to classify individuals into one of four stages of white matter disease. White matter staging could play an important role in a better understanding and the treatment of cerebrovascular contributions to brain aging and dementia.

10.1186/s12984-016-0212-z  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Most of the modern motorized prostheses are controlled with the surface electromyography (sEMG) recorded on the residual muscles of amputated limbs. However, the residual muscles are usually limited, especially after above-elbow amputations, which would not provide enough sEMG for the control of prostheses with multiple degrees of freedom. Signal fusion is a possible approach to solve the problem of insufficient control commands, where some non-EMG signals are combined with sEMG signals to provide sufficient information for motion intension decoding. In this study, a motion-classification method that combines sEMG and electroencephalography (EEG) signals were proposed and investigated, in order to improve the control performance of upper-limb prostheses. 
  Methods:  Four transhumeral amputees without any form of neurological disease were recruited in the experiments. Five motion classes including hand-open, hand-close, wrist-pronation, wrist-supination, and no-movement were specified. During the motion performances, sEMG and EEG signals were simultaneously acquired from the skin surface and scalp of the amputees, respectively. The two types of signals were independently preprocessed and then combined as a parallel control input. Four time-domain features were extracted and fed into a classifier trained by the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) algorithm for motion recognition. In addition, channel selections were performed by using the Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) algorithm to optimize the performance of the proposed method. 
  Results:  The classification performance achieved by the fusion of sEMG and EEG signals was significantly better than that obtained by single signal source of either sEMG or EEG. An increment of more than 14% in classification accuracy was achieved when using a combination of 32-channel sEMG and 64-channel EEG. Furthermore, based on the SFS algorithm, two optimized electrode arrangements (10-channel sEMG + 10-channel EEG, 10-channel sEMG + 20-channel EEG) were obtained with classification accuracies of 84.2 and 87.0%, respectively, which were about 7.2 and 10% higher than the accuracy by using only 32-channel sEMG input. 
  Conclusions:  This study demonstrated the feasibility of fusing sEMG and EEG signals towards improving motion classification accuracy for above-elbow amputees, which might enhance the control performances of multifunctional myoelectric prostheses in clinical application. 
  Trial registration:  The study was approved by the ethics committee of Institutional Review Board of Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, and the reference number is SIAT-IRB-150515-H0077.

10.1063/1.4981938  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Nondestructive evaluation using shearography requires a way to stress the inspection target. This technique is able to directly measure the displacement gradient distribution on the object surface. Shearography visualizes the internal structural damages as the anomalous pattern in the shearograpic fringe pattern. A piezoelectric (PZT) excitation system is able to generate loadings in the vibrational, acoustic, and ultrasonic regimes. In this paper, we propose a PZT-excited stroboscopic shearography. The PZT excitation could generate vibrational loading, a stationary wavefield, and a nonstationary propagation wave to fulfill the external loading requirement of shearography. The sweeping of the PZT excitation frequency, the formation of a standing wave, and a small shearing to suppress the incident wave were powerful controllable tools to detect the defects. The sweeping of the PZT excitation frequency enabled us to determine one of the defect-sensitive frequencies almost in real time. In addition, because the defect sensitive frequencies always existed in wide and plural ranges, the risk of the defect being overlooked by the inspector could be alleviated. The results of evaluation using stroboscopic shearography showed that an artificial 20 mm-diameter defect could be visualized at the excitation frequencies of 5-8 kHz range and 12.5-15.5 kHz range. This technique provided full field reliable and repeatable inspection results. Additionally, the proposed method overcame the important drawback of the time-averaged shearography, being required to identify the resonance vibration frequency sensitive to the defect.

10.1038/s41598-017-05819-7  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common bone tumor characterized with a high risk of amputation and malignant morbidity among teenagers and adolescents. However, relevant pathogenic/biological mechanisms underlying OS-genesis remains to be ambiguous. The aim of this study was to elucidate functional relationship about microRNAs-mRNAs networks and to identify potential molecular markers via a computational method. Gene expression profile (GSE70415) was recruited from Gene Expression Omnibus. 3856 differentially expressed genes and 250 significantly expressed microRNAs were identified by using GCBI. The results of GO and KEGG pathways associated proteomics analysis indicated that extracellular matrix organization, small molecule metabolic process, cell adhesion (GO IDs: 0030198, 0044281, 0007155) and pathways in cancer, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, metabolic pathways (pathway IDs: 5200, 4151, 1100) were significantly enriched. In addition, CKMT2, miR-93b-5p, miR-29b-3p were found to be positively/negatively correlated with TP53, EGFR, and MMP members mediated OS development, including angiogenesis, migration and invasion. Further visualization of collective effect of 1181 microRNAs-mRNAs pairs and protein-protein interactions was realized by applying with cytosacpe. In summary, our work provided a better understanding of non-coding regulatory mechanisms of transcriptomics and unraveled essential molecular biomarkers in osteosarcoma.

10.1371/journal.pone.0170859  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Endometriosis is characterized by growth of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterine cavity. Since its pathogenesis may involve epigenetic changes, we used Illumina 450K Methylation Beadchips to profile CpG methylation in endometriosis stromal cells compared to stromal cells from normal endometrium. We validated and extended the Beadchip data using bisulfite sequencing (bis-seq), and analyzed differential methylation (DM) at the CpG-level and by an element-level classification for groups of CpGs in chromatin domains. Genes found to have DM included examples encoding transporters (SLC22A23), signaling components (BDNF, DAPK1, ROR1, and WNT5A) and transcription factors (GATA family, HAND2, HOXA cluster, NR5A1, OSR2, TBX3). Intriguingly, among the TF genes with DM we also found JAZF1, a proto-oncogene affected by chromosomal translocations in endometrial stromal tumors. Using RNA-Seq we identified a subset of the DM genes showing differential expression (DE), with the likelihood of DE increasing with the extent of the DM and its location in enhancer elements. Supporting functional relevance, treatment of stromal cells with the hypomethylating drug 5aza-dC led to activation of DAPK1 and SLC22A23 and repression of HAND2, JAZF1, OSR2, and ROR1 mRNA expression. We found that global 5hmC is decreased in endometriotic versus normal epithelial but not stroma cells, and for JAZF1 and BDNF examined by oxidative bis-seq, found that when 5hmC is detected, patterns of 5hmC paralleled those of 5mC. Together with prior studies, these results define a consistent epigenetic signature in endometriosis stromal cells and nominate specific transcriptional and signaling pathways as therapeutic targets.

10.1038/srep43446  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Although hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the leading cause of liver fibrosis (LF), the mechanisms underlying liver fibrotic progression remain unclear. Here, we investigated the gene expression profiles of HBV-related LF patients. Whole genome expression arrays were used to detect gene expression in liver biopsy samples from chronically HBV infected patients. Through integrative data analysis, we identified several pathways and key genes involved in the initiation and exacerbation of liver fibrosis. Weight gene co-expression analysis revealed that integrin subunit β-like 1 (ITGBL1) was a key regulator of fibrogenesis. Functional experiments demonstrated that ITGBL1 was an upstream regulator of LF via interactions with transforming growth factor β1. In summary, we investigated the gene expression profiles of HBV-related LF patients and identified a key regulator ITGBL1. Our findings provide a foundation for future studies of gene functions and promote the development of novel antifibrotic therapies.

10.1016/j.bcp.2017.05.001  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most frequent complication of diabetes and one of leading causes of blindness worldwide. Early phases of DR are characterized by retinal pericyte loss mainly related to concurrent inflammatory process. Recently, an important link between P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) and inflammation has been demonstrated indicating this receptor as potential pharmacological target in DR. Here we first carried out an in silico molecular modeling study in order to characterize the allosteric pocket in P2X7R, and identify a suitable P2X7R antagonist through molecular docking. JNJ47965567 was identified as the hit compound in docking calculations, as well as for its absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) profile. As an in vitro model of early diabetic retinopathy, human retinal pericytes were exposed to high glucose (25mM, 48h) that caused a significant (p&lt;0.05) release of IL-1β and LDH. The block of P2X7R by JNJ47965567 significantly (p&lt;0.05) reverted the damage elicited by high glucose, detected as IL-1β and LDH release. Overall, our findings suggest that the P2X7R represents an attractive pharmacological target to manage the early phase of diabetic retinopathy, and the compound JNJ47965567 is a good template to discover other P2X7R selective antagonists.

10.1074/jbc.M117.801456  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Myosin-5B is a ubiquitous molecular motor that transports cargo vesicles of the endomembrane system in intracellular recycling pathways. Myosin-5B malfunction causes the congenital enteropathy microvillus inclusion disease, underlining its importance in cellular homeostasis. Here we describe the interaction of myosin-5B with F-actin, nucleotides, and the pyrazolopyrimidine compound myoVin-1. We show that single-headed myosin-5B is an intermediate duty ratio motor with a kinetic ATPase cycle that is rate-limited by the release of phosphate. The presence of a second head generates strain and gating in the myosin-5B dimer that alters the kinetic signature by reducing the actin-activated ADP release rate to become rate-limiting. This kinetic transition into a high-duty ratio motor is a prerequisite for the proposed transport function of myosin-5B in cellular recycling pathways. Moreover, we show that the small molecule compound myoVin-1 inhibits the enzymatic and functional activity of myosin-5B <i>in vitro</i> Partial inhibition of the actin-activated steady-state ATPase activity and sliding velocity suggests that caution should be used when probing the effect of myoVin-1 on myosin-5-dependent transport processes in cells.

10.1371/journal.pone.0180174  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The nature of the code used in the auditory cortex to represent complex auditory stimuli, such as naturally spoken words, remains a matter of debate. Here we argue that such representations are encoded by stable spatio-temporal patterns of firing within cell assemblies known as polychronous groups, or PGs. We develop a physiologically grounded, unsupervised spiking neural network model of the auditory brain with local, biologically realistic, spike-time dependent plasticity (STDP) learning, and show that the plastic cortical layers of the network develop PGs which convey substantially more information about the speaker independent identity of two naturally spoken word stimuli than does rate encoding that ignores the precise spike timings. We furthermore demonstrate that such informative PGs can only develop if the input spatio-temporal spike patterns to the plastic cortical areas of the model are relatively stable.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.12.055  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The hippocampus is a highly stress susceptible structure and hippocampal abnormalities have been reported in a host of psychiatric disorders including major depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The hippocampus appears to be particularly susceptible to early life stress with a graded reduction in volume based on number of types (multiplicity) or severity of maltreatment. We assessed whether the most important predictors of adult hippocampal volume were multiplicity, severity or duration of exposure or timing of maltreatment during developmental sensitive periods. 3T MRIs were collected on 336 unmedicated, right-handed subjects (132M/204F, 18-25 years). Exposure to broad categories of abuse and neglect during each year of childhood were assessed using the Maltreatment and Abuse Chronology of Exposure scale and evaluated using artificial intelligence and predictive analytics. Male hippocampal volume was predicted by neglect, but not abuse, up through 7 years of age. Female hippocampal volume was predicted by abuse, but not neglect, at 10, 11, 15 and 16 years. Exposure at peak age had greater predictive importance than multiplicity, severity or duration. There were also marked gender differences in subfields and portions (head, body or tail) affected by exposure. History and symptoms of major depression, PTSD or anxiety disorders were not predictive of hippocampal volume once maltreatment was accounted for. Neglect appears to foster inadequate hippocampal development in males while abuse appears to produce a stress-related deficit in females. Studies assessing hippocampal volume in psychiatric disorders need to control for the gender-specific effects of abuse and neglect.

10.1177/1745691617709589  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   During the past two decades, mindfulness meditation has gone from being a fringe topic of scientific investigation to being an occasional replacement for psychotherapy, tool of corporate well-being, widely implemented educational practice, and "key to building more resilient soldiers." Yet the mindfulness movement and empirical evidence supporting it have not gone without criticism. Misinformation and poor methodology associated with past studies of mindfulness may lead public consumers to be harmed, misled, and disappointed. Addressing such concerns, the present article discusses the difficulties of defining mindfulness, delineates the proper scope of research into mindfulness practices, and explicates crucial methodological issues for interpreting results from investigations of mindfulness. For doing so, the authors draw on their diverse areas of expertise to review the present state of mindfulness research, comprehensively summarizing what we do and do not know, while providing a prescriptive agenda for contemplative science, with a particular focus on assessment, mindfulness training, possible adverse effects, and intersection with brain imaging. Our goals are to inform interested scientists, the news media, and the public, to minimize harm, curb poor research practices, and staunch the flow of misinformation about the benefits, costs, and future prospects of mindfulness meditation.

10.1111/acel.12585  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Aging is a major worldwide medical challenge. Not surprisingly, identifying drugs and compounds that extend lifespan in model organisms is a growing research area. Here, we present DrugAge (http://genomics.senescence.info/drugs/), a curated database of lifespan-extending drugs and compounds. At the time of writing, DrugAge contains 1316 entries featuring 418 different compounds from studies across 27 model organisms, including worms, flies, yeast and mice. Data were manually curated from 324 publications. Using drug-gene interaction data, we also performed a functional enrichment analysis of targets of lifespan-extending drugs. Enriched terms include various functional categories related to glutathione and antioxidant activity, ion transport and metabolic processes. In addition, we found a modest but significant overlap between targets of lifespan-extending drugs and known aging-related genes, suggesting that some but not most aging-related pathways have been targeted pharmacologically in longevity studies. DrugAge is freely available online for the scientific community and will be an important resource for biogerontologists.

10.1111/his.13333  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Aims:  Evaluating expression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) by visual examination of immunohistochemistry (IHC) on invasive breast cancer (BCa) is a key part of the diagnostic assessment of BCa due to its recognized importance as a predictive and prognostic marker in clinical practice. However, visual scoring of HER2 is subjective, and consequently prone to interobserver variability. Given the prognostic and therapeutic implications of HER2 scoring, a more objective method is required. In this paper, we report on a recent automated HER2 scoring contest, held in conjunction with the annual PathSoc meeting held in Nottingham in June 2016, aimed at systematically comparing and advancing the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI)-based automated methods for HER2 scoring. 
  Methods and results:  The contest data set comprised digitized whole slide images (WSI) of sections from 86 cases of invasive breast carcinoma stained with both haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and IHC for HER2. The contesting algorithms predicted scores of the IHC slides automatically for an unseen subset of the data set and the predicted scores were compared with the 'ground truth' (a consensus score from at least two experts). We also report on a simple 'Man versus Machine' contest for the scoring of HER2 and show that the automated methods could beat the pathology experts on this contest data set. 
  Conclusions:  This paper presents a benchmark for comparing the performance of automated algorithms for scoring of HER2. It also demonstrates the enormous potential of automated algorithms in assisting the pathologist with objective IHC scoring.

10.1016/j.resuscitation.2017.03.007  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Aim:  To describe the 1-year neurobehavioral outcome of survivors of cardiac arrest secondary to drowning, compared with other respiratory etiologies, in children enrolled in the Therapeutic Hypothermia after Pediatric Cardiac Arrest Out-of-Hospital (THAPCA-OH) trial. 
  Methods:  Exploratory analysis of survivors (ages 1-18 years) who received chest compressions for ≥2min, were comatose, and required mechanical ventilation after return of circulation (ROC). Participants recruited from 27 pediatric intensive care units in North America received targeted temperature management [therapeutic hypothermia (33°C) or therapeutic normothermia (36.8°C)] within 6h of ROC. Neurobehavioral outcomes included 1-year Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition (VABS-II) total and domain scores and age-appropriate cognitive performance measures (Mullen Scales of Early Learning or Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence). 
  Results:  Sixty-six children with a respiratory etiology of cardiac arrest survived for 1-year; 60/66 had broadly normal premorbid functioning (VABS-II≥70). Follow up was obtained on 59/60 (30 with drowning etiology). VABS-II composite and domain scores declined significantly from premorbid scores in drowning and non-drowning groups (p&lt;0.001), although declines were less pronounced for the drowning group. Seventy-two percent of children had well below average cognitive functioning at 1-year. Younger age, fewer doses of epinephrine, and drowning etiology were associated with better VABS-II composite scores. Demographic variables and treatment with hypothermia did not influence neurobehavioral outcomes. 
  Conclusions:  Risks for poor neurobehavioral outcomes were high for children who were comatose after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to respiratory etiologies; survivors of drowning had better outcomes than those with other respiratory etiologies.
