10.1037/a0029759  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Summed-similarity models of short-term item recognition posit that participants base their judgments of an item's prior occurrence on that item's summed similarity to the ensemble of items on the remembered list. We examined the neural predictions of these models in 3 short-term recognition memory experiments using electrocorticographic/depth electrode recordings and scalp electroencephalography. On each experimental trial, participants judged whether a test face had been among a small set of recently studied faces. Consistent with summed-similarity theory, participants' tendency to endorse a test item increased as a function of its summed similarity to the items on the just-studied list. To characterize this behavioral effect of summed similarity, we successfully fit a summed-similarity model to individual participant data from each experiment. Using the parameters determined from fitting the summed-similarity model to the behavioral data, we examined the relation between summed similarity and brain activity. We found that 4-9 Hz theta activity in the medial temporal lobe and 2-4 Hz delta activity recorded from frontal and parietal cortices increased with summed similarity. These findings demonstrate direct neural correlates of the similarity computations that form the foundation of several major cognitive theories of human recognition memory.

10.1016/j.ejso.2012.10.001  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Aims:  To evaluate the feasibility and safety of robotic radical hysterectomy (RRH) with pelvic lymphadenectomy for locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). 
  Methods:  Starting from 04/2009, consecutive patients with LACC were submitted to robotic surgical staging after NACT. Surgical outcomes were compared to those achieved by women undergoing robotic surgery for an early stage disease during the same temporal interval. 
  Results:  Overall 25 (Group 1) and 21 (Group 2) patients had an early stage and a LACC, respectively. Among women with LACC, 18 achieved best tumor responses to NACT and therefore they were addressed to RRH. Outcomes resulted comparable between Groups in terms of operative time, blood loss, hospitalization and complications. No differences were found in terms of nodal yield, parametrial and vaginal cuff length. 
  Conclusions:  RRH is feasible and safe also in patients previously submitted to NACT for LACC. Larger series with longer follow-up are mandatory to establish survival outcomes.

10.1021/ct400383v  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Here we present a novel, end-point method using the dead-end-elimination and A* algorithms to efficiently and accurately calculate the change in free energy, enthalpy, and configurational entropy of binding for ligand-receptor association reactions. We apply the new approach to the binding of a series of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) protease inhibitors to examine the effect ensemble reranking has on relative accuracy as well as to evaluate the role of the absolute and relative ligand configurational entropy losses upon binding in affinity differences for structurally related inhibitors. Our results suggest that most thermodynamic parameters can be estimated using only a small fraction of the full configurational space, and we see significant improvement in relative accuracy when using an ensemble versus single-conformer approach to ligand ranking. We also find that using approximate metrics based on the single-conformation enthalpy differences between the global minimum energy configuration in the bound as well as unbound states also correlates well with experiment. Using a novel, additive entropy expansion based on conditional mutual information, we also analyze the source of ligand configurational entropy loss upon binding in terms of both uncoupled per degree of freedom losses as well as changes in coupling between inhibitor degrees of freedom. We estimate entropic free energy losses of approximately +24 kcal/mol, 12 kcal/mol of which stems from loss of translational and rotational entropy. Coupling effects contribute only a small fraction to the overall entropy change (1-2 kcal/mol) but suggest differences in how inhibitor dihedral angles couple to each other in the bound versus unbound states. The importance of accounting for flexibility in drug optimization and design is also discussed.

10.1111/cogs.12062  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Judea Pearl has argued that counterfactuals and causality are central to intelligence, whether natural or artificial, and has helped create a rich mathematical and computational framework for formally analyzing causality. Here, we draw out connections between these notions and various current issues in cognitive science, including the nature of mental "programs" and mental representation. We argue that programs (consisting of algorithms and data structures) have a causal (counterfactual-supporting) structure; these counterfactuals can reveal the nature of mental representations. Programs can also provide a causal model of the external world. Such models are, we suggest, ubiquitous in perception, cognition, and language processing.

10.1101/gr.144899.112  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Genome-wide chromatin annotations have permitted the mapping of putative regulatory elements across multiple human cell types. However, their experimental dissection by directed regulatory motif disruption has remained unfeasible at the genome scale. Here, we use a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to measure the transcriptional levels induced by 145-bp DNA segments centered on evolutionarily conserved regulatory motif instances within enhancer chromatin states. We select five predicted activators (HNF1, HNF4, FOXA, GATA, NFE2L2) and two predicted repressors (GFI1, ZFP161) and measure reporter expression in erythroleukemia (K562) and liver carcinoma (HepG2) cell lines. We test 2104 wild-type sequences and 3314 engineered enhancer variants containing targeted motif disruptions, each using 10 barcode tags and two replicates. The resulting data strongly confirm the enhancer activity and cell-type specificity of enhancer chromatin states, the ability of 145-bp segments to recapitulate both, the necessary role of regulatory motifs in enhancer function, and the complementary roles of activator and repressor motifs. We find statistically robust evidence that (1) disrupting the predicted activator motifs abolishes enhancer function, while silent or motif-improving changes maintain enhancer activity; (2) evolutionary conservation, nucleosome exclusion, binding of other factors, and strength of the motif match are predictive of enhancer activity; (3) scrambling repressor motifs leads to aberrant reporter expression in cell lines where the enhancers are usually inactive. Our results suggest a general strategy for deciphering cis-regulatory elements by systematic large-scale manipulation and provide quantitative enhancer activity measurements across thousands of constructs that can be mined to develop predictive models of gene expression.

10.1371/journal.pone.0059558  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Glioma initiating cells (GICs) are considered responsible for the therapeutic resistance and recurrence of malignant glioma. To clarify the molecular mechanism of GIC maintenance/differentiation, we established GIC clones having the potential to differentiate into malignant gliomas, and subjected to DNA microarray/iTRAQ based integrated proteomics. 21,857 mRNAs and 8,471 proteins were identified and integrated into a gene/protein expression analysis chart. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that the expression of cell adhesion molecules, including integrin subfamilies, such as α2 and αV, and extracellular matrices (ECMs), such as collagen IV (COL4), laminin α2 (LAMA2), and fibronectin 1 (FN), was significantly upregulated during serum-induced GIC differentiation. This differentiation process, accompanied by the upregulation of MAPK as well as glioma specific proteins in GICs, was dramatically accelerated in these ECM (especially FN)-coated dishes. Integrin αV blocking antibody and RGD peptide significantly suppressed early events in GIC differentiation, suggesting that the coupling of ECMs to integrin αV is necessary for GIC differentiation. In addition, the expression of integrin αV and its strong ligand FN was prominently increased in glioblastomas developed from mouse intracranial GIC xenografts. Interestingly, during the initial phase of GIC differentiation, the RGD treatment significantly inhibited GIC proliferation and raised their sensitivity against anti-cancer drug temozolomide (TMZ). We also found that combination treatments of TMZ and RGD inhibit glioma progression and lead the longer survival of mouse intracranial GIC xenograft model. These results indicate that GICs induce/secrete ECMs to develop microenvironments with serum factors, namely differentiation niches that further stimulate GIC differentiation and proliferation via the integrin recognition motif RGD. A combination of RGD treatment with TMZ could have the higher inhibitory potential against the glioma recurrence that may be regulated by the GICs in the differentiation niche. This study provides a new perspective for developing therapeutic strategies against the early onset of GIC-associated glioma.

10.1111/j.1464-410X.2013.11798.x  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Objective:  To evaluate the perioperative and pathological outcomes associated with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) in morbidly obese men. 
  Patients and methods:  Between January 2008 and March 2012, 3041 patients underwent RARP at our institution by a single surgeon (V.P.). In all, 44 patients were considered morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥40 kg/m(2) . A propensity score-matched analysis was conducted using multivariable analysis to identify comparable groups of patients with a BMI of ≥40 and &lt;40 kg/m(2) . Perioperative, pathological outcomes and complications were compared between the two matched groups. 
  Results:  There was no significant difference in operative time. However, the mean estimated blood loss was higher in morbidly obese patients, at a mean (sd) of 113 (41) vs 130 (27) mL (P = 0.049). Anastomosis was more difficult in morbidly obese patients (P = 0.001). There were no significant differences in laterality, ease of nerve sparing, or transfusion rate between the groups. There were no intraoperative complications in either group. Postoperative pathological outcomes were similar between the groups. Differences in positive surgical margins and ease of nerve sparing approached statistical significance (P = 0.097, P = 0.075 respectively). Postoperative complication rates, pain scores, length of stay and indwelling catheter duration were similar in the groups. 
  Conclusions:  RARP in morbidly obese patients is technically demanding. However, it can be accomplished with acceptable morbidity and resource use. In the hands of an experienced surgeon, it is a safe procedure and offers beneficial clinical outcomes.

10.1016/j.eururo.2013.05.050  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with totally intracorporeal neobladder diversion is a complex procedure that has been reported with good outcomes in small series. 
  Objective:  To present complications and oncologic and functional outcomes of this procedure. 
  Design, setting, and participants:  Between 2003 and 2012 in a tertiary referral center, 70 patients were operated on by two experienced robotic surgeons. Data were collected prospectively and reviewed retrospectively. 
  Intervention:  RARC with totally intracorporeal modified Studer ileal neobladder formation. 
  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:  The overall outcome of RARC with a totally intracorporeal neobladder was presented by assessing (1) surgical margins, (2) recurrence or cancer-specific death at 24 mo, (3) 30-d and 90-d complications graded according to the modified Clavien-Dindo system, (4) daytime and nighttime continence (no or one pad per day) at 6 and 12 mo, and (5) satisfactory sexual activity or potency at 6 mo and 12 mo. Survival rates were estimated by Kaplan-Meier plots. 
  Results and limitations:  Median follow-up of the cohort was 30.3 mo (interquartile range: 12.7-35.6). We recorded negative margins in 69 of 70 patients (98.6%). Clavien 3-5 complications occurred in 22 of 70 patients (31.4%) at 30 d and 13 of 70 (18.6%) at &gt;30 d. At 90 d, the overall complication rate was 58.5%. Clavien &lt;3 and Clavien ≥3 complications were recorded in 15 of 70 patients (21.4%) and 26 of 70 (37.1%), respectively. Kaplan-Meier estimates for recurrence-free, cancer-specific, and overall survival at 24 mo were 80.7%, 88.9%, and 88.9%, respectively. Daytime continence and satisfactory sexual function or potency at 12 mo ranged between 70% and 90% in both men and women. Limitations of this study include its retrospective design, selection bias due to the learning curve phase, and missing data. 
  Conclusions:  In this expert center for RARC, outcomes after RARC with totally intracorporeal neobladder diversion appear satisfactory and in line with contemporary open series.

These peptides are known to act as preferred dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) substrates. Five casein-derived synthetic peptides (Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr, Leu-Pro-Leu-Pro-Leu, Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Tyr, Leu-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Tyr and Ile-Pro-Ile) and a casein (CasH), whey (WPH) and lactoferrin hydrolysate (LFH) generated with gastrointestinal enzymes were incubated with DPP-IV at 37 °C for 18 or 24h. Peptide breakdown was evident following incubation with DPP-IV. Different modes of DPP-IV inhibition were observed depending on the test compound. Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr, Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Tyr and Leu-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Tyr were substrate-, Leu-Pro-Leu-Pro-Leu and CasH were prodrug- while WPH and LFH were true DPP-IV inhibitors. These results are relevant for the bioactivity and bioavailability of functional foods targeting DPP-IV inhibition with potential blood glucose regulatory properties in humans.

10.1371/journal.pone.0079720  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   In the study of complex genetic diseases, the identification of subgroups of patients sharing similar genetic characteristics represents a challenging task, for example, to improve treatment decision. One type of genetic lesion, frequently investigated in such disorders, is the change of the DNA copy number (CN) at specific genomic traits. Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a standard technique to reduce the dimensionality of a data set and to cluster data samples, while keeping its most relevant information in meaningful components. Thus, it can be used to discover subgroups of patients from CN profiles. It is however computationally impractical for very high dimensional data, such as CN microarray data. Deciding the most suitable number of subgroups is also a challenging problem. The aim of this work is to derive a procedure to compact high dimensional data, in order to improve NMF applicability without compromising the quality of the clustering. This is particularly important for analyzing high-resolution microarray data. Many commonly used quality measures, as well as our own measures, are employed to decide the number of subgroups and to assess the quality of the results. Our measures are based on the idea of identifying robust subgroups, inspired by biologically/clinically relevance instead of simply aiming at well-separated clusters. We evaluate our procedure using four real independent data sets. In these data sets, our method was able to find accurate subgroups with individual molecular and clinical features and outperformed the standard NMF in terms of accuracy in the factorization fitness function. Hence, it can be useful for the discovery of subgroups of patients with similar CN profiles in the study of heterogeneous diseases.

10.1111/j.1464-410X.2012.11487.x  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   WHAT'S KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT? AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Removing of prostate for the treatment of localized prostate cancer is associated with a variable loss of erectile function due to injury of the nerves of erection during operation. Some researchers have reported that after nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy (RP), the natural recovery time of erectile function is at least 2 years. Factors such as thermal damage, ischaemic injury, mechanically induced nerve stretching and the local inflammatory effects of surgical trauma may also impair the cavernous nerves during RP. The concept of penile rehabilitation was first studied by Montorsi et al. in 1997. They showed that the use of any drug or device at or after RP could maximize the recovery of erectile function. Penile rehabilitation programmes (PRPs) with vasoactive agents, such as oral phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5Is), intraurethral and intracavernosal vasoactive agents, and vacuum erection devices (VEDs) can protect erectile tissue integrity and prevent corporal smooth muscle atrophy and diminish collagen formation. The present findings are consistent with previous reports that PRPs have a significant beneficial effect on early erectile function recovery and that preoperative erectile function is one of the important predictors of erectile function after RP. Patients can be referred for penile rehabilitation if they have any degree of erectile function (mild, moderate or normal) before operation. We also showed that the combination of PDE5Is and VEDs for PRPs offers the shortest erectile function recovery period. 
  Objective:  To define the optimal penile rehabilitation programme (PRP) based on preoperative Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) scores after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). 
  Patients and methods:  The medical records of 203 patients who underwent bilateral nerve-sparing RARP between 2007 and 2011 were reviewed for the present retrospective study. According to patients' preoperative erection status, group 1 (SHIM = 8-16), group 2 (SHIM = 17-21) and group 3 (SHIM = 22-25) were defined. After bilateral nerve-sparing RARP, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5Is), a vacuum erection device (VED), the combination of PDE5Is and a VED, or none of them were utilized by all patients for penile rehabilitation. Treatment success was defined as a rigid erection suitable for successful sexual intercourse. 
  Results:  The numbers of patients in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively, were 9, 22 and 73, and the mean erectile function recovery periods (EFRPs) were 15.44 ± 7.73, 12.31 ± 8.12 and 8.73 ± 5.67 months (P &lt; 0.05). Group 3 offered the best results for EFRP. Only PDE5Is or the combination of PDE5Is and VED use had a beneficial effect on EFRP (P &lt; 0.05). Using PDE5Is and VED together provided the best result, but there was no difference between PDE5Is and a VED (P ≥ 0.05). 
  Conclusions:  After bilateral nerve-sparing RARP, PRP with PDE5Is, including the combination of PDE5Is and VED, has a beneficial effect on erectile function recovery across all levels of baseline erectile function. Further large randomized control studies are needed to validate these findings.

10.1093/pcp/pct029  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Comprehensive genome-wide gene expression profiles during plant male gametogenesis have been thoroughly analyzed over the last decade. In contrast, gene expression profiles during female gametogenesis have been studied relatively little, and our knowledge concerning plant female gametogenesis is limited. We determined the genome-wide gene expression profiles of developing ovules containing female gametophytes from the megaspore mother cell at the pre-meiotic stage to the mature embryo sac in rice (Oryza sativa) using microarrays. In order to separate ovules from scutellum, we used a laser microdissection (LM) technique. Dynamic gene expression was revealed in developing ovules, and a major transition of the transcriptome was observed between middle and late meiotic stages, where many genes were down-regulated &gt;10-fold. Many potential players in female gametogenesis, that showed dynamic or enriched expression, were highlighted. We identified the temporal and dramatic up-regulation of a subset of transposable elements during female meiotic stages that were not observed in males. Transcription factor genes enriched in developing ovules were also uncovered, which may play crucial roles during female gametogenesis. This is the first report of comprehensive genome-wide gene expression profiles during female gametogenesis useful for plant reproductive studies. Combined with additional experiments, our data may provide important clues to understand female gametogenesis in plants.

10.1371/journal.pone.0065426  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  SET domain is responsible for the catalytic activity of histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTs) during developmental process. Histone lysine methylation plays a crucial and diverse regulatory function in chromatin organization and genome function. Although several SET genes have been identified and characterized in plants, the understanding of OsSET gene family in rice is still very limited. 
  Methodology/principal findings:  In this study, a systematic analysis was performed and revealed the presence of at least 43 SET genes in rice genome. Phylogenetic and structural analysis grouped SET proteins into five classes, and supposed that the domains out of SET domain were significant for the specific of histone lysine methylation, as well as the recognition of methylated histone lysine. Based on the global microarray, gene expression profile revealed that the transcripts of OsSET genes were accumulated differentially during vegetative and reproductive developmental stages and preferentially up or down-regulated in different tissues. Cis-elements identification, co-expression analysis and GO analysis of expression correlation of 12 OsSET genes suggested that OsSET genes might be involved in cell cycle regulation and feedback. 
  Conclusions/significance:  This study will facilitate further studies on OsSET family and provide useful clues for functional validation of OsSETs.

10.1371/journal.pone.0061820  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  The sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), is one of the most widely distributed agricultural pests. Although it has developed resistance to many registered insecticides including the neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam, the mechanisms that regulate the resistance are poorly understood. To understand the molecular basis of thiamethoxam resistance, "omics" analyses were carried out to examine differences between resistant and susceptible B. tabaci at both transcriptional and translational levels. 
  Results:  A total of 1,338 mRNAs and 52 proteins were differentially expressed between resistant and susceptible B. tabaci. Among them, 11 transcripts had concurrent transcription and translation profiles. KEGG analysis mapped 318 and 35 differentially expressed genes and proteins, respectively, to 160 and 59 pathways (p&lt;0.05). Thiamethoxam treatment activated metabolic pathways (e.g., drug metabolism), in which 118 transcripts were putatively linked to insecticide resistance, including up-regulated glutathione-S-transferase, UDP glucuronosyltransferase, glucosyl/glucuronosyl transferase, and cytochrome P450. Gene Ontology analysis placed these genes and proteins into protein complex, metabolic process, cellular process, signaling, and response to stimulus categories. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis validated "omics" response, and suggested a highly overexpressed P450, CYP6CX1, as a candidate molecular basis for the mechanistic study of thiamethoxam resistance in whiteflies. Finally, enzymatic activity assays showed elevated detoxification activities in the resistant B. tabaci. 
  Conclusions:  This study demonstrates the applicability of high-throughput omics tools for identifying molecular candidates related to thiamethoxam resistance in an agricultural important insect pest. In addition, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses provide a solid foundation for future functional investigations into the complex molecular mechanisms governing the neonicotinoid resistance in whiteflies.

10.1007/s11010-013-1888-z  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Satb2 acts as a potent transcription factor to promote osteoblast differentiation and bone regeneration. Recently, microRNAs (miRNA) have been identified as critical regulators of osteogenic differentiation. This study aimed to identify specific miRNAs and their regulatory roles in the process of Satb2-induced osteogenic differentiation. We studied the differentially expressed miRNAs by Satb2 overexpression in murine bone marrow stromal cells using miRNA microarray. Ten down-regulated miRNAs including miR-27a, miR-125a-5p, and miR-466f-3p, and 18 up-regulated miRNAs including miR-17, miR-20a and miR-210 were found to be differentially expressed and their expression were verified by quantitative real time PCR. The differentially expressed miRNAs were further subjected to gene ontology and KEGG analysis. The highly enriched GOs and KEGG pathway showed target genes of these miRNAs were significantly involved in multiple biological processes (mesenchymal cell differentiation, bone formation, and skeletal development), and several osteogenic pathways (TGF-β/BMP, MAPK, and Wnt signaling pathway). Finally, miR-27a was selected for target verification and function analysis. BMP2, BMPR1A, and Smad9, members of the TGF-β/BMP superfamily, which were predicted to be target genes of miR-27a, were confirmed to be significantly up-regulated in Satb2-overexpressing cells by quantitative real time PCR. Overexpression of miR-27a significantly inhibited osteogenesis and repressed BMP2, BMPR1A, and Smad9 expression. In this study, we identified that a number of differentially regulated miRNAs, whose target genes involved in the TGF-β/BMP signaling pathway, play an important role in the early stage of Satb2-induced osteogenic differentiation.

10.1007/s00345-012-1008-9  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Objectives:  To identify the predictive tools which have emerged recently in the field of urothelial carcinomas. 
  Materials and methods:  We performed a thorough MEDLINE literature review using a combination of the following keywords: urothelial carcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma, bladder, renal pelvis, ureter, predictive tools, predictive models and nomograms. We found 117 articles, but only the relevant reports were selected. 
  Results:  The majority of available tools are prediction models, particularly nomograms. These models combine good performance accuracy with ease of use. They appear to be more accurate than risk grouping or tree modeling and are more suitable for clinicians than artificial intelligence. The most recent nomograms have been designed to be used in daily clinical practice and are even available as computer or smartphone applications. They focus on pathological outcomes or more frequently on survival statistics or recurrence risk after surgery. They provide an accurate prediction of disease evolution and may help clinicians to choose the most appropriate treatment option. However, these prediction tools still need to be validated and regularly utilized. 
  Conclusion:  Predictive tools represent very helpful clinical decision-making aids but need to be validated in larger populations.

10.1101/gr.137091.111  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Recent genome-wide computational screens that search for conservation of RNA secondary structure in whole-genome alignments (WGAs) have predicted thousands of structural noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). The sensitivity of such approaches, however, is limited, due to their reliance on sequence-based whole-genome aligners, which regularly misalign structural ncRNAs. This suggests that many more structural ncRNAs may remain undetected. Structure-based alignment, which could increase the sensitivity, has been prohibitive for genome-wide screens due to its extreme computational costs. Breaking this barrier, we present the pipeline REAPR (RE-Alignment for Prediction of structural ncRNA), which efficiently realigns whole genomes based on RNA sequence and structure, thus allowing us to boost the performance of de novo ncRNA predictors, such as RNAz. Key to the pipeline's efficiency is the development of a novel banding technique for multiple RNA alignment. REAPR significantly outperforms the widely used predictors RNAz and EvoFold in genome-wide screens; in direct comparison to the most recent RNAz screen on D. melanogaster, REAPR predicts twice as many high-confidence ncRNA candidates. Moreover, modENCODE RNA-seq experiments confirm a substantial number of its predictions as transcripts. REAPR's advancement of de novo structural characterization of ncRNAs complements the identification of transcripts from rapidly accumulating RNA-seq data.

10.1121/1.4819248  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   This paper is an outcome of a workshop that addressed the question how soundscape research can improve its impact on the local level. It addresses a number of topics by complementing existing approaches and practices with possible future approaches and practices. The paper starts with an analysis of the role of sound annoyance and suboptimal soundscapes on the lives of individuals and concludes that a good soundscape, or more generally a good sensescape, is at the same time pleasant as well as conducive for the adoption of healthy habits. To maintain or improve sensescape quality, urban planning needs improved design tools that allow for a more holistic optimization and an active role of the local stakeholders. Associated with this is a gradual development from government to governance in which optimization of the soundscape at a local (administrative or geographic) level is directly influenced by the users of spaces. The paper concludes that soundscape research can have a greater impact by helping urban planners design for health and pleasant experiences as well as developing tools for improved citizen involvement in local optimization.

10.1371/journal.pone.0069952  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Over successive stages, the ventral visual system of the primate brain develops neurons that respond selectively to particular objects or faces with translation, size and view invariance. The powerful neural representations found in Inferotemporal cortex form a remarkably rapid and robust basis for object recognition which belies the difficulties faced by the system when learning in natural visual environments. A central issue in understanding the process of biological object recognition is how these neurons learn to form separate representations of objects from complex visual scenes composed of multiple objects. We show how a one-layer competitive network comprised of 'spiking' neurons is able to learn separate transformation-invariant representations (exemplified by one-dimensional translations) of visual objects that are always seen together moving in lock-step, but separated in space. This is achieved by combining 'Mexican hat' functional lateral connectivity with cell firing-rate adaptation to temporally segment input representations of competing stimuli through anti-phase oscillations (perceptual cycles). These spiking dynamics are quickly and reliably generated, enabling selective modification of the feed-forward connections to neurons in the next layer through Spike-Time-Dependent Plasticity (STDP), resulting in separate translation-invariant representations of each stimulus. Variations in key properties of the model are investigated with respect to the network's ability to develop appropriate input representations and subsequently output representations through STDP. Contrary to earlier rate-coded models of this learning process, this work shows how spiking neural networks may learn about more than one stimulus together without suffering from the 'superposition catastrophe'. We take these results to suggest that spiking dynamics are key to understanding biological visual object recognition.

10.1371/journal.pone.0081638  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The development of ICT infrastructures has facilitated the emergence of new paradigms for looking at society and the environment over the last few years. Participatory environmental sensing, i.e. directly involving citizens in environmental monitoring, is one example, which is hoped to encourage learning and enhance awareness of environmental issues. In this paper, an analysis of the behaviour of individuals involved in noise sensing is presented. Citizens have been involved in noise measuring activities through the WideNoise smartphone application. This application has been designed to record both objective (noise samples) and subjective (opinions, feelings) data. The application has been open to be used freely by anyone and has been widely employed worldwide. In addition, several test cases have been organised in European countries. Based on the information submitted by users, an analysis of emerging awareness and learning is performed. The data show that changes in the way the environment is perceived after repeated usage of the application do appear. Specifically, users learn how to recognise different noise levels they are exposed to. Additionally, the subjective data collected indicate an increased user involvement in time and a categorisation effect between pleasant and less pleasant environments.

10.1007/978-3-319-02126-3_3  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   We present an analysis framework for large studies of multimodal clinical quality brain image collections. Processing and analysis of such datasets is challenging due to low resolution, poor contrast, mis-aligned images, and restricted field of view. We adapt existing registration and segmentation methods and build a computational pipeline for spatial normalization and feature extraction. The resulting aligned dataset enables clinically meaningful analysis of spatial distributions of relevant anatomical features and of their evolution with age and disease progression. We demonstrate the approach on a neuroimaging study of stroke with more than 800 patients. We show that by combining data from several modalities, we can automatically segment important biomarkers such as white matter hyperintensity and characterize pathology evolution in this heterogeneous cohort. Specifically, we examine two sub-populations with different dynamics of white matter hyperintensity changes as a function of patients' age. Pipeline and analysis code is available at http://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/medical-vision/stroke/.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btt486  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Motivation:  The global alignment of protein interaction networks is a widely studied problem. It is an important first step in understanding the relationship between the proteins in different species and identifying functional orthologs. Furthermore, it can provide useful insights into the species' evolution. 
  Results:  We propose a novel algorithm, PISwap, for optimizing global pairwise alignments of protein interaction networks, based on a local optimization heuristic that has previously demonstrated its effectiveness for a variety of other intractable problems. PISwap can begin with different types of network alignment approaches and then iteratively adjust the initial alignments by incorporating network topology information, trading it off for sequence information. In practice, our algorithm efficiently refines other well-studied alignment techniques with almost no additional time cost. We also show the robustness of the algorithm to noise in protein interaction data. In addition, the flexible nature of this algorithm makes it suitable for different applications of network alignment. This algorithm can yield interesting insights into the evolutionary dynamics of related species.

10.1104/pp.113.221895  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Low red light/far-red light ratio (R:FR) serves as an indicator of impending competition and has been demonstrated to suppress branch development. The regulation of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) rosette bud outgrowth by the R:FR and the associated mechanisms were investigated at several levels. Growth under low R:FR suppressed outgrowth of the third from topmost bud (bud n-2) but not that of the topmost bud. Subsequently increasing the R:FR near the time of anthesis promoted bud n-2 outgrowth and reduced topmost bud growth. Buds from specific rosette positions, exhibiting divergent fates to increased R:FR, were harvested 3 h after modifying the R:FR and were used to conduct ATH1 microarray-based transcriptome profiling. Differentially expressed genes showed enrichment of light signaling and hormone-related Gene Ontology terms and promoter motifs, most notably those associated with abscisic acid (ABA). Genes associated with ABA biosynthesis, including the key biosynthetic gene NINE-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE3 (NCED3), and with ABA signaling were expressed at higher levels in the responsive bud n-2, and increasing the R:FR decreased their expression only in bud n-2. ABA abundance in responsive buds decreased within 12 h of increasing the R:FR, while indole-3-acetic acid levels did not change. A role for ABA in repressing bud outgrowth from lower positions under low R:FR was demonstrated using the nced3-2 and aba2-1 ABA biosynthesis mutants, which showed enhanced branching and a defective bud n-2 outgrowth response to low R:FR. The results provide evidence that ABA regulates bud outgrowth responses to the R:FR and thus extend the known hormonal pathways associated with the regulation of branching and shade avoidance.

10.1093/nar/gkt1249  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Recent advances in technology have led to a dramatic increase in the number of available transcription factor ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip data sets. Understanding the motif content of these data sets is an important step in understanding the underlying mechanisms of regulation. Here we provide a systematic motif analysis for 427 human ChIP-seq data sets using motifs curated from the literature and also discovered de novo using five established motif discovery tools. We use a systematic pipeline for calculating motif enrichment in each data set, providing a principled way for choosing between motif variants found in the literature and for flagging potentially problematic data sets. Our analysis confirms the known specificity of 41 of the 56 analyzed factor groups and reveals motifs of potential cofactors. We also use cell type-specific binding to find factors active in specific conditions. The resource we provide is accessible both for browsing a small number of factors and for performing large-scale systematic analyses. We provide motif matrices, instances and enrichments in each of the ENCODE data sets. The motifs discovered here have been used in parallel studies to validate the specificity of antibodies, understand cooperativity between data sets and measure the variation of motif binding across individuals and species.

10.1186/1479-5876-11-239  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  The incidence and mortality of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is higher in African Americans (AA) than other racial/ethnic groups in the U.S., but the reasons for this disparity are unknown. There is an urgent need for the discovery of novel molecular signatures for HCV disease progression to understand the underlying biological basis for this cancer rate disparity to improve the clinical outcome. 
  Methods:  We performed differential proteomics with isobaric labeling tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) and MS/MS analysis to identify proteins differentially expressed in cirrhotic (CIR) and HCC as compared to normal tissues of Caucasian American (CA) patients. The raw data were analyzed using the ProteinPilot v3.0. Searches were performed against all known sequences populating the Swiss-Prot, Refseq, and TrEMBL databases. Quality control analyses were accomplished using pairwise correlation plots, boxplots, principal component analysis, and unsupervised hierarchical clustering. Supervised analysis was carried out to identify differentially expressed proteins. Candidates were validated in independent cohorts of CA and AA tissues by qRT-PCR or Western blotting. 
  Results:  A total of 238 unique proteins were identified. Of those, around 15% were differentially expressed between normal, CIR &amp; HCC groups. Target validation demonstrates racially distinct alteration in the expression of certain proteins. For example, the mRNA expression levels of transferrin (TF) were 2 and18-fold higher in CIR and HCC in AA as compared to CA. Similarly; the expression of Apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1) was 7-fold higher in HCC of AA. This increase was mirrored in the protein expression levels. Interestingly, the level of hepatocyte nuclear factor4a (HNF4a) protein was down regulated in AA, whereas repression of transcription is seen more in CA compared to AA. These data suggest that racial disparities in HCC could be a consequence of differential dysregulation of HNF4a transcriptional activity. 
  Conclusion:  This study identifies novel molecular signatures in HCV-induced HCC using iTRAQ-based tissue proteomics. The proteins identified will further enhance a molecular explanation to the biochemical mechanism(s) that may play a role in HCC racial disparities.

10.1016/j.trsl.2012.12.013  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Albuminuria is a sensitive marker to predict future cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, current studies only use conventional regression models to discover predictors of albuminuria. We have used 2 different statistical models to predict albuminuria in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a multilayer perception neural network and a conditional logistic regression. Neural network models were used to predict the level of albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, which include a matched case-control study for the population. For each case, we randomly selected 1 control matched by age and body mass index (BMI). The input variables were sex, duration of diabetes, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein/triglyceride ratio, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, and glycated hemoglobin. Age and BMI were included only in the neural network model. This model included 4 hidden layers and 1 bias. Relative error of predictions was 0.38% in the training group, 0.52% in the testing group, and 1.20% in the holdout group. The most robust predictors of albuminuria were high-density lipoprotein (21%), cholesterol (14.4%), and systolic blood pressure (9.7%). Using the conditional logistic regression model, glomerular filtration rate, time of onset to diabetes, and sex were significant indicators in the onset of albuminuria. Using a neural network model, we show that high-density lipoprotein is the most important factor in predicting albuminuria in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Our neural network model complements the current risk factor models to improve the care of patients with diabetes.

10.1016/j.urology.2013.05.013  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Objective:  To evaluate the operative and pathologic outcomes of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in men with progressive changes in body mass index (BMI) category. 
  Materials and methods:  A single-surgeon series of 1023 laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (mostly extraperitoneal) patients was considered. Of these patients, 987 were evaluable. Results were stratified by the World Health Organization BMI category. Multivariate linear and logistic regression analysis was used to model the operating time, length of stay, positive surgical margins, and noncurable cancer. 
  Results:  Of the 987 patients, 563 (57%) were overweight and 193 (19.6%) were obese. Of the 193 obese patients, 152 (15.4%) had a BMI of 30 to &lt;35 kg/m(2) (class I obesity), 28 (2.8%) a BMI of 35 to &lt;40 kg/m(2) (class II), and 13 (1.3%) a BMI of ≥40 kg/m(2) (class III). No differences were found in the estimated blood loss, complications, PSM, pathologic stage, or biochemical recurrence across the BMI categories (6-month median follow-up). However, pelvic lymph node dissection was more commonly omitted and the nerve-sparing score was inferior in the obese men. On multivariate analysis, a higher BMI was a significant predictor of a longer operating time. 
  Conclusion:  Obese men can safely undergo laparoscopic radical prostatectomy or robot-assisted radical prostatectomy, although the ability to perform excellent nerve sparing appears to decrease with increasing obesity. Nevertheless, obese men can expect perioperative and early oncologic outcomes comparable to those of normal weight men without an increased risk of perioperative complications.

10.1371/journal.pone.0076795  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Protein and antibody arrays have emerged as a promising technology to study protein expression and protein function in a high-throughput manner. These arrays also represent a new opportunity to profile protein expression levels in cancer patients' samples and to identify useful biosignatures for clinical diagnosis, disease classification, prediction, drug development and patient care. We applied antibody arrays to discover a panel of proteins which may serve as biomarkers to distinguish between patients with ovarian cancer and normal controls. 
  Methodology/principal findings:  Using a case-control study design of 34 ovarian cancer patients and 53 age-matched healthy controls, we profiled the expression levels of 174 proteins using antibody array technology and determined the CA125 level using ELISA. The expression levels of those proteins were analyzed using 3 discriminant methods, including artificial neural network, classification tree and split-point score analysis. A panel of 5 serum protein markers (MSP-alpha, TIMP-4, PDGF-R alpha, and OPG and CA125) was identified, which could effectively detect ovarian cancer with high specificity (95%) and high sensitivity (100%), with AUC =0.98, while CA125 alone had an AUC of 0.87. 
  Conclusions/significance:  Our pilot study has shown the promising set of 5 serum markers for ovarian cancer detection.

10.1016/j.urolonc.2012.09.005  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Objectives:  We had previously reported that chronic hypoxia induces androgen-independent growth in the human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. In this study, we have identified a key molecule, the Vav3 oncogene, and investigated the effects of Vav3 overexpression on cancer cell growth and malignant behavior and the possible apoptosis-inducing effect of Vav3 expression knockdown by small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) in LNCaP cells under chronic hypoxia (LNCaP/CH). 
  Methods and materials:  Hypoxia-inducible oncogenes were identified by complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) microarray and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis in order to investigate gene ontology and functional pathways and networks. siRNA was used to knockdown the Vav3 target gene and analyze the effects on proliferation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis of LNCaP/CH cells. Vav3 cDNA was transfected into LNCaP cells under normoxia (LNCaP/N) to establish Vav3-overexpressing clonal cell lines, whose proliferation, invasion, and migration was then examined. Immunoblot analysis was used to investigate the activation of Akt, a Vav3 downstream target molecule. 
  Results:  cDNA microarray analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified Vav3 as a hypoxia-inducible oncogene that was highly associated with malignant behavior. Vav3 messenger RNA and protein expression in LNCaP/CH cells were higher than in LNCaP/N and LNCaP cells cultured under acute hypoxia (LNCaP/AH). The growth rate of LNCaP/CH cells was lower than that of LNCaP/N cells but higher than that of LNCaP/AH cells. LNCaP/CH cells showed higher invasion and migration than LNCaP/N and LNCaP/AH cells. Interrupting Vav3 expression strongly suppressed the proliferation, invasion, and migration of LNCaP/CH cells. Furthermore, siRNA led to apoptosis with increased caspase-3 and cleaved poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase activation in LNCaP/CH cells. Stable Vav3 overexpression in LNCaP cells promoted cell proliferation, invasion, and migration with Akt activation. 
  Conclusions:  Our results demonstrate that Vav3 plays a crucial role in prostate cancer growth and malignant behavior, thus revealing a novel potential therapeutic target.

10.1210/jc.2013-1583  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Objectives:  Robotic total thyroidectomy (TT) with modified radical neck dissection (MRND) using a gasless transaxillary approach has been reported safe and effective in patients with N1b papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), with notable cosmetic benefits when compared with conventional open TT. We have compared oncological outcomes and quality of life (QoL) in PTC patients undergoing robotic TT and MRND and those undergoing conventional open procedures. 
  Materials and methods:  Between March 2010 and July 2011, 128 patients with PTC and lateral neck node metastases underwent TT with MRND, including 62 who underwent robotic and 66 who underwent open TT. We compared oncologic outcomes and safety as well as functional outcomes such as postoperative subjective voice and swallowing difficulties. We also evaluated neck pain, sensory changes, and cosmetic satisfaction after surgery using various QoL symptom scales. Neck and shoulder disability was assessed using arm abduction tests (AAT) and questions from the neck dissection impairment index (NDII). 
  Results:  Although the mean operating time was significantly longer in the robotic (mean, 271.8 ± 50.2 min) than in the open group (mean, 208.9 ± 56.3 min) (P &lt; .0001), postoperative complication rates and oncologic outcomes, including the results of radioactive iodine scans and postoperative serum Tg concentrations, did not differ significantly. Subjective voice outcomes and postoperative AAT and neck dissection impairment index were also similar, but postoperative swallowing difficulties (P = .0041) and sensory changes (P &lt; .0001) were significantly more frequent in the open than in the robotic group. In particular, mean cosmetic satisfaction score was significantly higher in the robotic than in the open group (P &lt; .0001). 
  Conclusions:  Robotic TT with MRND yielded similar oncologic outcomes and safety as conventional open procedures, with similar recovery of neck and shoulder disability. However, the robot technique resulted in better QoL outcomes, including better cosmetic results and reductions in neck sensory changes and swallowing discomfort.

10.1007/s00204-013-1091-8  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   A number of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes are present in food both as natural constituents and as flavouring agents. Their reaction with DNA due to their electrophilic α,β-unsaturated aldehyde moiety may result in genotoxicity as observed in some in vitro models, thereby raising a safety concern. A question that remains is whether in vivo detoxification would be efficient enough to prevent DNA adduct formation and genotoxicity. In this study, a human physiologically based kinetic/dynamic (PBK/D) model of trans-2-hexenal (2-hexenal), a selected model α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, was developed to examine dose-dependent detoxification and DNA adduct formation in humans upon dietary exposure. The kinetic model parameters for detoxification were quantified using relevant pooled human tissue fractions as well as tissue fractions from 11 different individual subjects. In addition, a Monte Carlo simulation was performed so that the impact of interindividual variation in 2-hexenal detoxification on the DNA adduct formation in the population as a whole could be examined. The PBK/D model revealed that DNA adduct formation due to 2-hexenal exposure was 0.039 adducts/10⁸ nucleotides (nt) at the estimated average 2-hexenal dietary intake (0.04 mg 2-hexenal/kg bw) and 0.18 adducts/10⁸ nt at the 95th percentile of the dietary intake (0.178 mg 2-hexenal/kg bw) in the most sensitive people. These levels are three orders of magnitude lower than natural background DNA adduct levels that have been reported in disease-free humans (6.8-110 adducts/10⁸ nt), suggesting that the genotoxicity risk for the human population at realistic dietary daily intakes of 2-hexenal may be negligible.

10.5858/arpa.2011-0550-OA  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Context:  Recently, robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy has replaced open retropubic radical prostatectomy as the surgical procedure of choice. This less-invasive approach offers many advantages but exposes prostate tissue to longer periods of warm ischemia that may affect subsequent analysis of biomarkers. 
  Objective:  To analyze the nucleic acid quality and quantity isolated from open versus laparoscopic prostatectomies. 
  Design:  Nucleic acids were isolated from 10 open-obtained and 10 laparoscopic-obtained tissues stored in our prostate sample repository. Nucleic acid integrity was assessed via electrophoresis and polymerase chain reaction amplification of RNA and DNA targets ranging in size from 125 to 939 base pairs. 
  Results:  The DNA yield, integrity, and polymerase chain reaction amplification were identical between samples obtained from both surgical approaches. The RNA integrity number and yield were similar, as was β-2 microglobulin mRNA amplification up to 652 base pairs. However, 2 of 10 samples (20%) collected robotically showed decreased real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification of prostate-specific antigen messenger RNA, especially with targets larger than 300 base pairs. 
  Conclusions:  Generally, the quality and quantity of nucleic acids isolated from prostate tissue obtained via open or laparoscopic approaches are equivalent, suggesting that procurement of tissues is appropriate from either procedure. However, some loss of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification of larger RNA targets was noted in the laparoscopic samples; appropriate design of assays to keep amplicon sizes small and the use of internal controls to assess RNA integrity is recommended.

10.1016/j.jtcvs.2013.09.010  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Objective:  Robotic-assisted coronary artery bypass grafting has emerged as an alternative to traditional coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous intervention for patients with coronary artery disease. However, the safety and efficacy of this minimally invasive procedure have not been established in large series. 
  Methods:  From October 2009 to September 2012, 307 consecutive robotic-assisted coronary artery bypass grafting procedures were performed at a single US institution by 2 surgeons. Isolated, off-pump, left internal thoracic artery to left anterior descending coronary artery grafting was planned via a 3- to 4-cm non-rib-spreading minithoracotomy after robotic left internal thoracic artery harvest in all patients. Hybrid coronary revascularization was planned in 159 patients (51.8%). Of the 199 angiograms (64.8%) performed before discharge, 63 were performed as completion angiograms in a hybrid suite immediately after left internal thoracic artery-left anterior descending artery grafting. 
  Results:  Thirty-day mortality occurred in 4 patients (1.3%), conversion to sternotomy occurred in 16 patients (5.2%), postoperative myocardial infarction occurred in 5 patients (1.6%), and reexploration for bleeding occurred in 7 patients (2.3%). There was 1 (0.3%) postoperative stroke. For the 199 patients with follow-up angiography before discharge, the left internal thoracic artery was confirmed to be patent (&lt;50% stenosis) in 189 patients (95.0%). Among the 10 patients with significant (≥50% stenosis) defects, 5 had graft occlusion or distal left anterior descending occlusion, 2 had poor flow distal to the anastomosis, and 3 had anastomotic lesions (≥50% stenosis). Among the 63 patients with intraoperative completion angiography, 5 patients underwent surgical graft revision, 3 patients underwent minithoracotomy, and 2 patients underwent conversion to sternotomy. 
  Conclusions:  Robotic-assisted coronary artery bypass grafting is an effective alternative to traditional coronary artery bypass grafting for patients with single or multivessel coronary artery disease, with comparable short-term clinical and angiographic results.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.06.036  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   In this study we investigate systematic patterns of rapidly changing sensor-level interdependencies in resting MEG data obtained from 23 children experiencing reading difficulties (RD) and 27 non-impaired readers (NI). Three-minute MEG time series were band-passed and subjected to blind source separation (BSS) prior to estimating sensor interdependencies using the weighted phase synchronization measure (wPLI). Dynamic sensor-level network properties were then derived for two network metrics (global and local efficiency). The temporal decay of long-range temporal correlations in network metrics (LRTC) was quantified using the scaling exponent (SE) in detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) plots. Having established the reliability of SE estimates as robust descriptors of network dynamics, we found that RD students displayed significantly reduced (a) overall sensor-level network organization across all frequency bands (global efficiency), and (b) temporal correlations between sensors covering the left temporoparietal region and the remaining sensors in the β3 band (local efficiency). Importantly, both groups displayed scale-free global network connectivity dynamics. The direct application of DFA to MEG signals failed to reveal significant group differences. Results are discussed in relation to prior evidence for disrupted temporoparietal functional circuits for reading in developmental reading disability.

10.1037/a0035146  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Temporal integration is the perceptual process combining sensory stimulation over time into longer percepts that can span over 10 times the duration of a minimally detectable stimulus. Particularly in the auditory domain, such "long-term" temporal integration has been characterized as a relatively simple function that acts chiefly to bridge brief input gaps, and which places integrated stimuli on temporal coordinates while preserving their temporal order information. These properties are not observed in visual temporal integration, suggesting they might be modality specific. The present study challenges that view. Participants were presented with rapid series of successive tone stimuli, in which two separate, deviant target tones were to be identified. Critically, the target tone pair would be perceived as a single synthetic vowel if they were interpreted to be simultaneous. During the task, despite that the targets were always sequential and never actually overlapping, listeners frequently reported hearing just one sound, the synthetic vowel, rather than two successive tones. The results demonstrate that auditory temporal integration, like its visual counterpart, truly assembles a percept from sensory inputs across time, and does not just summate time-ordered (identical) inputs or fill gaps therein. This finding supports the idea that temporal integration is a universal function of the human perceptual system.

10.1177/2211068213513453  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Current antiretroviral treatments target multiple pathways important for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) multiplication, including viral entry, synthesis and integration of the DNA provirus, and the processing of viral polyprotein precursors. However, HIV is becoming increasingly resistant to these "combination therapies." Recent findings show that inhibition of HIV Gag protein cleavage into its two structural proteins, matrix (MA) and capsid (CA), has a devastating effect on viral production, revealing a potential new target class for HIV treatment. Unlike the widely used HIV protease inhibitors, this new class of inhibitor would target the substrate, not the protease enzyme itself. This approach offers a distinct advantage in that inhibitors of MA/CA would only need to affect a subset of the Gag molecules to disable viral replication. To discover MA/CA-specific inhibitors, we constructed a modified MA/CA fusion peptide (MA/CAΔ) that contains the HIV protease (PR) cleavage site as well as a tetracysteine motif for fluorescent labeling. The HIV PR cleavage of MA/CAΔ can then be monitored via fluorescence polarization (FP). We have adapted this FP assay for high-throughput screening and validated it according to industry standards using a 384-well plate format. We have currently tested 24,000 compounds in this assay and here detail the screening methodology and the results of this screening campaign.

10.1371/journal.pone.0068385  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   It is widely accepted that long-term changes in synapse structure and function are mediated by rapid activity-dependent gene transcription and new protein synthesis. A growing amount of evidence suggests that the microRNA (miRNA) pathway plays an important role in coordinating these processes. Despite recent advances in this field, there remains a critical need to identify specific activity-regulated miRNAs as well as their key messenger RNA (mRNA) targets. To address these questions, we used the larval Drosophila melanogaster neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a model synapse in which to identify novel miRNA-mediated mechanisms that control activity-dependent synaptic growth. First, we developed a screen to identify miRNAs differentially regulated in the larval CNS following spaced synaptic stimulation. Surprisingly, we identified five miRNAs (miRs-1, -8, -289, -314, and -958) that were significantly downregulated by activity. Neuronal misexpression of three miRNAs (miRs-8, -289, and -958) suppressed activity-dependent synaptic growth suggesting that these miRNAs control the translation of biologically relevant target mRNAs. Functional annotation cluster analysis revealed that putative targets of miRs-8 and -289 are significantly enriched in clusters involved in the control of neuronal processes including axon development, pathfinding, and growth. In support of this, miR-8 regulated the expression of a wingless 3'UTR (wg 3' untranslated region) reporter in vitro. Wg is an important presynaptic regulatory protein required for activity-dependent axon terminal growth at the fly NMJ. In conclusion, our results are consistent with a model where key activity-regulated miRNAs are required to coordinate the expression of genes involved in activity-dependent synaptogenesis.

10.1016/j.pain.2013.08.023  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Neuronal plasticity in the pain-processing pathway is thought to be a mechanism underlying pain hypersensitivity and negative emotions occurring during a pain state. Recent evidence suggests that the activation of astrocytes in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) contributes to the development of negative emotions during pain hypersensitivity after peripheral inflammation. However, it is unknown whether these activated astrocytes contribute to neuronal plasticity in the ACC. In this study, by using optical imaging with voltage- and Ca(2+)-sensitive dyes, we examined the long-term facilitation of neuronal excitation induced by high-frequency conditioning stimulation (HFS) in ACC slices of control mice and mice with peripheral inflammation induced by the injection of complete Freund adjuvant (CFA) to the hind paw. Immunoreactivity of glial fibrillary acidic protein in laminae II-III of the ACC in the CFA-injected mice was higher than in the control mice. Neuronal excitation in ACC slices from the CFA-injected mice was gradually increased by HFS, and the magnitude of this long-term facilitation was greater than in the control mice. The long-term facilitation in the CFA-injected mice was inhibited by the astroglial toxin, the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist and NMDA receptor glycine binding site antagonist. The increase of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration in astrocytes during HFS was higher in the CFA-injected mice than in the control mice and was inhibited by l-α-aminoadipate (l-α-AA). These results suggest that the activation of astrocytes in the ACC plays a crucial role in the development of negative emotions and LTP during pain hypersensitivity after peripheral inflammation.

10.1016/j.cmpb.2013.03.005  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a bacterium responsible for a wide spectrum of illnesses. The surface of the bacterium consists of three distinctive membranes: plasmatic, cellular and the polysaccharide (PS) capsule. PS capsules may mediate several biological processes, particularly invasive infections of human beings. Prevention against pneumococcal related illnesses can be provided by vaccines. There is a sound investment worldwide in the investigation of a proteic antigen as a possible alternative to pneumococcal vaccines based exclusively on PS. A few proteins which are part of the membrane of the pneumococcus seem to have antigen potential to be part of a vaccine, particularly the PspA. A vital aspect in the production of the intended conjugate pneumococcal vaccine is the efficient production (in industrial scale) of both, the chosen PS serotypes as well as the PspA protein. Growing recombinant Escherichia coli (rE. coli) in high-cell density cultures (HCDC) under a fed-batch regime requires a refined continuous control over various process variables where the on-line prediction of the feeding phase is of particular relevance and one of the focuses of this paper. The viability of an on-line monitoring software system, based on constructive neural networks (CoNN), for automatically detecting the time to start the fed-phase of a HCDC of rE. coli that contains a plasmid used for PspA expression is investigated. The paper describes the data and methodology used for training five different types of CoNNs, four of them suitable for classification tasks and one suitable for regression tasks, aiming at comparatively investigate both approaches. Results of software simulations implementing five CoNN algorithms as well as conventional neural networks (FFNN), decision trees (DT) and support vector machines (SVM) are also presented and discussed. A modified CasCor algorithm, implementing a data softening process, has shown to be an efficient candidate to be part of an on-line HCDC monitoring system for detecting the feeding phase of the HCDC process.

10.1016/j.ejso.2013.03.007  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Objective:  To assess operative and pathological results obtained after robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) in renal masses over 4 cm. 
  Patients and methods:  Between 2007 and 2011, 220 robotic nephron-sparing surgeries (NSS) were performed at six French urology departments. Data were prospectively collected: age, BMI, pre and post-operative eGFR (MDRD), operative time (OT), warm ischemia time (WIT), estimated blood loss (EBL), length of hospital stay (LOS), Clavien complications, pathological results and oncologic outcome. Tumor complexity was assessed according to the RENAL nephrometry score. 
  Results:  Overall, 54 tumors were included. Median follow up was 26 months. Median age at surgery was 62 years. Median RENAL nephrometry score was 7 (4-10). Median WIT was 23 min (10-59). Median OT and EBL were 180 min (110-425) and 100 cc (0-2500). Blood transfusion occurred in 7 cases (13%). Median tumor size was 45 mm (40-70). Three patients had positive surgical margins. Median LOS was 5 days (2-28). Nine patients presented post-operative complications of which 1/3 were considered as major (Clavien IIIb). Median pre-operative and post-operative eGFR was 88 (36-136) and 75 ml/min (33-122) (p = 0.01), respectively. Two patients developed subsequent metastasis. The 2-year progression free survival (PFS) rate was 90.5%. 
  Conclusion:  Our results confirm that RAPN is a useful and acceptable approach for renal masses greater than 4 cm in size. When technically possible, NSS provides promising short-term cancer-specific survival rates with acceptable morbidity. Tumor size is not sufficiently discriminant enough and RENAL nephrometry score should increasingly used to describe tumor complexity.

10.1002/emmm.201302848  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Down syndrome (trisomy 21) is the most common viable chromosomal disorder with intellectual impairment and several other developmental abnormalities. Here, we report the generation and characterization of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from monozygotic twins discordant for trisomy 21 in order to eliminate the effects of the variability of genomic background. The alterations observed by genetic analysis at the iPSC level and at first approximation in early development illustrate the developmental disease transcriptional signature of Down syndrome. Moreover, we observed an abnormal neural differentiation of Down syndrome iPSCs in vivo when formed teratoma in NOD-SCID mice, and in vitro when differentiated into neuroprogenitors and neurons. These defects were associated with changes in the architecture and density of neurons, astroglial and oligodendroglial cells together with misexpression of genes involved in neurogenesis, lineage specification and differentiation. Furthermore, we provide novel evidence that dual-specificity tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) on chromosome 21 likely contributes to these defects. Importantly, we found that targeting DYRK1A pharmacologically or by shRNA results in a considerable correction of these defects.

10.1055/s-0033-1335728  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Purpose:  The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of sonographic pattern recognition by experts, a standardized morphological scoring system, the risk malignancy index (RMI) and CA 125 assay for the preoperative assessment of ovarian lesions in premenopausal patients. 
  Material and methods:  Diagnostic work-up of 1320 patients who underwent surgical exploration due to an adnexal mass at a tertiary referral center were included. We assessed the discriminative value of pattern recognition, a sonographic morphological scoring system, RMI and CA 125 by calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and Cohen's kappa for each diagnostic approach while using histopathology as the reference standard. 
  Results:  Pattern recognition showed the highest discriminative power with an observed kappa of 0.53. Sensitivity and specificity yielded 0.76 and 0.97 respectively. Combining pattern recognition with CA 125 serum measurement in the context of a triage system diminished the diagnostic value (kappa: 0.24; sensitivity: 0.29 specificity: 0.97). For the RMI we observed a sensitivity of 0.54 and a specificity of 0.96 and estimated kappa value yielded 0.37. Omitting the CA 125 assay and using a morphological sonographic assessment system increased the kappa value to 0.45 with sensitivity and specificity observed at 0.61 and 0.97 respectively. 
  Conclusion:  Expert pattern recognition was found to be the method with the highest discriminative power in assessing an adnexal mass during premenopause. Additional assessment of serum CA 125 diminished the diagnostic accuracy. Standardized morphological sonographic assessment resulted in a moderate diagnostic accuracy. Supplementing the morphological sonographic assessment with CA 125 by using the RMI algorithm did not improve the diagnostic value.

10.1016/j.actbio.2013.06.027  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Aseptic loosening of total joint replacements is driven by the reaction of macrophages to foreign body particles released from the implant. It was hypothesized that the macrophages' response to these particles is dependent, in addition to particle characteristics and contaminating biomolecules, on the state of macrophage polarization as determined by the local cytokine microenvironment. To test this hypothesis we differentiated M1 and M2 macrophages from human peripheral blood monocytes and compared their responses to titanium particles using genome-wide microarray analysis and a multiplex cytokine assay. In comparison to non-activated M0 macrophages, the overall chemotactic and inflammatory responses to titanium particles were greatly enhanced in M1 macrophages and effectively suppressed in M2 macrophages. In addition, the genome-wide approach revealed several novel, potentially osteolytic, particle-induced mediators, and signaling pathway analysis suggested the involvement of toll-like and nod-like receptor signaling in particle recognition. It is concluded that the magnitude of foreign body reaction caused by titanium particles is dependent on the state of macrophage polarization. Thus, by limiting the action of M1 polarizing factors, e.g. bacterial biofilm formation, in peri-implant tissues and promoting M2 macrophage polarization by biomaterial solutions or pharmacologically, it might be possible to restrict wear-particle-induced inflammation and osteolysis.

10.1111/ppl.12088  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] is a non-essential metal for normal plants and is toxic to plants at high concentrations. However, signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms of its action on cell function and gene expression remain elusive. In this study, we found that Cr(VI) induced endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and Ca(2+) accumulation and activated NADPH oxidase and calcium-dependent protein kinase. We investigated global transcriptional changes in rice roots by microarray analysis. Gene expression profiling indicated activation of abscisic acid-, ethylene- and jasmonic acid-mediated signaling and inactivation of gibberellic acid-related pathways in Cr(VI) stress-treated rice roots. Genes encoding signaling components such as the protein kinases domain of unknown function 26, receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, LRK10-like kinase type 2 and protein phosphatase 2C, as well as transcription factors WRKY and apetala2/ethylene response factor were predominant during Cr(VI) stress. Genes involved in vesicle trafficking were subjected to functional characterization. Pretreating rice roots with a vesicle trafficking inhibitor, brefeldin A, effectively reduced Cr(VI)-induced ROS production. Suppression of the vesicle trafficking gene, Exo70, by virus-induced gene silencing strategies revealed that vesicle trafficking is required for mediation of Cr(VI)-induced ROS production. Taken together, these findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms in signaling pathways and transcriptional regulation in response to Cr stress in plants.

10.1007/s00213-013-3290-7  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Rationale:  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder with onset during early childhood and typically a life-long course. The majority of ASD cases stems from complex, 'multiple-hit', oligogenic/polygenic underpinnings involving several loci and possibly gene-environment interactions. These multiple layers of complexity spur interest into the identification of biomarkers able to define biologically homogeneous subgroups, predict autism risk prior to the onset of behavioural abnormalities, aid early diagnoses, predict the developmental trajectory of ASD children, predict response to treatment and identify children at risk for severe adverse reactions to psychoactive drugs. 
  Objectives:  The present paper reviews (a) similarities and differences between the concepts of 'biomarker' and 'endophenotype', (b) established biomarkers and endophenotypes in autism research (biochemical, morphological, hormonal, immunological, neurophysiological and neuroanatomical, neuropsychological, behavioural), (c) -omics approaches towards the discovery of novel biomarker panels for ASD, (d) bioresource infrastructures and (e) data management for biomarker research in autism. 
  Results:  Known biomarkers, such as abnormal blood levels of serotonin, oxytocin, melatonin, immune cytokines and lymphocyte subtypes, multiple neuropsychological, electrophysiological and brain imaging parameters, will eventually merge with novel biomarkers identified using unbiased genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic methods, to generate multimarker panels. Bioresource infrastructures, data management and data analysis using artificial intelligence networks will be instrumental in supporting efforts to identify these biomarker panels. 
  Conclusions:  Biomarker research has great heuristic potential in targeting autism diagnosis and treatment.

10.1104/pp.113.222588  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Complete submergence represses photosynthesis and aerobic respiration, causing rapid mortality in most terrestrial plants. However, some plants have evolved traits allowing them to survive prolonged flooding, such as species of the genus Rorippa, close relatives of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We studied plant survival, changes in carbohydrate and metabolite concentrations, and transcriptome responses to submergence of two species, Rorippa sylvestris and Rorippa amphibia. We exploited the close relationship between Rorippa species and the model species Arabidopsis by using Arabidopsis GeneChip microarrays for whole-genome transcript profiling of roots of young plants exposed to a 24-h submergence treatment or air. A probe mask was used based on hybridization of genomic DNA of both species to the arrays, so that weak probe signals due to Rorippa species/Arabidopsis mismatches were removed. Furthermore, we compared Rorippa species microarray results with those obtained for roots of submerged Arabidopsis plants. Both Rorippa species could tolerate deep submergence, with R. sylvestris surviving much longer than R. amphibia. Submergence resulted in the induction of genes involved in glycolysis and fermentation and the repression of many energy-consuming pathways, similar to the low-oxygen and submergence response of Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa). The qualitative responses of both Rorippa species to submergence appeared roughly similar but differed quantitatively. Notably, glycolysis and fermentation genes and a gene encoding sucrose synthase were more strongly induced in the less tolerant R. amphibia than in R. sylvestris. A comparison with Arabidopsis microarray studies on submerged roots revealed some interesting differences and potential tolerance-related genes in Rorippa species.

10.1007/s00268-012-1881-9  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  The St. Gallen consensus provides treatment recommendations for breast cancer based on prognostic factors. Although many patients' prognostic patterns are not easily matched with the prognostic patterns listed in the St. Gallen consensus, there has been no systematic investigation reporting the gap between treatment recommendations and actual postoperative treatment choices in clinical practice. 
  Methods:  Four hundred seventy-one patients with hormone receptor-positive [HR(+)] and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2-negative [HER2(-)] breast cancer were analyzed. These patients were classified into either the "crisp treatment group" or "fuzzy treatment group" based on the definitiveness of postoperative treatment selection based on St. Gallen treatment recommendations. The patients in the fuzzy treatment group were further classified into strata in which patients within each stratum shared the same prognostic factor patterns with similar recurrence rates. 
  Results:  A total of 87.3% of HR(+)HER2(-) patients were designated to the fuzzy treatment group. Four prognostic strata were constructed according to the survival tree model, and revealed that patients with poor prognostic profiles tended to receive endocrine therapy with chemotherapy. This suggests that postoperative chemotherapy is useful, although there was no statistical significance. 
  Conclusions:  We constructed prognostic profiles of patients in the fuzzy treatment group and examined the recurrence rates associated with two treatment regimens within each prognostic profile. These findings are exploratory, but they may be useful for planning prospective studies of the effectiveness of postoperative treatment regimens among patients with a heterogeneous combination of prognostic factors.

Intracellular Ca(2+) levels increased rapidly and dose-dependently upon glucose stimulation, accompanied with about threefold rapid increases in cellular stiffness. Subsequently, cellular stiffness diminished rapidly and settled at a value about twofold of the baseline. Capsaicin caused a similar transient increase in intracellular Ca(2+) changes. However, cellular stiffness increased gradually to about twofold until leveling off. The current study characterizes for the first time the biophysical properties underlying glucose-induced biphasic responses of insulin secretion, distinctive from the slow and single-phased stiffness response to capsaicin despite similar changes in intracellular Ca(2+) levels. The integrated AFM nanorobotics and optical investigation enables the fine dissection of mechano-property from ion channel activities in response to specific and non-specific agonist stimulation, providing novel biomechanical markers for the insulin secretion process.

This protection is known to be mediated in part by antigen-specific memory CD8(+) T cells, presumably those residing in the liver. We characterized and compared the transcriptional profile of parasite-specific memory CD8(+) T cells residing in the liver and spleen after immunization of mice with irradiated sporozoites. Microarray-based expression analysis of these memory CD8(+) T cells indicated that liver-resident memory cells display a distinct gene expression profile. We found major differences in the expression of immune function genes as well as genes involved in the cell cycle, cell trafficking, transcription and intracellular signaling. Importantly, the malaria parasite-induced liver-resident CD8(+) T cells display a transcriptional profile different to that described for CD8(+) T cells following other microbial challenges.

10.1007/s10637-013-9974-3  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Low-dose metronomic chemotherapy is an emerging form of chemotherapy with distinct mechanisms of action from conventional chemotherapy (e.g., antiangiogenesis). Although developed to overcome resistance to conventional chemotherapy, metronomic chemotherapy is subject to resistance on its own. However, there is a paucity of information on mechanisms of resistance, on cross-resistance between metronomic regimens using different cytotoxic drugs, and on cross-resistance between metronomic versus conventional chemotherapy, or versus targeted antiangiogenic therapy. Herein we show that PC-3 human prostate cancer xenografts were sensitive to both metronomic cyclophosphamide and metronomic docetaxel, but resistant to metronomic topotecan. Conventional docetaxel was only moderately active in parental PC-3 and in metronomic cyclophosphamide resistant PC-3 tumors. However, in metronomic cyclophosphamide resistant PC-3 tumors combining conventional docetaxel or bolus cyclophosphamide therapy with continued metronomic cyclophosphamide was superior to each treatment alone. Furthermore, bevacizumab had single-agent activity against metronomic cyclophosphamide resistant PC-3 tumors. Microarray analyses identified altered regulation of protein translation as a potential mechanism of resistance to metronomic cyclophosphamide. Our results suggest that sensitivity to metronomic chemotherapy regimens using different cytotoxic drugs not only depends on shared mechanisms of action such as antiangiogenesis, but also on as yet unknown additional antitumor effects that appear to be drug-specific. As clinically observed with targeted antiangiogenic agents, the continued use of metronomic chemotherapy beyond progression may amplify the effects of added second-line therapies or vice versa. However, metronomic chemotherapy is no different from other systemic therapies in that predictive biomarkers will be essential to fully exploit this novel use of conventional chemotherapeutics.

10.1016/j.jtcvs.2013.09.035  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Objective:  The study objective was to review our first 300 consecutive robotic-assisted mitral repairs performed from June 2005 to October 2012 and to compare the surgical outcomes of our previously reported initial 120 cases with the subsequent 180 procedures. 
  Methods:  Our initial 120 robotic-assisted mitral repairs were previously reported, and we now compare our early experience with the recent 180 consecutive procedures for a total of 300 robotic-assisted mitral repairs. There was no patient selection. Every patient in need of isolated mitral valve repair underwent this procedure. All patients received an annuloplasty band and 1 or more of the following: leaflet resection, secondary chordal transposition, or polytetrafluoroethylene neochordal replacement and edge-to-edge repair. 
  Results:  All 300 patients had preoperative echocardiographic findings of severe mitral regurgitation. There were no differences (P = not significant) between the initial and the recent cohorts for preoperative characteristics, including age (58.4 ± 10.5 years vs 59.9 years), female gender (35.8% vs 36.1%), ejection fraction (61.9% vs 60.6%), congestive heart failure (35.0% vs 36.7%), creatinine (0.94 mg/dL vs 0.98 mg/dL), and New York Heart Association class. The incidence of anterior and posterior leaflet prolapse was similar in both groups, whereas Barlow syndrome was higher in group 2 (5.8% vs 27.8%). There was 1 (0.33%) hospital mortality and no deaths in the last 180 cases. Overall, 8 patients (2.7%) required subsequent mitral valve replacement via a median sternotomy, 6 (5.0%) in the first group and 2 (1.1%) in the second group (P = .06). One patient in each group had mitral valve re-repair through a right mini-thoracotomy, and 1 patient in the first group required a mitral valve replacement via a mini-thoracotomy during the original procedure. Two of the 180 patients had documented cerebrovascular accident, but both fully recovered clinically. There was no cerebrovascular accident in the last 120 patients. Crossclamp times decreased from 116 minutes to 91 minutes in the second group despite starting a training program with a junior associate performing part of the procedure at the console in the last 100 cases. Post-pump echocardiograms showed no/trace mitral regurgitation in 86.1% of the last 180 patients and mild mitral regurgitation in 11.1%. Follow-up echocardiography for the last 180 patients from 1 month to more than 1 year showed no/trace mitral regurgitation in 64.6% of patients and mild mitral regurgitation in 23.1% of patients. Seven patients (10.8%) had moderate mitral regurgitation, and 1 patient (1.5%) had severe mitral regurgitation. 
  Conclusions:  The majority of complications and reoperations occurred early in our experience, especially using the first-generation da Vinci robot (Intuitive Surgical Inc, Sunnyvale, Calif). The newer da Vinci Si HD system with the addition of an adjustable left atrial roof retractor together with increased experience has made robotic-assisted mitral repair of all types of degenerative mitral valve pathology reproducible. The training of young surgeons in a stepwise fashion in high-volume centers will help to avoid the complications encountered during the introduction of this technology.

Although the increased plastid compartment size has been thought to largely attribute to the enhanced pigmentation, the molecular aspects of how the HP1/DDB1 gene manipulates plastid biogenesis and development are largely unknown. In the present study, we compared transcriptome profiles of immature fruit pericarp tissue between tomato cv. Ailsa Craig (WT) and its isogenic hp1 mutant. Over 20 million sequence reads, representing &gt; 1.6 Gb sequence data per sample, were generated and assembled into 21,972 and 22,167 gene models in WT and hp1, respectively, accounting for over 60 % official gene models in both samples. Subsequent analyses revealed that 8,322 and 7,989 alternative splicing events, 8833 or 8510 extended 5'-UTRs, 8,263 or 8,939 extended 3'-UTRs, and 1,136 and 1,133 novel transcripts, exist in WT and hp1, respectively. Significant differences in expression level of 880 genes were detected between the WT and hp1, many of which are involved in signaling transduction, transcription regulation and biotic and abiotic stresses response. Distinctly, RNA-seq datasets, quantitative RT-PCR analyses demonstrate that, in hp1 mutant pericarp tissue at early developmental stage, an apparent expression alteration was found in several regulators directly involved in plastid division and development. These results provide a useful reference for a more accurate and more detailed characterization of the molecular process in the development and pigmentation of tomato fruits.

10.1186/1476-4598-12-59  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Prolactin (PRL) is essential for normal mammary gland development. PRL promotes mammary tumor formation in rodents and elevated serum prolactin is associated with increased risk of estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer in women. On the other hand, PRL may also exert pro-differentiation effects and act to suppress invasive features of established breast cancer. Previously published limited global transcript profiling analyses of prolactin-regulated gene expression in human breast cancer cells have exclusively been performed in vitro. The present study aimed to shed new light on how PRL modulates estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer through global transcript profiling of a human breast cancer xenograft model in vivo. 
  Methods:  The prolactin-responsive human T47D breast cancer cell line was xenotransplanted into nude mice and global transcript profiling was carried out following treatment with or without human PRL for 48 h. A subset of PRL-modulated transcripts was further validated using qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. 
  Results:  The in vivo analyses identified 130 PRL-modulated transcripts, 75 upregulated and 55 downregulated, based on fold change &gt;1.6 and P-value &lt;0.05. From this initial panel of transcripts, a subset of 18 transcripts with established breast cancer-relevance were selected and validated by qRT-PCR. Some but not all of the transcripts were also PRL-modulated in vitro. The selected PRL-modulated transcripts were tested for dependence on Stat5, Jak1 or Jak2 activation, and for co-regulation by 17β-estradiol (E2). The protein encoded by one of the PRL-regulated transcripts, PTHrP, was examined in a panel of 92 human breast cancers and found by in situ quantitative immunofluorescence analysis to be highly positively correlated with nuclear localized and tyrosine phosphorylated Stat5. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that PRL-upregulated genes were enriched in pathways involved in differentiation. Finally, a gene signature based on PRL-upregulated genes was associated with prolonged relapse-free and metastasis-free survival in breast cancer patients. 
  Conclusions:  This global analysis identified and validated a panel of PRL-modulated transcripts in an ER-positive human breast cancer xenotransplant model, which may have value as markers of relapse-free and metastasis-free survival. Gene products identified in the present study may facilitate ongoing deciphering of the pleiotropic effects of PRL on human breast cancer.

10.1002/lary.22172  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Objectives/hypothesis:  To determine the prognostic influence of p16(INK4a) immunohistochemistry on the survival of resectable oropharyngeal carcinomas (OPSCC). 
  Study design:  Retrospective pathologic evaluation of a prospective single-arm cohort study at a tertiary referral center. 
  Methods:  There were 48 patients with resectable OPSCC who consented for transoral robotic surgery (TORS) and banked tissue specimen for assessment. TORS was with or without adjuvant radiation or chemoradiation. Main outcome measures were p16(INK4a) status, human papillomavirus status, local-regional disease control, and overall, disease-specific, and disease-free survival. 
  Results:  p16(INK4a) and HPV positivity were identified in 73% and 74% of patients respectively. With a median follow-up of 38.8 months (2.5-63.3 months), only one local-regional relapse has occurred in both the p16(INK4a)-positive and p16(INK4a) -negative cohorts. No disease-specific, disease-free, and overall survival differences were observed between p16(INK4a) -positive and p16(INK4a)-negative patients (P = .446, P = .277, P = .643, respectively). 
  Conclusions:  p16(INK4a) was not prognostic in resectable OPSCC when treated with an initial TORS approach.

However, these techniques are poorly suited for complicated fistulas. Here, we present a novel minimally invasive procedure: robotic-assisted laparoscopic segmental resection with rectoanal anastomosis for the management of difficult RUFs. This novel technique may be valuable in the treatment of recurrent or complex RUFs.

  Methods:  This was a retrospective review of 10 patients followed over a 5-year period at a single tertiary academic medical center. Patient, tumor, clinicopathologic, functional, and oncologic outcomes were collected and analyzed. 
  Results:  All cancers treated were either T1 (40%) or T2 (60%). Negative margins were achieved in all patients. Four patients received adjuvant radiation therapy (40%). No patients experienced surgical complications and all had excellent functional outcomes. Mean follow-up was 24 months (range, 2-60 months) with locoregional and distant control achieved in 8 patients (80%) and 9 patients (90%), respectively. 
  Conclusions:  Minor salivary malignancies of the oropharynx are a surgical disease. Short-term follow-up data demonstrate feasibility, low morbidity, good functional, and oncologic results for TORS management of these malignancies.

10.1007/978-3-642-40811-3_13  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   We present a method to detect epileptic regions based on functional connectivity differences between individual epilepsy patients and a healthy population. Our model assumes that the global functional characteristics of these differences are shared across patients, but it allows for the epileptic regions to vary between individuals. We evaluate the detection performance against intracranial EEG observations and compare our approach with two baseline methods that use standard statistics. The baseline techniques are sensitive to the choice of thresholds, whereas our algorithm automatically estimates the appropriate model parameters and compares favorably with the best baseline results. This suggests the promise of our approach for pre-surgical planning in epilepsy.

10.1177/1087057113495296  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Reactivation of genes normally expressed during organogenesis is a characteristic of kidney regeneration. Enhancing this reactivation could potentially be a therapeutic target to augment kidney regeneration. The inductive events that drive kidney organogenesis in zebrafish are similar to the initial steps in mammalian kidney organogenesis. Therefore, quantifying embryonic signals that drive zebrafish kidney development is an attractive strategy for the discovery of potential novel therapeutic modalities that accelerate kidney regeneration. The Lim1 homeobox protein, Lhx1, is a marker of kidney development that is also expressed in the regenerating kidneys after injury. Using a fluorescent Lhx1a-EGFP transgene whose phenotype faithfully recapitulates that of the endogenous protein, we developed a high-content assay for Lhx1a-EGFP expression in transgenic zebrafish embryos employing an artificial intelligence-based image analysis method termed cognition network technology (CNT). Implementation of the CNT assay on high-content readers enabled automated real-time in vivo time-course, dose-response, and variability studies in the developing embryo. The Lhx1a assay was complemented with a kidney-specific secondary CNT assay that enables direct measurements of the embryonic renal tubule cell population. The integration of fluorescent transgenic zebrafish embryos with automated imaging and artificial intelligence-based image analysis provides an in vivo analysis system for structure-activity relationship studies and de novo discovery of novel agents that augment innate regenerative processes.

10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.06.015  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Recent evidence has shown that humans are remarkably sensitive to artificial cues of conspecific observation when making decisions with potential social consequences. Whether similar effects are found in other great apes has not yet been investigated. We carried out two experiments in which individual chimpanzees, <i>Pan troglodytes</i>, took items of food from an array in the presence of either an image of a large conspecific face or a scrambled control image. In experiment 1 we compared three versions of the face image varying in size and the amount of the face displayed. In experiment 2 we compared a fourth variant of the image with more prominent coloured eyes displayed closer to the focal chimpanzee. The chimpanzees did not look at the face images significantly more than at the control images in either experiment. Although there were trends for some individuals in each experiment to be slower to take high-value food items in the face conditions, these were not consistent or robust. We suggest that the extreme human sensitivity to cues of potential conspecific observation may not be shared with chimpanzees.

10.1016/j.biosystems.2013.07.001  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The development of increasingly popular multiobjective metaheuristics has allowed bioinformaticians to deal with optimization problems in computational biology where multiple objective functions must be taken into account. One of the most relevant research topics that can benefit from these techniques is phylogenetic inference. Throughout the years, different researchers have proposed their own view about the reconstruction of ancestral evolutionary relationships among species. As a result, biologists often report different phylogenetic trees from a same dataset when considering distinct optimality principles. In this work, we detail a multiobjective swarm intelligence approach based on the novel Artificial Bee Colony algorithm for inferring phylogenies. The aim of this paper is to propose a complementary view of phylogenetics according to the maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood criteria, in order to generate a set of phylogenetic trees that represent a compromise between these principles. Experimental results on a variety of nucleotide data sets and statistical studies highlight the relevance of the proposal with regard to other multiobjective algorithms and state-of-the-art biological methods.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.05.049  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   We present an extension of the Linear Mixed Effects (LME) modeling approach to be applied to the mass-univariate analysis of longitudinal neuroimaging (LNI) data. The proposed method, called spatiotemporal LME or ST-LME, builds on the flexible LME framework and exploits the spatial structure in image data. We instantiated ST-LME for the analysis of cortical surface measurements (e.g. thickness) computed by FreeSurfer, a widely-used brain Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) analysis software package. We validate the proposed ST-LME method and provide a quantitative and objective empirical comparison with two popular alternative methods, using two brain MRI datasets obtained from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS). Our experiments revealed that ST-LME offers a dramatic gain in statistical power and repeatability of findings, while providing good control of the false positive rate.

10.1118/1.4771931  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Purpose:  To develop a real-time automatic method for tracking implanted radiographic markers in low-contrast cine-MV patient images used in image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT). 
  Methods:  Intrafraction motion tracking using radiotherapy beam-line MV images have gained some attention recently in IGRT because no additional imaging dose is introduced. However, MV images have much lower contrast than kV images, therefore a robust and automatic algorithm for marker detection in MV images is a prerequisite. Previous marker detection methods are all based on template matching or its derivatives. Template matching needs to match object shape that changes significantly for different implantation and projection angle. While these methods require a large number of templates to cover various situations, they are often forced to use a smaller number of templates to reduce the computation load because their methods all require exhaustive search in the region of interest. The authors solve this problem by synergetic use of modern but well-tested computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques; specifically the authors detect implanted markers utilizing discriminant analysis for initialization and use mean-shift feature space analysis for sequential tracking. This novel approach avoids exhaustive search by exploiting the temporal correlation between consecutive frames and makes it possible to perform more sophisticated detection at the beginning to improve the accuracy, followed by ultrafast sequential tracking after the initialization. The method was evaluated and validated using 1149 cine-MV images from two prostate IGRT patients and compared with manual marker detection results from six researchers. The average of the manual detection results is considered as the ground truth for comparisons. 
  Results:  The average root-mean-square errors of our real-time automatic tracking method from the ground truth are 1.9 and 2.1 pixels for the two patients (0.26 mm/pixel). The standard deviations of the results from the 6 researchers are 2.3 and 2.6 pixels. The proposed framework takes about 128 ms to detect four markers in the first MV images and about 23 ms to track these markers in each of the subsequent images. 
  Conclusions:  The unified framework for tracking of multiple markers presented here can achieve marker detection accuracy similar to manual detection even in low-contrast cine-MV images. It can cope with shape deformations of fiducial markers at different gantry angles. The fast processing speed reduces the image processing portion of the system latency, therefore can improve the performance of real-time motion compensation.

10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2013.03.017  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Rosen classified sciences into two categories: formalizable and unformalizable. Whereas formalizable sciences expressed in terms of mathematical theories were highly valued by Rutherford, Hutchins pointed out that unformalizable parts of soft sciences are of genuine interest and importance. Attempts to build mathematical theories for biology in the past century was met with modest and sporadic successes, and only in simple systems. In this article, a qualitative model of humans' high creativity is presented as a starting point to consider whether the gap between soft and hard sciences is bridgeable. Simonton's chance-configuration theory, which mimics the process of evolution, was modified and improved. By treating problem solving as a process of pattern recognition, the known dichotomy of visual thinking vs. verbal thinking can be recast in terms of analog pattern recognition (non-algorithmic process) and digital pattern recognition (algorithmic process), respectively. Additional concepts commonly encountered in computer science, operations research and artificial intelligence were also invoked: heuristic searching, parallel and sequential processing. The refurbished chance-configuration model is now capable of explaining several long-standing puzzles in human cognition: a) why novel discoveries often came without prior warning, b) why some creators had no ideas about the source of inspiration even after the fact, c) why some creators were consistently luckier than others, and, last but not least, d) why it was so difficult to explain what intuition, inspiration, insight, hunch, serendipity, etc. are all about. The predictive power of the present model was tested by means of resolving Zeno's paradox of Achilles and the Tortoise after one deliberately invoked visual thinking. Additional evidence of its predictive power must await future large-scale field studies. The analysis was further generalized to constructions of scientific theories in general. This approach is in line with Campbell's evolutionary epistemology. Instead of treating science as immutable Natural Laws, which already existed and which were just waiting to be discovered, scientific theories are regarded as humans' mental constructs, which must be invented to reconcile with observed natural phenomena. In this way, the pursuit of science is shifted from diligent and systematic (or random) searching for existing Natural Laws to firing up humans' imagination to comprehend Nature's behavioral pattern. The insights gained in understanding human creativity indicated that new mathematics that is capable of handling effectively parallel processing and human subjectivity is sorely needed. The past classification of formalizability vs. non-formalizability was made in reference to contemporary mathematics. Rosen's conclusion did not preclude future inventions of new biology-friendly mathematics.

10.1186/1752-0509-7-43  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Systems Biology develops computational models in order to understand biological phenomena. The increasing number and complexity of such "bio-models" necessitate computer support for the overall modelling task. Computer-aided modelling has to be based on a formal semantic description of bio-models. But, even if computational bio-models themselves are represented precisely in terms of mathematical expressions their full meaning is not yet formally specified and only described in natural language. 
  Results:  We present a conceptual framework - the meaning facets - which can be used to rigorously specify the semantics of bio-models. A bio-model has a dual interpretation: On the one hand it is a mathematical expression which can be used in computational simulations (intrinsic meaning). On the other hand the model is related to the biological reality (extrinsic meaning). We show that in both cases this interpretation should be performed from three perspectives: the meaning of the model's components (structure), the meaning of the model's intended use (function), and the meaning of the model's dynamics (behaviour). In order to demonstrate the strengths of the meaning facets framework we apply it to two semantically related models of the cell cycle. Thereby, we make use of existing approaches for computer representation of bio-models as much as possible and sketch the missing pieces. 
  Conclusions:  The meaning facets framework provides a systematic in-depth approach to the semantics of bio-models. It can serve two important purposes: First, it specifies and structures the information which biologists have to take into account if they build, use and exchange models. Secondly, because it can be formalised, the framework is a solid foundation for any sort of computer support in bio-modelling. The proposed conceptual framework establishes a new methodology for modelling in Systems Biology and constitutes a basis for computer-aided collaborative research.

These models exploit the optical transparency of zebrafish larvae and the availability of a large genetic tool box. Here we present detailed protocols for the robotic injection of zebrafish embryos at very high accuracy with a speed of up to 2000 embryos per hour. These protocols are benchmarked for several applications: (1) the injection of DNA for obtaining transgenic animals, (2) the injection of antisense morpholinos that can be used for gene knock-down, (3) the injection of microbes for studying infectious disease, and (4) the injection of human cancer cells as a model for tumor progression. We show examples of how the injected embryos can be screened at high-throughput level using fluorescence analysis. Our methods open up new avenues for the use of zebrafish larvae for large compound screens in the search for new medicines.

10.1093/molbev/mst099  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   The recent explosion in available genetic data has led to significant advances in understanding the demographic histories of and relationships among human populations. It is still a challenge, however, to infer reliable parameter values for complicated models involving many populations. Here, we present MixMapper, an efficient, interactive method for constructing phylogenetic trees including admixture events using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data. MixMapper implements a novel two-phase approach to admixture inference using moment statistics, first building an unadmixed scaffold tree and then adding admixed populations by solving systems of equations that express allele frequency divergences in terms of mixture parameters. Importantly, all features of the model, including topology, sources of gene flow, branch lengths, and mixture proportions, are optimized automatically from the data and include estimates of statistical uncertainty. MixMapper also uses a new method to express branch lengths in easily interpretable drift units. We apply MixMapper to recently published data for Human Genome Diversity Cell Line Panel individuals genotyped on a SNP array designed especially for use in population genetics studies, obtaining confident results for 30 populations, 20 of them admixed. Notably, we confirm a signal of ancient admixture in European populations-including previously undetected admixture in Sardinians and Basques-involving a proportion of 20-40% ancient northern Eurasian ancestry.

  Design:  Retrospective cross-sectional study. 
  Setting:  Tertiary care hospitals in Boston, including Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital. 
  Participants:  We identified 3568 individuals with AA seen in the Partners health care system in Boston between January 1, 2000, and January 1, 2011. We performed comprehensive searches of the Research Patient Data Repository using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code 704.01. We randomly selected 350 patients and manually reviewed their medical records to train and validate a novel artificial intelligence program. This program then used natural language processing to review free-text medical records and confirm a diagnosis of AA. To confirm the algorithm, we manually reviewed a subset of records and found 93.9% validity. 
  Main outcomes and measures:  The prevalence of comorbid conditions was assessed. 
  Results:  Common comorbid conditions included autoimmune diagnoses (thyroid disease in 14.6%, diabetes mellitus in 11.1%, inflammatory bowel disease in (2.0%) [corrected], systemic lupus erythematosus in 4.3%, rheumatoid arthritis in 3.9%, and psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in (6.3%) [corrected], atopy (allergic rhinitis, asthma, and/or eczema in 38.2% and contact dermatitis and other eczema in 35.9%), and mental health problems (depression or anxiety in 25.5%). We also found high prevalences of hyperlipidemia (24.5%), hypertension (21.9%), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (17.3%). This profile was different from that seen in a comparison psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis group. 
  Conclusions and relevance:  We found a high prevalence of comorbid conditions among individuals with AA presenting to academic medical centers in Boston. Physicians caring for patients with AA should consider screening for comorbid conditions.

10.1093/hmg/ddt298  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding the purine metabolic enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). A series of motor, cognitive and neurobehavioral anomalies characterize this disease phenotype, which is still poorly understood. The clinical manifestations of this syndrome are believed to be the consequences of deficiencies in neurodevelopmental pathways that lead to disordered brain function. We have used microRNA array and gene ontology analysis to evaluate the gene expression of differentiating HPRT-deficient human neuron-like cell lines. We set out to identify dysregulated genes implicated in purine-based cellular functions. Our approach was based on the premise that HPRT deficiency affects preeminently the expression and the function of purine-based molecular complexes, such as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and small GTPases. We found that several microRNAs from the miR-17 family cluster and genes encoding GEF are dysregulated in HPRT deficiency. Most notably, our data show that the expression of the exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC) is blunted in HPRT-deficient human neuron-like cell lines and fibroblast cells from LNS patients, and is altered in the cortex, striatum and midbrain of HPRT knockout mouse. We also show a marked impairment in the activation of small GTPase RAP1 in the HPRT-deficient cells, as well as differences in cytoskeleton dynamics that lead to increased motility for HPRT-deficient neuron-like cell lines relative to control. We propose that the alterations in EPAC/RAP1 signaling and cell migration in HPRT deficiency are crucial for neuro-developmental events that may contribute to the neurological dysfunctions in LNS.

10.1530/ERC-13-0357  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a class of small, non-coding RNAs that control gene expression by targeting mRNA and triggering either translational repression or RNA degradation. The objective of our study was to evaluate the involvement of miRNAs in human medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and to identify the markers of metastatic cells and aggressive tumour behaviour. Using matched primary and metastatic tumour samples, we identified a subset of miRNAs aberrantly regulated in metastatic MTC. Deregulated miRNAs were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR and validated by in situ hybridisation on a large independent set of primary and metastatic MTC samples. Our results uncovered ten miRNAs that were significantly expressed and deregulated in metastatic tumours: miR-10a, miR-200b/-200c, miR-7 and miR-29c were down-regulated and miR-130a, miR-138, miR-193a-3p, miR-373 and miR-498 were up-regulated. Bioinformatic approaches revealed potential miRNA targets and signals involved in metastatic MTC pathways. Migration, proliferation and invasion assays were performed in cell lines treated with miR-200 antagomirs to ascertain a direct role for this miRNA in MTC tumourigenesis. We show that the members of miR-200 family regulate the expression of E-cadherin by directly targeting ZEB1 and ZEB2 mRNA and through the enhanced expression of tumour growth factor β (TGFβ)-2 and TGFβ-1. Overall, the treated cells shifted to a mesenchymal phenotype, thereby acquiring an aggressive phenotype with increased motility and invasion. Our data identify a robust miRNA signature associated with metastatic MTC and distinct biological processes, e.g., TGFβ signalling pathway, providing new potential insights into the mechanisms of MTC metastasis.

10.1016/j.brainres.2013.09.046  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Cerebellar granule neuronal cultures have been used to study the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal functions, including neuronal morphogenesis. However, a limitation of this system is the difficulty to analyze isolated neurons because these are required to be maintained at a high density. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to develop a simple and cost-effective method for culturing low-density cerebellar granule neurons. Cerebellar granule cells at two different densities (low- and high-density) were co-cultivated in order for the low-density culture to be supported by the paracrine signals from the high-density culture. This method enabled morphology analysis of isolated cerebellar granule neurons without astrocytic feeder cultures or supplements such as B27. Using this method, we investigated the function of a polarity factor. Studies using hippocampal neurons suggested that glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is an essential regulator of neuronal polarity, and inhibition of GSK-3 results in the formation of multiple axons. Pharmacological inhibitors for GSK-3 (6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime and lithium chloride) did not cause the formation of multiple axons of cerebellar granule neurons but significantly reduced their length. Consistent results were obtained by introducing kinase-dead form of GSK-3 beta (K85A). These results indicated that GSK-3 is not directly involved in the control of neuronal polarity in cerebellar granule neurons. Overall, this study provides a simple method for culturing low-density cerebellar granule neurons and insights in to the neuronal-type dependent function of GSK-3 in neuronal morphogenesis.

10.1534/genetics.112.147330  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Long-range migrations and the resulting admixtures between populations have been important forces shaping human genetic diversity. Most existing methods for detecting and reconstructing historical admixture events are based on allele frequency divergences or patterns of ancestry segments in chromosomes of admixed individuals. An emerging new approach harnesses the exponential decay of admixture-induced linkage disequilibrium (LD) as a function of genetic distance. Here, we comprehensively develop LD-based inference into a versatile tool for investigating admixture. We present a new weighted LD statistic that can be used to infer mixture proportions as well as dates with fewer constraints on reference populations than previous methods. We define an LD-based three-population test for admixture and identify scenarios in which it can detect admixture events that previous formal tests cannot. We further show that we can uncover phylogenetic relationships among populations by comparing weighted LD curves obtained using a suite of references. Finally, we describe several improvements to the computation and fitting of weighted LD curves that greatly increase the robustness and speed of the calculations. We implement all of these advances in a software package, ALDER, which we validate in simulations and apply to test for admixture among all populations from the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP), highlighting insights into the admixture history of Central African Pygmies, Sardinians, and Japanese.

10.2196/jmir.2353  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Medical blogs have emerged as new media, extending to a wider range of medical audiences, including health professionals and patients to share health-related information. However, extraction of quality health-related information from medical blogs is challenging primarily because these blogs lack systematic methods to organize their posts. Medical blogs can be categorized according to their author into (1) physician-written blogs, (2) nurse-written blogs, and (3) patient-written blogs. This study focuses on how to organize physician-written blog posts that discuss disease-related issues and how to extract quality information from these posts. 
  Objective:  The goal of this study was to create and implement a prototype for a Web-based system, called ICDTag, based on a hybrid taxonomy-folksonomy approach that follows a combination of a taxonomy classification schemes and user-generated tags to organize physician-written blog posts and extract information from these posts. 
  Methods:  First, the design specifications for the Web-based system were identified. This system included two modules: (1) a blogging module that was implemented as one or more blogs, and (2) an aggregator module that aggregated posts from different blogs into an aggregator website. We then developed a prototype for this system in which the blogging module included two blogs, the cardiology blog and the gastroenterology blog. To analyze the usage patterns of the prototype, we conducted an experiment with data provided by cardiologists and gastroenterologists. Next, we conducted two evaluation types: (1) an evaluation of the ICDTag blog, in which the browsing functionalities of the blogging module were evaluated from the end-user's perspective using an online questionnaire, and (2) an evaluation of information quality, in which the quality of the content on the aggregator website was assessed from the perspective of medical experts using an emailed questionnaire. 
  Results:  Participants of this experiment included 23 cardiologists and 24 gastroenterologists. Positive evaluations on the main functions and the organization of information on the ICDTag blogs were given by 18 of the participants via an online questionnaire. These results supported our hypothesis that the use of a taxonomy-folksonomy structure has significant potential to improve the organization of information in physician-written blogs. The quality of the content on the aggregator website was assessed by 3 cardiology experts and 3 gastroenterology experts via an email questionnaire. The results of this questionnaire demonstrated that the experts considered the aggregated tags and categories semantically related to the posts' content. 
  Conclusions:  This study demonstrated that applying the hybrid taxonomy-folksonomy approach to physician-written blogs that discuss disease-related issues has valuable potential to make these blogs a more organized and systematic medium and supports the extraction of quality information from their posts. Thus, it is worthwhile to develop more mature systems that make use of the hybrid approach to organize posts in physician-written blogs.

10.1186/1471-2105-14-299  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Comprehensive protein-protein interaction (PPI) maps are a powerful resource for uncovering the molecular basis of genetic interactions and providing mechanistic insights. Over the past decade, high-throughput experimental techniques have been developed to generate PPI maps at proteome scale, first using yeast two-hybrid approaches and more recently via affinity purification combined with mass spectrometry (AP-MS). Unfortunately, data from both protocols are prone to both high false positive and false negative rates. To address these issues, many methods have been developed to post-process raw PPI data. However, with few exceptions, these methods only analyze binary experimental data (in which each potential interaction tested is deemed either observed or unobserved), neglecting quantitative information available from AP-MS such as spectral counts. 
  Results:  We propose a novel method for incorporating quantitative information from AP-MS data into existing PPI inference methods that analyze binary interaction data. Our approach introduces a probabilistic framework that models the statistical noise inherent in observations of co-purifications. Using a sampling-based approach, we model the uncertainty of interactions with low spectral counts by generating an ensemble of possible alternative experimental outcomes. We then apply the existing method of choice to each alternative outcome and aggregate results over the ensemble. We validate our approach on three recent AP-MS data sets and demonstrate performance comparable to or better than state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we provide an in-depth discussion comparing the theoretical bases of existing approaches and identify common aspects that may be key to their performance. 
  Conclusions:  Our sampling framework extends the existing body of work on PPI analysis using binary interaction data to apply to the richer quantitative data now commonly available through AP-MS assays. This framework is quite general, and many enhancements are likely possible. Fruitful future directions may include investigating more sophisticated schemes for converting spectral counts to probabilities and applying the framework to direct protein complex prediction methods.

10.1016/j.jecp.2013.03.009  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Dyslexic and non-dyslexic readers engaged in a short training aimed at learning eight basic letter-speech sound correspondences within an artificial orthography. We examined whether a letter-speech sound binding deficit is behaviorally detectable within the initial steps of learning a novel script. Both letter knowledge and word reading ability within the artificial script were assessed. An additional goal was to investigate the influence of instructional approach on the initial learning of letter-speech sound correspondences. We assigned children from both groups to one of three different training conditions: (a) explicit instruction, (b) implicit associative learning within a computer game environment, or (c) a combination of (a) and (b) in which explicit instruction is followed by implicit learning. Our results indicated that dyslexics were outperformed by the controls on a time-pressured binding task and a word reading task within the artificial orthography, providing empirical support for the view that a letter-speech sound binding deficit is a key factor in dyslexia. A combination of explicit instruction and implicit techniques proved to be a more powerful tool in the initial teaching of letter-sound correspondences than implicit training alone.

10.1155/2013/345968  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Carotid atherosclerosis is a major reason of stroke, a leading cause of death and disability. In this paper, a segmentation method based on Active Shape Model (ASM) is developed and evaluated to outline common carotid artery (CCA) for carotid atherosclerosis computer-aided evaluation and diagnosis. The proposed method is used to segment both media-adventitia-boundary (MAB) and lumen-intima-boundary (LIB) on transverse views slices from three-dimensional ultrasound (3D US) images. The data set consists of sixty-eight, 17 × 2 × 2, 3D US volume data acquired from the left and right carotid arteries of seventeen patients (eight treated with 80 mg atorvastatin and nine with placebo), who had carotid stenosis of 60% or more, at baseline and after three months of treatment. Manually outlined boundaries by expert are adopted as the ground truth for evaluation. For the MAB and LIB segmentations, respectively, the algorithm yielded Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 94.4% ± 3.2% and 92.8% ± 3.3%, mean absolute distances (MAD) of 0.26 ± 0.18 mm and 0.33 ± 0.21 mm, and maximum absolute distances (MAXD) of 0.75 ± 0.46 mm and 0.84 ± 0.39 mm. It took 4.3 ± 0.5 mins to segment single 3D US images, while it took 11.7 ± 1.2 mins for manual segmentation. The method would promote the translation of carotid 3D US to clinical care for the monitoring of the atherosclerotic disease progression and regression.

10.1007/s00464-012-2633-5  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Increased intraocular pressure (IOP) during surgery can result in serious ophthalmic complications. We hypothesized that carbon dioxide (CO₂) insufflation of the neck during endoscopic thyroidectomy would constrict the jugular veins mechanically, causing elevated venous pressure and thus elevated IOP. We compared IOP changes at each step of open thyroidectomy (OT) versus robot-assisted endoscopic thyroidectomy (RET) METHODS: Perioperatively, IOP was measured at six time points in patients undergoing OT (n = 18) or RET with CO₂ insufflation (n = 19). Anesthesia, ventilatory strategy, intravenous infusions, and surgical positioning were standardized 
  Results:  In both groups, induction of anesthesia reduced IOP, but surgical positioning with the neck in extension had no effect on IOP. In the OT group, IOP remained unchanged during anesthesia. In the RET group, CO₂ insufflation significantly increased IOP to an average of 3.6 ± 3.0 mmHg higher than the previous measurement (P &lt; 0.001), and this IOP increase persisted immediately before gas deflation. These elevated IOP values during CO₂ insufflation in the RET group were significantly higher than those at corresponding time points in the OT group. However, these elevated IOP values were similar to the pre-anesthetic baseline IOP CONCLUSION: CO₂ insufflation of the neck at pressure of 6 mmHg increased the IOP significantly compared with open thyroidectomy. However, this increase in IOP could be balanced by an anesthetic-induced IOP-lowering effect, thereby having no clinical significance in patients with normal IOP undergoing robot-assisted endoscopic thyroidectomy.

10.1007/s11248-012-9667-2  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) controls growth and differentiation in different cell types, including cardiac cells. However, its downstream effectors are poorly understood. To investigate the transcriptional targets of HGF, we analyzed the hearts of neonatal mice with cardiomyocyte-specific HGF overexpression with whole genome DNA microarrays. When comparing HGF expressing versus control hearts, we found a total of 249 transcripts with significant gene expression changes (210 upregulated and 39 downregulated). Gene Ontology (GO) annotation analysis revealed that the transcripts modulated by HGF were enriched for metabolic functions including: protein translation, vesicle-mediated transport, regulation of transcription, regulation of muscle development. Using an automated literature meta-analysis approach, we obtained a co-occurrence network oriented to the positive regulatory role of Myc and Notch1 in controlling some of the genes which are downstream to HGF. GO analysis of this network returned genes involved in the regulation of heart development. HGF positively controls MyocD, an activator of cardiac gene expression, and Hdac5, an inhibitor of cardiac growth. These results may unveil a new role of HGF in the modulation of signaling pathways implicated in the activation or repression of cardiomyogenesis.

10.1111/j.1464-410X.2012.11122.x  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   WHAT'S KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT? AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Postoperative complications for open radical nephrectomy (ORN), laparoscopic radical nephrectomy (LRN), and open partial nephrectomy (OPN) and its relationship with hospitalisation costs and mortality remain poorly described. The present population-based study suggests modest differences in postoperative complications estimated at 27%, 23%, and 24% among patients with kidney cancer undergoing ORN, LRN, and OPN, respectively. Moreover, postoperative complications were associated with higher mortality, length of stay and total costs of hospitalisation. 
  Objectives:  The association of complications after renal surgery for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with in-hospital mortality and costs remains to be defined. To describe the incidence of complications after open radical nephrectomy (ORN), laparoscopic RN (LRN), and open partial nephrectomy (OPN); and to evaluate its relationship with in-hospital mortality and total costs. 
  Patients and methods:  We identified 49 983 individuals who underwent ORN (35 712), LRN (5327), or OPN (8944) for RCC at 2037 hospitals from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2001-2008. The outcomes assessed were in-hospital mortality and total hospitalisation costs. Multivariable logistic regression and generalised estimating equations were used to test the associations between complications and in-hospital mortality and total costs. 
  Results:  With 26.0% of patients experiencing postoperative complications, there were modest differences in the proportion of patients with complications after ORN, LRN, and OPN at 27.0%, 22.6%, and 24.0%, respectively (P &lt; 0.001). After adjusting for patient and hospital variables, postoperative complications resulted in higher odds of in-hospital death for ORN (odds ratio [OR] 7.20; P &lt; 0.001), LRN (OR 12.04; P &lt; 0.001), and OPN (OR 7.82; P &lt; 0.001). Adjusted total costs also rose significantly with the presence of any postoperative complications compared with those without any complications for ORN ($21 242 vs $13 183; P &lt; 0.001), LRN ($19 548 vs $12 555; P &lt; 0.001), and OPN ($18 883 vs $12 098; P &lt; 0.001). 
  Conclusions:  With about a quarter of patients experiencing postoperative complications, adverse events for ORN, LRN, and OPN carry a significant risk of in-hospital death and higher total costs. Efforts to reduce postoperative complications may correlate with substantial reductions in hospital mortality and total costs.

10.1016/j.eururo.2013.01.006  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Long-term oncologic and functional outcomes after robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) for bladder cancer (BCa) are lacking. 
  Objective:  To report oncologic and functional outcomes in a cohort of patients who have completed a minimum of 5 yr and a maximum of 8 yr of follow-up after RARC and extracorporeal urinary diversion. 
  Design, setting, and participants:  In this paper, we report on the experience from one of the first European urology centres to introduce RARC. Only patients between 2004 and 2006 were included to ensure follow-up of ≥ 5 yr. We report on an analysis of oncologic outcomes in 14 patients (11 males and 3 females) with muscle-invasive/high-grade non-muscle-invasive or bacillus Calmette-Guérin-refractory carcinoma in situ who opted to have RARC. 
  Intervention:  RARC with pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed using the three-arm standard da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, CA, USA). Urinary diversion, either ileal conduit (n=12) or orthotopic neobladder (n=2), was constructed extracorporeally. 
  Outcome measurements:  Parameters were recorded in a prospectively maintained database including assessment of renal function, overall survival, disease-specific survival, development of metastases, and functional outcomes. 
  Statistical analysis:  Results were analysed using descriptive statistical analysis. Survival data were analysed and presented using the Kaplan-Meier survival curve. 
  Results and limitations:  Five of the 14 patients have died. Three patients died of metastatic disease, and two died of unrelated causes. Two other patients are alive with metastases, and another has developed primary lung cancer. Six patients are alive and disease-free. These results show overall survival of 64%, disease-specific survival of 75%, and disease-free survival of 50%. None of the patients had deterioration of renal function necessitating renal replacement therapy. Three of four previously potent patients having nerve-sparing RARC recovered erectile function. The study is limited by the relatively small number of highly selected patients undergoing RARC, which was a novel technique 8 yr ago. The standard da Vinci Surgical System made extended lymphadenectomy difficult. 
  Conclusions:  Within limitations, in our experience RARC achieved excellent control of local disease, but the outcomes in patients with metastatic disease seem to be equivalent to the outcomes of open radical cystectomy.

10.1177/0218492312466861  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Lobectomy remains the gold standard with regard to potentially curative resection of non-small-cell lung carcinoma. We aimed to investigate whether there is a survival difference in stage 1 non-small-cell lung cancer patients who undergo lobectomy compared to a wedge resection. 
  Methods:  We retrospectively analyzed a prospective database of 1283 patients who had potentially curative resection for stage 1 non-small-cell lung cancer. Only patients with adenocarcinoma, squamous or adenosquamous carcinoma were included. We benchmarked our 5-year survival against the 6th International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer results. Three techniques were used to assess the effect of a lobectomy compared to a wedge resection with regard to long-term survival: Cox multivariate regression analysis, neuronal network analysis, and propensity matching. 
  Results:  Benchmarking failed to reveal any significant difference compared to the 6th International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer results. Crude analysis demonstrated superiority of lobectomy compared to wedge resection, p = 0.02. Cox regression analysis confirmed that age, body mass index, female sex, being a current smoker, tumor diameter, and preoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 s were all significant factors determining long-term survival. Wedge resection was not a significant factor. Neuronal network analysis concurred with the Cox regression analysis. Propensity matching with 1:1 matching demonstrated that wedge resections was not inferior to a lobectomy, p = 0.10. 
  Conclusions:  Cox regression analysis, neuronal network analysis, and propensity matching in stage 1 non-small-cell lung cancer demonstrate no difference in long-term survival after wedge resection compared to lobectomy.

10.1016/j.cognition.2013.01.005  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Five experiments provide evidence for a class of 'dual character concepts.' Dual character concepts characterize their members in terms of both (a) a set of concrete features and (b) the abstract values that these features serve to realize. As such, these concepts provide two bases for evaluating category members and two different criteria for category membership. Experiment 1 provides support for the notion that dual character concepts have two bases for evaluation. Experiments 2-4 explore the claim that dual character concepts have two different criteria for category membership. The results show that when an object possesses the appropriate concrete features, but does not fulfill the appropriate abstract value, it is judged to be a category member in one sense but not in another. Finally, Experiment 5 uses the theory developed here to construct artificial dual character concepts and examines whether participants react to these artificial concepts in the same way as naturally occurring dual character concepts. The present studies serve to define the nature of dual character concepts and distinguish them from other types of concepts (e.g., natural kind concepts), which share some, but not all of the properties of dual character concepts. More broadly, these phenomena suggest a normative dimension in everyday conceptual representation.

10.3892/or.2013.2602  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Tumor size indicates the extent of cell proliferation in most cases of colorectal cancer (CRC), although there are some advanced small tumors with metastases. Lymph node metastasis is a significant factor that greatly impacts disease prognosis in CRC cases. The underlying factors that cause lymph node metastasis in CRC cells are not fully understood. We investigated the mechanism that might induce CRC metastasis by focusing on smaller sized (&lt;2 cm) invasive tumors. We carried out gene expression array analysis for CRC cases; group 1 consisted of 6 cases with tumors &lt;2 cm with metastases, and group 2 consisted of 65 cases with tumors &gt;2 cm without metastases. Results were validated using gene expression array data from an additional 77 cases and another bulk case set of 172 cases. Gene ontology and pathway analysis using microarray data revealed that anti-apoptotic activity had a crucial role in CRC metastasis. High mobility group A1 (HMGA1) was identified as a biomarker for poor prognosis and metastasis formation. HMGA1 expression levels were higher in lymph node-positive cases than in lymph node-negative cases, even in subgroup analysis of submucosal invasive cases. The present study strongly supports the clinical significance of HMGA1 expression as a predictive indicator of lymph node metastasis in CRC cases, even in submucosal invasive cases which could be cured by local resection.

10.1371/journal.pone.0070622  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Interleukin-1β and Tumor Necrosis Factor α play related, but distinct, roles in immunity and disease. Our study revealed major mechanistic distinctions in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling-dependent induction for the rapidly expressed genes (IL1B and TNF) coding for these two cytokines. Prior to induction, TNF exhibited pre-bound TATA Binding Protein (TBP) and paused RNA Polymerase II (Pol II), hallmarks of poised immediate-early (IE) genes. In contrast, unstimulated IL1B displayed very low levels of both TBP and paused Pol II, requiring the lineage-specific Spi-1/PU.1 (Spi1) transcription factor as an anchor for induction-dependent interaction with two TLR-activated transcription factors, C/EBPβ and NF-κB. Activation and DNA binding of these two pre-expressed factors resulted in de novo recruitment of TBP and Pol II to IL1B in concert with a permissive state for elongation mediated by the recruitment of elongation factor P-TEFb. This Spi1-dependent mechanism for IL1B transcription, which is unique for a rapidly-induced/poised IE gene, was more dependent upon P-TEFb than was the case for the TNF gene. Furthermore, the dependence on phosphoinositide 3-kinase for P-TEFb recruitment to IL1B paralleled a greater sensitivity to the metabolic state of the cell and a lower sensitivity to the phenomenon of endotoxin tolerance than was evident for TNF. Such differences in induction mechanisms argue against the prevailing paradigm that all IE genes possess paused Pol II and may further delineate the specific roles played by each of these rapidly expressed immune modulators.

10.1186/1471-2229-13-170  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  HIGH-LEVEL EXPRESSION OF SUGAR INDUCIBLE GENE2 (HSI2), also known as VAL1, is a B3 domain transcriptional repressor that acts redundantly with its closest relative, HSI2-LIKE1 (HSL1), to suppress the seed maturation program following germination. Mutant hsi2 hsl1 seedlings are arrested early in development and differentially express a number of abiotic stress-related genes. To test the potential requirement for HSI2 during abiotic stress, hsi2 single mutants and plants overexpressing HSI2 were subjected to simulated drought stress by withholding watering, and characterized through physiological, metabolic and gene expression studies. 
  Results:  The hsi2 mutants demonstrated reduced wilting and maintained higher relative water content than wild-type after withholding watering, while the overexpressing lines displayed the opposite phenotype. The hsi2 mutant displayed lower constitutive and ABA-induced stomatal conductance than wild-type and accumulated lower levels of ABA metabolites and several osmolytes and osmoprotectants following water withdrawal. Microarray comparisons between wild-type and the hsi2 mutant revealed that steady-state levels of numerous stress-induced genes were up-regulated in the mutant in the absence of stress but down-regulated at visible wilting. Plants with altered levels of HSI2 responded to exogenous application of ABA and a long-lived ABA analog, but the hsi2 mutant did not show altered expression of several ABA-responsive or ABA signalling genes 4 hr after application. 
  Conclusions:  These results implicate HSI2 as a negative regulator of drought stress response in Arabidopsis, acting, at least in part, by regulating transpirational water loss. Metabolic and global transcript profiling comparisons of the hsi2 mutant and wild-type plants do not support a model whereby the greater drought tolerance observed in the hsi2 mutant is conferred by the accumulation of known osmolytes and osmoprotectants. Instead, data are consistent with mutants experiencing a relatively milder dehydration stress following water withdrawal.

10.1186/1471-2105-14-S8-S8  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Recent microbiologic studies have shown that quorum sensing mechanisms, which serve as one of the fundamental requirements for bacterial survival, exist widely in bacterial intra- and inter-species cell-cell communication. Many simulation models, inspired by the social behavior of natural organisms, are presented to provide new approaches for solving realistic optimization problems. Most of these simulation models follow population-based modelling approaches, where all the individuals are updated according to the same rules. Therefore, it is difficult to maintain the diversity of the population. 
  Results:  In this paper, we present a computational model termed LCM-QS, which simulates the bacterial quorum-sensing (QS) mechanism using an individual-based modelling approach under the framework of Agent-Environment-Rule (AER) scheme, i.e. bacterial lifecycle model (LCM). LCM-QS model can be classified into three main sub-models: chemotaxis with QS sub-model, reproduction and elimination sub-model and migration sub-model. The proposed model is used to not only imitate the bacterial evolution process at the single-cell level, but also concentrate on the study of bacterial macroscopic behaviour. Comparative experiments under four different scenarios have been conducted in an artificial 3-D environment with nutrients and noxious distribution. Detailed study on bacterial chemotatic processes with quorum sensing and without quorum sensing are compared. By using quorum sensing mechanisms, artificial bacteria working together can find the nutrient concentration (or global optimum) quickly in the artificial environment. 
  Conclusions:  Biomimicry of quorum sensing mechanisms using the lifecycle model allows the artificial bacteria endowed with the communication abilities, which are essential to obtain more valuable information to guide their search cooperatively towards the preferred nutrient concentrations. It can also provide an inspiration for designing new swarm intelligence optimization algorithms, which can be used for solving the real-world problems.

10.1159/000354607  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  Vitiligo is a common disorder of depigmentation that has been associated with other autoimmune diseases. No recent large-scale data exist on the rates of comorbidities associated with vitiligo from the United States population. 
  Objectives:  To identify the prevalence of comorbidities as well as associated laboratory abnormalities in vitiligo patients. 
  Methods:  All medical records dating from January 1, 2000 to June 21, 2011 within the Research Patient Data Repository were evaluated retrospectively using a novel artificial intelligence-based computer program. A total of 3,280 patients carrying the diagnosis of vitiligo were identified using ICD-9 code 709.01. We randomly selected 300 patients and validated the diagnosis by manually reviewing their medical records. These results were used to create a model that was then applied to the larger set yielding 2,441 true vitiligo patients. 1,657 (68%) were diagnosed by dermatologists and 784 (32%) by non-dermatologists. We identified the prevalence of other comorbid autoimmune conditions by searching problem lists of vitiligo patients and collected laboratory data from the first available data point in the system for each patient. 
  Results:  Women were more frequently represented (57.6%) than men (42.4%). The majority of vitiligo patients were White/Caucasian (56.9%), followed by Hispanic/Latino (19.4%). 565 (23%) had one of the following comorbidities: 287 thyroid-related, 186 psoriasis, 72 rheumatoid arthritis, 59 alopecia areata, 55 inflammatory bowel disease, 53 systemic lupus and 20 type I diabetes mellitus. 41% had elevated anti-nuclear antibody levels. Almost half of the patients tested had elevated thyroid peroxidase antibodies. Over 50% of the patients tested had low or insufficient levels of 25-OH vitamin D. 
  Conclusion:  We found a high prevalence of comorbidities among individuals with vitiligo presenting to teaching hospitals in Boston, Mass. Comorbid autoimmune conditions were seen in 23% of vitiligo patients, thyroid disorders and psoriasis being the most common. Screening for these conditions, especially thyroid disorders, should be considered in vitiligo patients.

10.1093/nar/gkt1203  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   PortEco (http://porteco.org) aims to collect, curate and provide data and analysis tools to support basic biological research in Escherichia coli (and eventually other bacterial systems). PortEco is implemented as a 'virtual' model organism database that provides a single unified interface to the user, while integrating information from a variety of sources. The main focus of PortEco is to enable broad use of the growing number of high-throughput experiments available for E. coli, and to leverage community annotation through the EcoliWiki and GONUTS systems. Currently, PortEco includes curated data from hundreds of genome-wide RNA expression studies, from high-throughput phenotyping of single-gene knockouts under hundreds of annotated conditions, from chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments for tens of different DNA-binding factors and from ribosome profiling experiments that yield insights into protein expression. Conditions have been annotated with a consistent vocabulary, and data have been consistently normalized to enable users to find, compare and interpret relevant experiments. PortEco includes tools for data analysis, including clustering, enrichment analysis and exploration via genome browsers. PortEco search and data analysis tools are extensively linked to the curated gene, metabolic pathway and regulation content at its sister site, EcoCyc.

10.1016/j.jcrs.2013.04.038  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Purpose:  To assess the visual and refractive outcomes of femtosecond laser-assisted implantation of Ferrara-type intrastromal corneal ring segments (ICRS) in post-penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) eyes. 
  Setting:  Instituto Oftalmológico Fernández-Vega, Oviedo, Spain. 
  Design:  Cohort study. 
  Methods:  Patients with previous PKP had ICRS implantation after femtosecond laser tunnel creation. The uncorrected (UDVA) and corrected (CDVA) distance visual acuities and residual refractive errors were recorded before and 6 months after ICRS implantation. The power vector method was used to analyze refractive errors preoperatively and postoperatively. 
  Results:  This study enrolled 32 eyes of 30 patients. The mean UDVA (Snellen decimal) changed from 0.16 ± 0.15 (SD) preoperatively to 0.43 ± 0.28 postoperatively (P&lt;.0001). Postoperatively, the UDVA was 20/40 or better in 40.6% of eyes. The mean CDVA was 0.67 ± 0.22 preoperatively and 0.80 ± 0.19 postoperatively (P&lt;.0001). Postoperatively, the CDVA was better than 20/40 in 96.9% of eyes and 20/25 or better in 56.2% of eyes. By 6 months postoperatively, no eye had lost more than 2 lines of CDVA, 4 eyes lost 1 line, 6 eyes had no change, 9 eyes gained 1 line, and 13 eyes gained 2 or more lines. The safety index at 6 months was 1.20. The spherical equivalent and astigmatism components were significantly reduced after ICRS implantation (P&lt;.04). 
  Conclusion:  Intrastromal corneal ring segment implantation using the femtosecond laser may be a good alternative for high astigmatism correction in post-PKP eyes.

10.1016/j.artmed.2013.09.001  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Background:  A highly sensitive real-time syndrome surveillance system is critical to detect, monitor, and control infectious disease outbreaks, such as influenza. Direct comparisons of diagnostic accuracy of various surveillance systems are scarce. 
  Objective:  To statistically compare sensitivity and specificity of multiple proprietary and open source syndrome surveillance systems to detect influenza-like illness (ILI). 
  Methods:  A retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted utilizing data from 1122 patients seen during November 1–7, 2009 in the emergency department of a single urban academic medical center. The study compared the Geographic Utilization of Artificial Intelligence in Real-time for Disease Identification and Alert Notification (GUARDIAN) system to the Complaint Coder (CoCo) of the Real-time Outbreak Detection System (RODS), the Symptom Coder (SyCo) of RODS, and to a standardized report generated via a proprietary electronic medical record (EMR) system. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of each classifier's ability to identify ILI cases were calculated and compared to a manual review by a board-certified emergency physician. Chi-square and McNemar's tests were used to evaluate the statistical difference between the various surveillance systems.ResultsThe performance of GUARDIAN in detecting ILI in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, as compared to a physician chart review, was 95.5%, 97.6%, and 97.1%, respectively. The EMR-generated reports were the next best system at identifying disease activity with a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 36.7%, 99.3%, and 83.2%, respectively. RODS (CoCo and SyCo) had similar sensitivity (35.3%) but slightly different specificity (CoCo = 98.9%; SyCo = 99.3%). The GUARDIAN surveillance system with its multiple data sources performed significantly better compared to CoCo (χ2 = 130.6, p &lt; 0.05), SyCo (χ2 = 125.2, p &lt; 0.05), and EMR-based reports (χ2 = 121.3, p &lt; 0.05). In addition, similar significant improvements in the accuracy (&gt;12%) and sensitivity (&gt;47%) were observed for GUARDIAN with only chief complaint data as compared to RODS (CoCo and SyCo) and EMR-based reports. 
  Conclusion:  In our study population, the GUARDIAN surveillance system, with its ability to utilize multiple data sources from patient encounters and real-time automaticity, demonstrated a more robust performance when compared to standard EMR-based reports and the RODS systems in detecting ILI. More large-scale studies are needed to validate the study findings, and to compare the performance of GUARDIAN in detecting other infectious diseases.

10.1038/leu.2013.365  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) is a B-cell neoplasm whose molecular pathogenesis remains fundamentally unexplained, requiring more precise diagnostic markers. Previous molecular studies have revealed 7q loss and mutations of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), B-cell receptor (BCR) and Notch signalling genes. We performed whole-exome sequencing in a series of SMZL cases. Results confirmed that SMZL is an entity distinct from other low-grade B-cell lymphomas, and identified mutations in multiple genes involved in marginal zone development, and others involved in NF-κB, BCR, chromatin remodelling and the cytoskeleton.

10.1016/j.amjoto.2013.07.004  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Purpose and background:  Acoustic signals are transmitted through the external and middle ear mechanically to the cochlea where they are transduced into electrical impulse for further transmission via the auditory nerve. The auditory nerve encodes the acoustic sounds that are conveyed to the auditory brainstem. Multiple brainstem nuclei, the cochlea, the midbrain, the thalamus, and the cortex constitute the central auditory system. In clinical practice, auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to simple stimuli such as click or tones are widely used. Recently, complex stimuli or complex auditory brain responses (cABRs), such as monosyllabic speech stimuli and music, are being used as a tool to study the brainstem processing of speech sounds. We have used the classic 'click' as well as, for the first time, the artificial successive complex stimuli 'ba', which constitutes the Greek word 'baba' corresponding to the English 'daddy'. 
  Patients and methods:  Twenty young adults institutionally diagnosed as dyslexic (10 subjects) or light dyslexic (10 subjects) comprised the diseased group. Twenty sex-, age-, education-, hearing sensitivity-, and IQ-matched normal subjects comprised the control group. Measurements included the absolute latencies of waves I through V, the interpeak latencies elicited by the classical acoustic click, the negative peak latencies of A and C waves, as well as the interpeak latencies of A-C elicited by the verbal stimulus 'baba' created on a digital speech synthesizer. 
  Results:  The absolute peak latencies of waves I, III, and V in response to monoaural rarefaction clicks as well as the interpeak latencies I-III, III-V, and I-V in the dyslexic subjects, although increased in comparison with normal subjects, did not reach the level of a significant difference (p&lt;0.05). However, the absolute peak latencies of the negative wave C and the interpeak latencies of A-C elicited by verbal stimuli were found to be increased in the dyslexic group in comparison with the control group (p=0.0004 and p=0.045, respectively). In the subgroup consisting of 10 patients suffering from 'other learning disabilities' and who were characterized as with 'light' dyslexia according to dyslexia tests, no significant delays were found in peak latencies A and C and interpeak latencies A-C in comparison with the control group. 
  Conclusions:  Acoustic representation of a speech sound and, in particular, the disyllabic word 'baba' was found to be abnormal, as low as the auditory brainstem. Because ABRs mature in early life, this can help to identify subjects with acoustically based learning problems and apply early intervention, rehabilitation, and treatment. Further studies and more experience with more patients and pathological conditions such as plasticity of the auditory system, cochlear implants, hearing aids, presbycusis, or acoustic neuropathy are necessary until this type of testing is ready for clinical application.

10.1016/j.forsciint.2013.11.016  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Chemical analysis of latent fingermarks, "touch chemistry," has the potential of providing intelligence or forensically relevant information. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI/TOF MS) was used as an analytical platform for obtaining mass spectra and chemical images of target drugs and explosives in fingermark residues following conventional fingerprint development methods and MALDI matrix processing. There were two main purposes of this research: (1) develop effective laboratory methods for detecting drugs and explosives in fingermark residues and (2) determine the feasibility of detecting drugs and explosives after casual contact with pills, powders, and residues. Further, synthetic latent print reference pads were evaluated as mimics of natural fingermark residue to determine if the pads could be used for method development and quality control. The results suggest that artificial amino acid and sebaceous oil residue pads are not suitable to adequately simulate natural fingermark chemistry for MALDI/TOF MS analysis. However, the pads were useful for designing experiments and setting instrumental parameters. Based on the natural fingermark residue experiments, handling whole or broken pills did not transfer sufficient quantities of drugs to allow for definitive detection. Transferring drugs or explosives in the form of powders and residues was successful for preparing analytes for detection after contact with fingers and deposition of fingermark residue. One downfall to handling powders was that the analyte particles were easily spread beyond the original fingermark during development. Analyte particles were confined in the original fingermark when using transfer residues. The MALDI/TOF MS was able to detect procaine, pseudoephedrine, TNT, and RDX from contact residue under laboratory conditions with the integration of conventional fingerprint development methods and MALDI matrix. MALDI/TOF MS is a nondestructive technique which provides chemical information in both the mass spectra and chemical images.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.12.021  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Exploratory (i.e., voxelwise) spatial methods are commonly used in neuroimaging to identify areas that show an effect when a region-of-interest (ROI) analysis cannot be performed because no strong a priori anatomical hypothesis exists. However, noise at a single voxel is much higher than noise in a ROI making noise management critical to successful exploratory analysis. This work explores how preprocessing choices affect the bias and variability of voxelwise kinetic modeling analysis of brain positron emission tomography (PET) data. These choices include the use of volume- or cortical surface-based smoothing, level of smoothing, use of voxelwise partial volume correction (PVC), and PVC masking threshold. PVC was implemented using the Muller-Gartner method with the masking out of voxels with low gray matter (GM) partial volume fraction. Dynamic PET scans of an antagonist serotonin-4 receptor radioligand ([(11)C]SB207145) were collected on sixteen healthy subjects using a Siemens HRRT PET scanner. Kinetic modeling was used to compute maps of non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) after preprocessing. The results showed a complicated interaction between smoothing, PVC, and masking on BPND estimates. Volume-based smoothing resulted in large bias and intersubject variance because it smears signal across tissue types. In some cases, PVC with volume smoothing paradoxically caused the estimated BPND to be less than when no PVC was used at all. When applied in the absence of PVC, cortical surface-based smoothing resulted in dramatically less bias and the least variance of the methods tested for smoothing levels 5mm and higher. When used in combination with PVC, surface-based smoothing minimized the bias without significantly increasing the variance. Surface-based smoothing resulted in 2-4 times less intersubject variance than when volume smoothing was used. This translates into more than 4 times fewer subjects needed in a group analysis to achieve similarly powered statistical tests. Surface-based smoothing has less bias and variance because it respects cortical geometry by smoothing the PET data only along the cortical ribbon and so does not contaminate the GM signal with that of white matter and cerebrospinal fluid. The use of surface-based analysis in PET should result in substantial improvements in the reliability and detectability of effects in exploratory PET analysis, with or without PVC.

10.1016/j.artmed.2012.12.005  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Objective:  Our aim is to use multi-dimensional Bayesian network classifiers in order to predict the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors given an input set of respective resistance mutations that an HIV patient carries. 
  Materials and methods:  Multi-dimensional Bayesian network classifiers (MBCs) are probabilistic graphical models especially designed to solve multi-dimensional classification problems, where each input instance in the data set has to be assigned simultaneously to multiple output class variables that are not necessarily binary. In this paper, we introduce a new method, named MB-MBC, for learning MBCs from data by determining the Markov blanket around each class variable using the HITON algorithm. Our method is applied to both reverse transcriptase and protease data sets obtained from the Stanford HIV-1 database. 
  Results:  Regarding the prediction of antiretroviral combination therapies, the experimental study shows promising results in terms of classification accuracy compared with state-of-the-art MBC learning algorithms. For reverse transcriptase inhibitors, we get 71% and 11% in mean and global accuracy, respectively; while for protease inhibitors, we get more than 84% and 31% in mean and global accuracy, respectively. In addition, the analysis of MBC graphical structures lets us gain insight into both known and novel interactions between reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors and their respective resistance mutations. 
  Conclusion:  MB-MBC algorithm is a valuable tool to analyze the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors prediction problem and to discover interactions within and between these two classes of inhibitors.

10.1016/j.clinph.2012.12.003  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Objective:  This study aimed to determine effects of chronic methamphetamine (MA) abuse on global organization of the functional brain connectivity. 
  Methods:  Eyes-closed resting-state EEGs of 36 MA abusers and 36 age-matched healthy subjects were recorded using a 32-channel system. The EEGs (1-60 Hz), after removing artifacts, were decomposed into the conventional EEG bands. Using visibility graph similarity (VGS) and coherence methods, the VGS and coherence matrices in each EEG band were constructed. Then the Small-World Network properties, clustering coefficient (C), mean path length (L) and C/L, of the VGS and coherence matrices, were computed in all EEG bands. Then using the Mann-Whitney test and an artificial neural network the differences of C, L and C/L between the two groups were evaluated. 
  Results:  The MA abusers showed higher C, lower L and higher C/L at the gamma band (p-value &lt; 0.005). An accuracy of 82.8% in discriminating the two groups was obtained by the classifier. 
  Conclusions:  The topology of the functional brain connectivity is disrupted in MA abusers, as depicted by deviation from Small-Worldness in the gamma band. 
  Significance:  This is the first but quasi-experimental study showing disrupted topology of the functional brain networks in MA abusers.

10.1016/j.midw.2013.07.001  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Objectives:  during 2007 the Chilean Ministry of Public Health introduced the Model of Integrated and Humanized Health Services, in addition to the Clinical Guide for Humanized Care during Delivery. Three years after its implementation, a study was conducted (i) to describe selected clinical outcomes of women who received care within this model, (ii) to identify the degree of maternal-newborn well-being and (iii) to explore the perception of this humanised attention during labour and delivery by both the professional staff (obstetricians and midwives) and consumers. 
  Design and method:  a cross-sectional, descriptive study using both quantitative and qualitative methods was conducted with 508 women who delivered in two major hospitals within the National Health System in the metropolitan area of Santiago, Chile, from September 2010 until June 2011. The quantitative methods included a validated survey of maternal well-being and an adapted version of the American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM) standardised antepartum and intrapartum data set. The qualitative methods included six focus groups discussions (FGDs), with midwives, obstetricians and consumers. Additionally, two in depth interviews were carried out with the directors of the maternity units. 
  Findings:  the quantitative findings showed poor implementation of the guidelines: 92.7% of the women had medically induced labours (artificial rupture of the membranes and received oxytocin and epidural anaesthesia), and almost one-third of the women reported discontent with the care they received. The qualitative findings showed that the main complaint perceived by the midwives was that the health system was highly hierarchical and medicalised and that the obstetricians were not engaged in this modality of assistance. The women (consumers) highlighted that professionals (midwives and obstetricians) were highly technically skilled, and they felt confident in their assistance. However, women complained about receiving inadequate personal treatment from these professionals. The obstetricians showed no self-critique, stating that they always expressed concern for their patients and that they provided humanised professional assistance. 
  Conclusions and implications for practice:  by illuminating the main strengths and weakness with regard to the application of the model, these findings can help to inform strategies and actions to improve its implementation.

PMID:24001466  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |    Introduction:  Denmark has been engaged in the Afghanistan war and as a result, Rigshospitalet has received a number of multi-traumatized Danish soldiers. Lesions sustained in armed conflict differ from their civilian counterparts and knowledge of the pathophysiology related to these types of lesions is essential when engaging in the intensive care of these patients. 
  Material and methods:  The study was conducted as a retrospective survey of Danish soldiers evacuated from Afghanistan to the Intensive Care Unit at Rigshospitalet in the 2002-2012 period. The following data were recorded: age, gender, hospitalization (days), mortality, organ involvement, respiratory therapy, dialysis, circulatory supportive care, antibiotic treatment and bacteriology. Furthermore, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation, Simplified Acute Physiology Score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were calculated. 
  Results:  A total of twenty patients were identified and included in the study. All patients had sustained serious blast injuries as a result of explosion. Primarily the central nervous system, respiratory, musculoskeletal and abdominal systems were affected by the explosions. Eighteen patients survived to discharge and two patients died. 
  Discussion:  Explosion was the most frequent cause of injury in all cases and caused damage to several organ systems. Infections after combat injuries are a major problem because of the different microbiological profile. 
  Conclusion:  The use of explosives has been and remains a substantial part of warfare, and this review has showed us that the knowledge of the mechanism of injury is indeed essential, and that intelligence on the microbiological flora of the geographical location of the conflict is essential.

10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.11.027  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) has become a popular imaging modality for probing the microstructural properties of white matter and comparing them between populations in vivo. However, the contrast in DW-MRI arises from the microscopic random motion of water molecules in brain tissues, which makes it particularly sensitive to macroscopic head motion. Although this has been known since the introduction of DW-MRI, most studies that use this modality for group comparisons do not report measures of head motion for each group and rely on registration-based correction methods that cannot eliminate the full effects of head motion on the DW-MRI contrast. In this work we use data from children with autism and typically developing children to investigate the effects of head motion on differences in anisotropy and diffusivity measures between groups. We show that group differences in head motion can induce group differences in DW-MRI measures, and that this is the case even when comparing groups that include control subjects only, where no anisotropy or diffusivity differences are expected. We also show that such effects can be more prominent in some white-matter pathways than others, and that they can be ameliorated by including motion as a nuisance regressor in the analyses. Our results demonstrate the importance of taking head motion into account in any population study where one group might exhibit more head motion than the other.

10.1371/journal.pone.0053199  |  SubfieldM  |  SubfieldA  |  ResearchTypeM  |  ResearchTypeA  |   Graph theory deterministically models networks as sets of vertices, which are linked by connections. Such mathematical representation of networks, called graphs are increasingly used in neuroscience to model functional brain networks. It was shown that many forms of structural and functional brain networks have small-world characteristics, thus, constitute networks of dense local and highly effective distal information processing. Motivated by a previous small-world connectivity analysis of resting EEG-data we explored implications of a commonly used analysis approach. This common course of analysis is to compare small-world characteristics between two groups using classical inferential statistics. This however, becomes problematic when using measures of inter-subject correlations, as it is the case in commonly used brain imaging methods such as structural and diffusion tensor imaging with the exception of fibre tracking. Since for each voxel, or region there is only one data point, a measure of connectivity can only be computed for a group. To empirically determine an adequate small-world network threshold and to generate the necessary distribution of measures for classical inferential statistics, samples are generated by thresholding the networks on the group level over a range of thresholds. We believe that there are mainly two problems with this approach. First, the number of thresholded networks is arbitrary. Second, the obtained thresholded networks are not independent samples. Both issues become problematic when using commonly applied parametric statistical tests. Here, we demonstrate potential consequences of the number of thresholds and non-independency of samples in two examples (using artificial data and EEG data). Consequently alternative approaches are presented, which overcome these methodological issues.
