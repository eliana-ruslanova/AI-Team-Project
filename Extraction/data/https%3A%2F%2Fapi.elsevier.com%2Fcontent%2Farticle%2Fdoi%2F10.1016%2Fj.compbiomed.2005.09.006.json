The first method is based on a modular probabilistic network architecture that employs multiple dependant hidden Markov models (DM-HMM-D) on the input features (channels). The second method, eClass, is based on an on-line evolvable fuzzy rule base of EEG signal prototypes that represent each class and take into consideration the spatial proximity between input signals. Both approaches use supervised learning but differ in their mode of operation. eClass is designed recursively, on-line, and has an evolvable structure, while DM-HMM-D is trained off-line, in a block-based mode, and has a fixed architecture. Both methods have been extensively tested on real EEG data that is recorded during several experimental sessions involving a single female subject who is exposed to mild pain induced by a laser beam. Experimental results illustrate the viability of the proposed approaches and their potential in solving similar classification problems.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "EEG"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "HMM networks"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "On-line evolving clustering"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Evolving fuzzy rule-based classification"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010482505001022", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482505001022", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "33746787210", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-33746787210", "pubmed-id": "16298357", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33746787210", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20051118", "$": "2005-11-18"}}}}}
