We aimed to improve sensitivity and specificity of prediction methods, and to reduce the number of false alarms.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  Relative combinations of sub-band spectral powers of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings across all possible channel pairs were utilized for tracking gradual changes preceding seizures. By using a specifically developed feature selection method, a set of best candidate features were fed to support vector machines in order to discriminate cerebral state as preictal or non-preictal.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  Proposed algorithm was evaluated on continuous long-term multichannel scalp and invasive recordings (183 seizures, 3565h). The best results demonstrated a sensitivity of 75.8% (66 out of 87 seizures) and a false prediction rate of 0.1h\u2212\n                     1. Performance was validated statistically, and was superior to that of analytical random predictor.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion\n                  Applying machine learning methods on a reduced subset of proposed features could predict seizure onsets with high performance.\n               \n               \n                  Significance\n                  Our method was evaluated on long-term continuous recordings of overall about 5months, contrary to majority of previous studies using short-term fragmented data. It is of very low computational cost, while providing acceptable levels of alarm sensitivity and specificity.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Epileptic seizure prediction"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Relative spectral power"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Feature reduction"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Classification"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1388245714002971", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1388245714002971", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84921565638", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84921565638", "pubmed-id": "24969376", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84921565638", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20140604", "$": "2014-06-04"}}}}}
