ANN was employed to PERG signals to distinguish between healthy eye and diseased eye. Supervised network examined was a competitive learning vector quantization network. The designed classification structure has about 94% sensitivity, 90.32% specifity, 5.94% false negative, 9.67% false positive and correct classification is calculated to be 92%. Testing results were found to be compliant with the expected results that are derived from the physician's direct diagnosis. The end benefit would be to assist the physician to make the final decision without hesitation.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Pattern electroretinography"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial neural network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Learning vector quantization network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Optic nerve disease"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S001048250500123X", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001048250500123X", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "33750090074", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-33750090074", "pubmed-id": "16337176", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33750090074", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20051206", "$": "2005-12-06"}}}}}
