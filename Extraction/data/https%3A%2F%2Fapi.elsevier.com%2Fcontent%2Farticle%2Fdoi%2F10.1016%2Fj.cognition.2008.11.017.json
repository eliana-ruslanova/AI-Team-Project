S. (1976). Three aspects of cognitive development. Cognitive Psychology, \n                     8, 481\u2013520.] as well as the \u2018catastrophe flags\u2019 seen in data from Jansen and van der Maas [Jansen, B. R. J., & van der Maas, H. L. J. (2001). Evidence for the phase transition from Rule I to Rule II on the balance scale task. Developmental Review, 21, 450\u2013494]. The model extends a connectionist model of this task [McClelland, J. L. (1989). Parallel distributed processing: Implications for cognition and development. In R. G. M. Morris (Ed.), Parallel distributed processing: Implications for psychology and neurobiology (pp. 8\u201345). Oxford: Clarendon Press] by introducing intrinsic variability into processing and by allowing the network to adapt during testing in response to its own outputs. The simulations direct attention to several aspects of the experimental data indicating that children generally show gradual change in sensitivity to the distance dimension on the balance scale. While a few children show larger changes than are characteristic of the model, its ability to account for nearly all of the data using continuous processes is consistent with the view that the transition from Rule I to Rule II behavior is typically continuous rather than discrete in nature.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Development"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Stage transitions"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Connectionist models"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Balance scale task"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010027708002862", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027708002862", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "59649088307", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-59649088307", "pubmed-id": "19171326", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/59649088307", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20090126", "$": "2009-01-26"}}}}}
