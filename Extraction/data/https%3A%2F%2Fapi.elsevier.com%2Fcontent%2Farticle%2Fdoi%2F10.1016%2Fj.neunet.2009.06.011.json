The simultaneous use of many classes of network behaviors allows for the unsupervised learning/categorization of perceptual patterns (through input compression) and the concurrent encoding of proximities in a multidimensional space. All of these operations are achieved within a common learning operation, and using a single set of defining properties. It is shown that the model can learn categories by developing prototype representations strictly from exposition to specific exemplars. Moreover, because the model is recurrent, it can reconstruct perfect outputs from incomplete and noisy patterns. Empirical exploration of the model\u2019s properties and performance shows that its ability for adequate clustering stems from: (1) properly distributing connection weights, and (2) producing a weight space with a low dispersion level (or higher density). In addition, since the model uses a sparse representation (\n                        k\n                     -winners), the size of topological neighborhood can be fixed, and no longer requires a decrease through time as was the case with classic self-organizing feature maps. Since the model\u2019s learning and transmission parameters are independent from learning trials, the model can develop stable fixed points in a constrained topological architecture, while being flexible enough to learn novel patterns.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Bidirectional heteroassociative memory"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Competitive learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Topological architecture"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Unsupervised learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Categorization"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Self-organizing map"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608009001233", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608009001233", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "68249147915", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-68249147915", "pubmed-id": "19604669", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/68249147915", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20090630", "$": "2009-06-30"}}}}}
