Keywords Medical practice modeling knowledge-based systems Diagnostic Treatment Prognosis formalization 1 Introduction Modeling is the engineering act of producing a representation of a system for understanding, gaining an insight into the properties of that system, and predicting future outcomes. In medicine, modeling is useful in multiple tasks such as education, standardization, dissemination, innovation, and decision support [6]. Moreover, good systematic modeling of medical systems concludes with a formal model that, when applied, it may serve to improve quality, equity, optimization, and automation of processes within the modeled systems. In heath-care, medical practice (MP or the practice of medicine) is a varied and complex process that combines actions in a concrete health care setting that are performed by a set of professionals and caregivers in order to assist patients with their illnesses and ailments. This definition introduces MP at four different levels: functional (i.e., medical actions involved in MP), clinical (i.e., physical and technical requirements implementing MP), human resources (i.e., agents participating in MP), and medical case (i.e., sort of patient or disease addressed). Modeling these MP levels is seen not only as something beneficial, but also as a need in health care [14,31,10,6]. This is reflected in multiple models representing specific medical services (e.g., ER [20] or ICU [21]), tasks (e.g., diagnosis [7], treatment [8,11,16], and prognosis [34,25,1]), or diseases. However, only few studies exist that model MP at the functional level as a combination of diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic tasks. Some of them [15,27,14,31] use alternative names for MP, such as the art of medicine, the patient-centered model, the clinical procedure, the clinical methodology, or the medical function. The focus on the functional level is interesting because it provides a means for technological progress to improve medical practice. In this study, we present the results of an engineering process to construct a holistic functional model of MP for diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. The engineering process relies on a set of general hypotheses and it is composed of a sequence of steps. The hypotheses are: (1) there is a generic functional model underneath MP, (2) this model can be progressively approached and made explicit, and (3) the explicit approaches implementing the model can be supported by software technologies. The steps that we followed to construct our MP model are: (1) a systematic search of publications describing MP models, (2) integration of all the MP functional models found in a single model that we called the Medical Practice Model (MPM), (3) analysis of the medical data structures required in each component of the MPM, (4) classification of the MPM components and identification of those that are knowledge-based, (5) construction of a semantic network to organize this knowledge as explicit medical concepts and relationships, and (6) validation of the model. This commentary paper proposes MPM as a baseline for future multiple uses in different areas of medical informatics. We believe the model to be beneficial in domains such as software and knowledge engineering, machine learning, or decision support systems, and for several purposes such as medical education, research orientation, application in real settings, or incremental construction of medical knowledge-bases for decision support and automation. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 analyzes MP, Section 3 describes the MPM model with attention to the data structures, component analysis, and the sort of medical knowledge required in the model. Section 4 describes the validation tests and the limitations of the model. In Section 5, we discuss some of the capacities of the MPM model. 2 Analyzing medical practice Medical practice can be broadly described as the complex process of combining medical actions in order to provide health care to patients. It depends on multiple issues such as the treated pathology, the medical specialty, the health care setting, the patient, or the clinical technologies employed; therefore, modeling MP can be anticipated to be a difficult task. In order to understand what MP is and involves, and whether there are functional models representing MP, we performed a search of the terms medical practice, modeling medical practice, and medical practice models in Medline, PubMed, ISI WoK, and ScienceDirect. The word modeling (or model) was required to be present in the title in order to ensure that the central topic of the recovered items was the description of a model. More than two thousand documents were retrieved, and only those whose titles were judged to reflect the modeling of a medical process were kept. The number of documents was reduced to some more than four hundred which were still heterogeneous in the sorts of medical processes modeled [9,10]. At this point, the abstracts of the documents were used to identify those that were related to our interest of modeling MP. Some additional documents not recovered by the search engine but that we were aware of were also incorporated to the list. The papers included in this study can be categorized in the following groups: \u2022 Papers on how medical doctors and students practice medicine [5,6]. \u2022 Theoretical formalizations of how MP is described or expected to be [14,27,31,15,6]. \u2022 Modeling specific tasks such as diagnosis [7,30,28], medical processes [11,16,28], or prognosis [12,34,19,1,25]. \u2022 Adaptation of specific medical practices to predefined methodologies for modeling [20]. Studying these papers, resulted in the identification of recurring statements or definitions, which were therefore considered relevant to any MP model. These are: 1. The outstanding tasks of MP are prevention, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and follow-up. Among these, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis are far more fundamental [31]. 2. Diagnosis is defined as the identification of the nature of an illness or other problem by examination of the symptoms. In MP, differential diagnosis is the common process of differentiating between two or more illnesses (hypotheses) which share similar signs or symptoms. 3. Medical treatment or therapy is the medical care given to a patient for an illness or injury. Treatments can be, among other sorts, prophylactic, curative, palliative, or symptomatic. Prophylactic treatments aim at preventing the occurrence of a condition before it is observed in a patient. Curative treatments serve or tend to cure. In contrast, palliative or symptomatic treatments aim at easing the symptoms without addressing the basic cause of the disease. 1 Sometimes symptomatic treatment refers to the treatment of signs and symptoms whilst palliative treatment is related to terminal care focused on pain and distress relief. 1 4. Prognosis is the likely course and outcome of a medical condition or an experience-based opinion of the likely course of a medical condition. Nosologic prognosis [34] predicts the course of a definite disease. In contrast, individual prognosis assesses and predicts the course of a disease on a particular person. In MP, we observe three critical moments in which prognosis is recommended: during the first encounter, after diagnosis, and every time a treatment is indicated. First encounter prognosis assesses the urgency of the case and determines whether the patient requires a diagnosis, symptomatic treatment or a \u201cwait and see\u201d attitude [34]. Once a patient has been diagnosed, his (or her) evolution can be predicted with a diagnosis-based prognosis that states whether a curative treatment is recommended or not. Finally, the expected effect of a therapy on a diagnosed patient can also be assessed with a treatment-based prognosis that is compared with the real evolution of the patient in order to determine the level of success of the treatment. All the models recovered from the literature [5,6,14,27,31,15,7,30,11,16,12,34,19,1,25,20,28], together with the above mentioned main statements and definitions identified for MP, formed the input for defining our Medical Practice Model (MPM). 3 Modeling medical practice: the MPM model In Fig. 1 we present a modular description of the Medical Practice Model (MPM). In this model, medical practice begins with the elicitation process (1) where initial information for the current medical process is gathered. This information is composed of the symptoms reported by the patient and the relevant information contained in the medical record of the patient. The information will constitute the initial set of signs and symptoms that allows the physician to decide (2) whether the patient requires a diagnosis, a treatment of their signs and symptoms (i.e., symptomatic treatment), or both. Symptomatic treatment can be performed in parallel to the process of diagnosis. The signs and symptoms are employed to generate the feasible hypotheses (3) which are the possible causes of the patient health condition. Signs and symptoms can identify (4) a single hypothesis (i.e., single disease or several comorbidities) or several hypotheses (i.e., alternative diseases or comorbid conditions). The diagnostic process aims at reducing the feasible hypotheses in order to achieve a concrete diagnosis for the patient. The first step in this process consists in deciding among a set of diagnostic tests (e.g., clinical assessment, analyses, radiographies, etc.) (5), whose results may help the physician to discard or to confirm some of the available hypotheses. Sometimes these tests are organized in a diagnostic test plan (6) that describes how these tests are scheduled. Once the diagnostic test plan is generated, it is executed (7) in order to obtain additional findings. These new findings can modify or adjust the hypotheses (8). If several hypotheses are still possible (9), the diagnostic process must start again from step 5 in order to refine the hypotheses until there is only one. Observe that the remaining hypothesis can become a confirmed (or suspected) diagnosis requiring a medical intervention. Regardless whether it is confirmed or suspected, the diagnosis may be composed of one or several diseases. Moreover, even if only a single hypothesis remains, the physician may decide to continue studying the case from step 1. When there is a single confident hypothesis and the physician accepts it as the correct diagnosis of the patient, a prognosis (10) is used to determine whether the best option is to wait or to treat (11). Sometimes, a treatment may be started before the diagnostic process is concluded because some of the signs and symptoms may require attention. In this case, alternative symptomatic treatments (15) may exist, among which one of them should be selected (17). Notice that different simultaneous signs and symptoms may require different treatments. Treatments selection depends on the prognoses of the evolution of the alternatives (16). Similarly, if the diseases diagnosed for the patient have to be treated, the possible curative treatments (12) and their respective prognoses (13) are used to decide the best curative treatment possible for each diagnosis (14). The simultaneous application of several treatment plans may entail multiple problems, among which repetitions and interactions are critical. Repetitions happen when the same medical action (e.g., blood analysis or monitoring) appears in more than one plan and it is unnecessarily performed several times. Interactions occur when different actions in different plans have some medical interference (e.g., when a treatment with anticoagulants has to be combined with a surgical treatment, anticoagulant drugs must be suppressed). In order to avoid these sorts of problems, symptomatic and curative treatments have to be combined in a single treatment (18). Once the unified treatment has been determined, a new prognosis (19) provides the information to decide about the appropriate follow-up plan (e.g., next appointments) (20). A follow-up plan is also required if the decision in 11 was not to provide a curative treatment but to wait for the patient evolution. In this case, prognosis in 19 is the same as the one generated in 10. Once the follow-up plan is decided, the treatment is executed (21). The results of the treatment, along with the expected results, allow the physician to determine whether the treatment followed by the patient is being successful or not (22). Sometimes, this decision depends on the results of some tests or monitored data. If the treatment is successful and the patient is cured, he (or she) is discharged. For chronic diseases, the patient will never be discharged but involved in a follow-up loop to keep his (or her) health stable (23) as much time as possible. On the contrary, if the treatment is unsuccessful the whole process must be reconsidered from step 1. 3.1 The MPM data With regard to the information that the MPM modules require and generate, we may distinguish between eleven different medical data types (see Table 1 ). The patient condition is all the information available about a patient that describes his (or her) state of health. It is mainly composed of the signs and symptoms observed, the findings during professional examination, and the information in the health care record of the patient that is related to the health problem addressed. Diagnostic hypothesis is any of the diagnoses that may explain the current patient condition. Usually, when only a single diagnostic hypothesis exists, this one becomes a final diagnosis. Both, a diagnostic hypothesis and a final diagnosis can involve a single disease or several comorbid diseases. Diagnostic test is any test that is used to help decision-making during differential diagnosis. A diagnostic test plan is a temporal sequence describing the order in which a set of diagnostic tests must be performed. Its execution is expected to provide additional information about the patient condition, in order to progress in determining the patient diagnosis. Therefore, a diagnostic test result has a structure that is equivalent to the structure of the patient condition; i.e., a set of signs and symptoms. The diagnostic procedure concludes when all the hypotheses but one are discarded and the remaining hypothesis is accepted as the patient diagnosis. With this single diagnosis, practitioners have to foresee the feasible evolution of the diseases diagnosed and decide whether the best option is to start a treatment or to wait and observe the natural evolution of the patient. We call this prediction diagnosis-based prognosis, which is modeled as a single-point estimation [25] of the time elapsed until a patient condition is reached. That is to say, the expected time till a set of symptoms are observed or relieved. MPM distinguishes between curative and symptomatic treatments. Whether curative or symptomatic, a treatment is a set of health care actions such as pharmacological prescriptions, radiological and analytical orders, counsel and recommendations, nursing actions, etc. When several treatments coexist in the same patient, they are merged in a single treatment which is adjusted to the patient needs. Then the practitioner prognosticates the effects of this treatment for the patient\u2019s current condition in order to decide on a follow-up plan. Here, we call this prognosis the treatment-based prognosis and it replaces the previous diagnostic-based prognosis, which is less informed since it does not consider the treatment followed but just the diagnosis. Like diagnosis-based prognosis, treatment-based prognosis is seen as a single-point estimation of the time to reach a concrete patient condition [25]. This prediction is required to generate a proper follow-up plan that schedules the next encounter between the physician and the patient. This encounter should not be too soon in order to allow the treatment enough time to start changing the patient\u2019s condition, and it should not be too late to prevent one from detecting and correcting undesired evolutions. In the next encounter, the physician can be a GP or a specialist, if it is required. The above medical data types, summarized in Table 1, describe clinical data that are expressed in terms of five basic medical concepts: signs and symptoms, diseases, tests, treatment actions, and specialties; and two formal structures: partial orders [3] and time [36]. 3.2 The MPM components The resulting 24 components of the MPM model were analyzed in terms of the medical data they manage (among the ones described in Table 1), making a distinction between data that they require and data that they generate, and whether the interventions of the patient, the physician, or health care knowledge are required (y) or not (n). Table 2 summarizes the results of this analysis. Notice that the column patient contains y/n in those components in which the intervention of the patient is optional (e.g., some medical decisions such as therapy selection may be made considering patient preferences or just based on medical evidence). We also observe that components 14 and 17 are equivalent, and component 3 is a particular case of component 8 in which the set of diagnostic hypotheses is empty. The column physician shows that physicians participate in almost all of the stages of the MPM model. Moreover, their participation is always based on medical knowledge except in elicitation which, in the MPM, is seen as the process of gathering all the initial symptoms reported by the patient and the relevant information contained in the patient\u2019s record. Any other sign observed by the physician is part of the differential diagnostic loop. 3.3 The MPM knowledge According to the input and output of the MPM components and the function that they perform, these may require diverse sorts of medical knowledge. Our analysis of the MPM components determines a list of questions that a physician is faced with in medical practice. These questions represent medical problems that medical informatics technologies should help to solve. These questions are enumerated in Table 3 and they give us an insight into the sorts of knowledge that are managed in medical practice: knowledge about diagnosing (questions 1\u20133), knowledge about therapeutics (4\u20139), knowledge about patient and disease evolution (10\u201311), knowledge about medical reconsiderations (12 and 13), and clinical knowledge (14 and 15). In the table, in parenthesis, we provide the number of the MPM component of Fig. 1 solving each question. Part of the information required to answer some of the questions in Table 3 may be optional. For example, the patient condition is optional in question six. Optional information appears between brackets both in the questions and in Table 2. The sort of information involved in a question is important because it conditions the sort of knowledge needed to answer that question. In order to organize all the expert knowledge required to answer all these questions, we carried out a knowledge engineering process. Starting with the sort of information that each MPM component requires and generates while solving each question (see Table 2), the relationship between these sorts of information was explicitly incorporated to a growing semantic network. For example, MPM component 3 (i.e., generate diagnostic hypothesis) addresses question 2 (i.e., given a patient condition, which are the diagnostic hypotheses that may explain that condition?). So, the medical knowledge required to answer questions of this kind must be based on the relationships between patient conditions and diagnostic hypotheses (i.e., explains (X, Y), where X is a diagnostic hypothesis, and Y is a patient condition). The process was repeated for all the MPM components in Fig. 1 and questions in Table 3. The methods explained in [24] were used to represent n-ary relationships, with n > 2 . The knowledge engineering process concluded with the semantic network depicted in Fig. 2 in which several kinds of medical concepts are related: \u2022 Basic concepts representing signs and symptoms, tests, diseases, (treatment) actions, and medical specialties. Standard coding systems such as ICD10CM, ICPC, ATC, or SNOMED-CT exist that classify such concepts. \u2022 Patient-oriented concepts representing patient conditions, diagnoses, diagnostic tests (as sets of clinical tests), treatments (either symptomatic or curative), prognoses (either diagnostic-based, or treatment-based), and follow-up plans (as schedules on the next visits to a health care professional). \u2022 Decision concepts representing the medical decisions of whether to study, refine or treat (question 13), 2 Question 13 has three possible answers: study, refine, or treat (see 9 in Fig. 1); but knowledge is only used to decide between to study or to treat when a single diagnostic hypothesis is reached. If several diagnoses are still possible, the decision is always to refine. If the diagnostic tests discard all the hypothesis, the decision is also to study. 2 to wait or to treat (question 12), and to discharge, to continue treatment or to reconsider the treatment (question 7). \u2022 Decision-support concepts representing evolutions of care and diagnostic results. Two of the three medical decisions in the previous item involve several medical concepts that are interconnected with n-ary relations which require the introduction of additional concepts [24]. Deciding whether to study or to treat, in question 132 is based on the accumulation of knowledge of the sort \u2018patients with a health condition c and a single diagnostic hypothesis h require X\u2019, with X either \u2018further study\u2019 or \u2018treatment\u2019. In Fig. 2, diagnostic result is the concept that joins these three elements ( c , h , X ) . Similarly, during follow-up physicians have to decide (question 7) whether to discharge the patient (i.e., the treatment succeeded), to continue with the treatment (i.e., the treatment is beneficial) or to reconsider the treatment (i.e., the treatment is not obtaining the expected good results). This knowledge has the form \u2018patients following a treatment for which a prognosis p was determined and who evolved from a health condition c 1 to a health condition c 2 are X\u2019, with X either \u2018discharged\u2019, \u2018continuing treatment\u2019, or \u2018reconsidered\u2019. Here, the concept evolution in Fig. 2 combines these four pieces of information ( p , c 1 , c 2 , X ) . The semantic network in Fig. 2 must be seen as an explicit representation of the sort of medical knowledge that can answer all the sorts of medical questions in Table 3 (i.e., a conceptual model), and not necessarily as a knowledge structure to reason with. The knowledge is explicit and incremental in the sense that, for example, if we know that \u2018fever, cough, and thoracic pain can be the consequence of pneumonia\u2019, this knowledge should be incorporated in the network as an explicit relationship explains(pneumonia, {fever, cough, thoracic-pain}), with pneumonia an instance of the concept diagnosis, and {fever, cough, thoracic-pain} an instance of patient condition in Fig. 2. Notice that before the semantic network can be used we have to instantiate it with concrete medical knowledge about particular diseases and the medical setting where the MPM model is going to be applied. This instantiation is part of the progressive nature of the MPM modeling that we stated in the introduction. 4 Validation of the model The MPM model is the result of the collaboration between several members of the Department of CS and Mathematics at the Universitat Rovira i Virgili (Spain) and a senior GP from the Group for Health and Social Assistance (SAGESSA) in the south of Catalonia (Spain). The model is constructed after reviewing technical bibliography in the topic of MP modeling and also considering the long experience of the GP involved in the process. Once a model was obtained and in order to check whether it is a practical model with capacity to describe medical actuations that involve diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic tasks, we performed two types of validations: (1) we searched for published medical cases and compared their respective managements with the clinical behavior proposed by MPM and (2) we searched for other health care knowledge-based systems and checked whether their proposed solutions could fit in the functionality provided by MPM. 4.1 Validation with medical cases Clinical cases from four sources were used to validate the MPM model. These sources are Fisterra, the Journal of Medical Case Reports (JMCR), some of the references used for the preparation of the MPM model, and the medical records of SAGESSA between 2005 and 2010. Fisterra (www.fisterra.com) is an Elsevier web page for health care professionals providing updated information about primary care in Spanish. Among other resources, Fisterra provides a database of clinical cases selected from specialized publications. The JMCR (www.jmedicalcasereports.com) is a peer-reviewed online journal publishing original medical cases catering to general medicine professionals. Four of the references used during the preparation of the MPM model [6,5,18,4] contain descriptions of clinical cases that were also used to validate the model. Finally, the databases of SAGESSA (www.grupsagessa.com) were used to extract long term treatments of cases of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, hypercholesterolemia, and ischaemic heart disease. Fifteen cases from Fisterra, 35 cases from JMCR, 10 cases from [6,5,18,4], and 50 cases from SAGESSA were used to check whether their real treatments follow the medical practice represented by the MPM model. These cases included the management of chronic patients (68%) and acute patients (32%). They required one or more health services: primary care (59%), hospitalization (35%), surgical actions (16%), emergency (5%), and ICU (3%). Some cases described patients whose health problem was analyzed, then diagnosed, treated and, optionally, followed up; some other cases were patients with past diagnoses whose diseases reappeared; some others where cases of unsuccessful treatments that had to be changed; some patients were treated with curative treatments, some others with symptomatic treatments, or with a combination of both, and some cases described diagnostic processes running in parallel to symptomatic treatments. Fifty-five patients were involved in a diagnostic procedure, 92 were involved in some sort of curative treatment, 24 in a symptomatic treatment, in 13 cases some sort of prognosis was explicitly reported, and 66 patients required follow-up. The mean duration of the cases was one year for chronic patients and 7.8months for acute patients (including surgical actions). The proportion of females was 48%. With regard to age, four patients were under 16, 9 were between 17 and 30, 37 were between 30 and 60, and 60 were older than 60. They were affected by one or several health problems (30% of comorbid patients): respiratory (56), cardio-vascular (44), circulatory (12), tumors (10), glandular (4), digestive (2), hepatic (2), nephrotic (2), and others (9). With all these cases, we analyzed their courses of care in comparison to the medical practice paths described by the MPM model, and observed that MPM was able to represent all the medical practices observed for chronic and acute patients, and most of the cases on surgical actions. However, this analysis allowed us to detect some limitations of the MPM model that we discuss in Section 4.3. In Table 4 , we show the percentage of cases that follow some of the main loops in the MPM model; that is to say, the differential diagnostic loop (DDL) corresponding to the connection between component 9 and 5 in Fig. 1, the treatment selection loops (TSL) or MPM component connections 14\u201312 and 17\u201315, the follow-up loop (FUL) or connection 23\u201319, and the re-elicitation loops (REL) represented by connections 9\u20131 and 24\u20131. Observe that 13% of the cases receive a medical care that is not involved in any loop. These are cases in which diagnosis and treatment are clear and they required no follow-up. On the contrary 60% of the cases describe differential diagnostic loops, but only 31% of the cases followed just a diagnostic loop and no other MPM loops. For treatment selection, 20% of the studied patients were involved in a loop to decide on a treatment, while only 9% participated in this sort of loop, exclusively. Among all the patients, only 4% implied complex medical practices in which all the types of MPM loops were followed. 4.2 Validation with other models and systems The MPM model is the result of the integration of previous published descriptions and formalizations of medical practice [5,6,14,27,31,15,7,30,11,16,12,34,19,1,25,20]. This integration was made following an inclusive approach that caused the MPM model to be a generalization, but also an extension of those other models. The inclusion of these models in the MPM was doubly validated by three independent GPs who confirmed MPM as more explicit, complete and general than those other models, as far as diagnosis, treatment, and relevant prognoses are concerned. They also agreed with the sorts of medical data identified in the model (see Table 1) and with how these data were used in the different MPM components (see Table 2). They were also particularly satisfied with questions in Table 3. According to two GPs the list included important questions of daily medical practice, but also some others that they were not aware of during clinical assistance because they solved them unconsciously. These questions were mainly 1, sometimes 2, 4, and 14. Besides models, many systems exist that provide computer-based solutions to medical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment, or prognosis alone, but we are not aware of computer systems supporting MP as an integrated combination of all of them. However, during our bibliographic search we found some systems such as [23,13,32] that combine some of these tasks. Specifically, [23] introduces an algorithm for non-invasive breast cancer treatment that begins with the selection of the patient clinical stage, then the set of clinical tests (i.e., mammogram physical examination, biopsy, or measure of hormone receptor in tumor) to obtain additional findings in order to determine the most appropriate primary treatment. The process concludes with a postsurgical treatment, and a surveillance or follow up step. According to the MPM model this algorithm is implemented with the sequence of components 1\u201314 followed by 18\u201320 in Fig. 1, where all prognoses are omitted. The algorithm in [23] is therefore contained in MPM. In [13], a computer system for chronic diseases is described that receives the medical data of a patient and uses it to predict the probabilities of four specific chronic diseases. This prediction is called prognosis in the paper in spite that medicine calls this a diagnostic process. Then if the patient requires a course of therapy, the system seeks the most similar case contained in a database of previous cases and shows the treatment that this patient received. The authors argued that this information was helpful for the doctor to decide on the treatment of the new patient. This system implements the sequence of MPM steps 1\u20134 followed by 9\u201314, with omission of MPM prognoses and therefore it is also contained in the MPM model. The same happens with racer [32] which is used to prescribe the most appropriate drugs for a particular patient. The information about the patient is filtered to a selected set of attributes, then a knowledge base is used, on the one hand, to retrieve previous similar cases and on the other hand to detect associations between this information and drugs in previous cases. The information obtained by the two technologies is finally combined to provide a list of recommended drugs. Leaving technological issues aside, the medical process implemented by racer goes from information elicitation to a treatment recommendation which is equivalent to the symptomatic treatment represented by the steps 1\u20132, followed by 15 in the MPM model, where 15 is restricted to only recommend a single treatment. Other interesting systems addressing the problem of differential diagnosis are the Present Illness Program (PIP) [26] and INTERNIST-I [22]. These systems use the signs and symptoms of the patient to detect feasible diagnostic hypotheses. In these systems, the hypotheses are accepted or discarded if a certain upper or lower threshold that evaluates the matching are respectively met. Otherwise, some unsolved signs and symptoms of the most promising hypothesis are then selected to be asked to the user of the system. The process iterates till some hypothesis is accepted or all of them are discarded. Relationships between diseases exist that make the reasoning process knowledge-based and closer to the differential diagnosis carried out by physicians. In MPM the process is slightly different because signs and symptoms are used to identify feasible hypotheses, like PIP and INTERNIST-I, but the hypotheses are not used to identify missing facts, but to detect the diagnostic tests that have to be performed in order to solve the missing facts. This difference causes that relationships of the sort disease-disease are not required in Fig. 2, but they are in PIP and in INTERNIST-I. 4.3 Limitations of the MPM During the validation of the MPM model with real clinical cases and in comparison to other published medical models and systems, we noticed some limitations of the model. We classify them, according to their cause, into: \u2022 Clinical purpose of the model: MPM was designed to represent regular assistance to health care patients with regard to the medical tasks of diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. This entails some constraints that are not valid for other medical actions such as prophylaxis, planning and running clinical trials, or post-mortem actions. The MPM model can also fail to represent concrete details of some surgical procedures, although it still models the common sequence: pretreatment test, surgical intervention, postoperative care, and follow up. \u2022 Prognosis in the model: Prognosis is a complex concept in MP [12,34,19,1,25] that covers many different sorts of medical predictions. The MPM model incorporates three sorts of prognoses, diagnostic-based and treatment-based which correspond to explicit knowledge in the semantic network (see them as concepts in Fig. 2), and first encounter prognosis which is implicitly represented with component 2 in Fig. 1 and the possibility of defining a \u201cdo-nothing\u201d treatment in 15. According to the reviewed literature, these prognoses are the ones far more used in MP, but there are other sorts such as anticipating the evolution of signs and symptoms, or predicting nosocomial or related diseases, that are not part of the model. Since they are not central to MP, we decided not to include them in MPM. \u2022 Data in the model: Although the sorts of medical data managed by the MPM model are fully supported by all the validation tests performed, for some of these sorts of data we found alternative structures to the ones proposed in Table 1. In particular, treatments are defined in the model as a set of medical actions, but some other papers propose alternative more complex representations such as clinical algorithms, flowcharts, or pathways [8,16,33]. Also in the model, prognoses are described as the time required for the patient to reach a concrete health condition, while other alternative representations exist ranging from quantitative and probabilistic approaches to symbolic and qualitative ones [1,25]. All the previously discussed limitations are due to either the sort of medical practice addressed (i.e., combination of diagnosis, treatment and prognosis) or to the structure selected to represent treatments and prognoses within the model. In the first case limitations must be interpreted as the adaptation of the model to the sort of medical practice that we want to formalize. It is hardly surprising that the model could fail describing some medical cases that are not targeted or that involve other than diagnostic, therapeutic or prognostic tasks. With regard to the treatment and prognostic structures, during validation, the consulted physicians agreed that in spite of the alternatives, our representation of treatment as a list of medical actions, and prognosis as a time to reach a patient condition are valid, according to their experience and work methods. 5 Discussion and future work Although medical practice, or the practice of medicine, can be heterogeneous and complex [17], there is a general agreement that behind this heterogeneity and complexity there are some behaviors that are common to good medical practice [6]. Some theoretical studies have tried to provide conceptual analyses of how some of the most important tasks of MP (such as diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis) work and interact [7,35,12,14,34,5,31,2]. In their turn, medical informaticians have worked to provide partial models of MP [20,21,16], but also to develop computer-based technologies, tools and systems to support health care practitioners in some medical practices [19,25,13,32], but not as a whole process. The development of a holistic model for MP forms therefore an unsolved challenge. When a holistic model is designed as a formal, incremental, modular, and computer-oriented model it can be beneficial to both medicine and medical informatics. Specifically, it may help understanding and describing MP for medical purposes such as education and standardization. In addition, it may contribute to the evolution of computer-based prediction and management in medicine. According to [17], understanding, describing, predicting and managing are fundamental goals for individuals who work within complex systems like MP, as well as for those who study them. In this commentary paper we proposed MPM, a semi-formal medical practice model which is integrative and incremental in its conception (i.e., MPM blends and extends previous partial models and it allows future extensions such as considering additional sorts of prognosis). The MPM components, the data types, and the semantic network that are described in the paper provide a formalization of the model at the levels of the information involved and the sort of knowledge required. Although the derivation and the validation of the model include some subjective considerations, we believe the proposed model to be beneficial to others. Any MPM component can be considered alone or connected with other neighboring components in Fig. 1. The model does not impose any sort of restriction on the contents of the MPM components, therefore, MPM can be interesting in multiple technological fields or medical settings. For example, in software engineering, components can contain specialized programs performing the medical actions or answering the medical questions related to each particular MPM component; in knowledge engineering, components can represent knowledge acquisition methodologies or medical knowledge bases related to the medical function of each MPM component, using different representation paradigms (e.g., rules, ontologies, etc.); in machine learning, MPM components can contain programs that automatically learn decision models to solve the task performed by each component, with different technologies (e.g., decision trees, Bayesian networks, etc.), and in decision support the MPM components can contain computer systems that reason with validated knowledge structures to help physicians in MP (e.g., case-based reasoners, computer-interpretable guidelines, etc.). Due to modularity (see Fig. 1 and Table 2), not all the MPM components need to be implemented with the same technology or at the same time. So, for example, if elicitation is better implemented with information system technologies, decisions (e.g., components 2, 4, or 9) with expert systems, and prognostic components with Bayesian networks, these technologies can be used in different parts of the MPM model to provide an optimal system. If a new technology or software is published that outperforms previous solutions, we can incorporate it to the system improving the quality of MP. Also, in particular medical domains (e.g., breast pathology) the model can be used as a puzzle-game in which the different pieces (or MPM components in Fig. 1) are gathered as soon as computer-based successful solutions for the different parts of the model are available. The incorporation, update or upgrade of new technologies and knowledge in the MPM components could contribute to the progress, standardization, and education of medical practice and its automation with medical informatics. For this purpose, we have started the implementation of the model as Java classes and the design of the different sorts of decision tables to codify the semantic network in Fig. 2 [29], in order to obtain a holistic decision support system for high blood pressure.
