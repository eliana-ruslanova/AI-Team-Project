Digestive Disease Center Showa University Northern Yokohama Hospital 35-1 Tuzuki Yokohama Kanagawa 224-8503 Japan Background and Aims In the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC), an incremental benefit of achieving histologic healing beyond that of endoscopic mucosal healing has been suggested; persistent histologic inflammation increases the risk of exacerbation and dysplasia. However, identification of persistent histologic inflammation is extremely difficult using conventional endoscopy. Furthermore, the reproducibility of endoscopic disease activity is poor. We developed and evaluated a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to predict persistent histologic inflammation using endocytoscopy (EC; 520-fold ultra-magnifying endoscope). Methods We evaluated the accuracy of the CAD system using test image sets. First, we retrospectively reviewed the data of 187 patients with UC from whom biopsy samples were obtained after endocytoscopic observation. EC images and biopsy samples of each patient were collected from 6 colorectal segments: cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum. All EC images were tagged with reference to the biopsy sample\u2019s histologic activity. For validation samples, 525 validation sets of 525 independent segments were collected from 100 patients, and 12,900 EC images from the remaining 87 patients were used for machine learning to construct CAD. The primary outcome measure was the diagnostic ability of CAD to predict persistent histologic inflammation. Its reproducibility for all test images was also assessed. Results CAD provided diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy as follows: 74% (95% confidence interval, 65%-81%), 97% (95% confidence interval, 95%-99%), and 91% (95% confidence interval, 83%-95%), respectively. Its reproducibility was perfect (\u03ba = 1). Conclusions Our CAD system potentially allows fully automated identification of persistent histologic inflammation associated with UC. Graphical abstract Abbreviations CAD computer-aided diagnosis EC endocytoscopy MES Mayo endoscopic score NBI narrow-band imaging NPV negative predictive value PPV positive predictive value UC ulcerative colitis WLE white-light endoscopy Endoscopic mucosal healing is an important treatment goal that predicts better outcomes of ulcerative colitis (UC). 1 Studies have suggested an incremental benefit of achieving histologic healing in that persistent histologic inflammation is associated with an increased risk of clinical exacerbation and colorectal dysplasia beyond that of endoscopic mucosal healing. 2-4 However, some studies have suggested that conventional white-light endoscopy (WLE) cannot reliably identify persistent histologic inflammation. 5,6 Advanced endoscopic imaging technologies, including narrow-band imaging (NBI; Olympus Corp, Tokyo, Japan), i-Scan (Pentax Medical, Tokyo, Japan), and a confocal laser endomicroscope (Pentax Medical), have been used to predict histologic activity with proven excellent diagnostic performance. 6-9 Endocytoscopy (EC; CF Y-0058-I prototype and H290ECI; Olympus Corp), which is performed with a 520-fold ultra-magnifying contact microscope, is comparable with other advanced technologies in terms of prediction of histologic severity. 10-12 However, such accuracy using these technologies has been achieved only by experts. Furthermore, interobserver variation in categorizing endoscopic disease activity is widely suspected. 13,14 To address these issues, we developed a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system that supports both novice and experienced endoscopists in grading UC-related mucosal inflammation (Video 1, available online at www.giejournal.org). This retrospective study was undertaken to validate our CAD model, which was designed to differentiate histologically active versus histologically healing UC-induced inflammation. Methods Study design We evaluated the accuracy and performance of the CAD system by using test image sets. We first prepared validation images to assess CAD and training images to construct CAD based on periodic sequences. The study group comprised 187 patients from whom biopsy samples were obtained after EC observation of patients with UC from October 2016 to April 2018. Total colonoscopy and routine observation were performed in the conventional WLE mode to determine the Mayo endoscopic score (MES) 15 and define the target area, which was the most severely inflamed area in the segment. EC images of the selected section were taken using the ultra-magnifying mode (details of EC are described in Endocytoscopy, below). A biopsy sample was then obtained from the section for histologic analysis of the same area. Both EC images and biopsy samples of each patient were obtained from 6 colorectal segments: cecum; ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon; and rectum. For the validation samples, 525 test sets of 525 segments were collected from 100 patients from October 6, 2016 to December 8, 2017. A test set included all EC images and 1 biopsy sample obtained from a section. In total, 9935 EC images were used for the validation samples. The exclusion criterion was the presence of significantly dark and blurred images (eg, insufficient contact or multiple artifacts caused by the presence of mucus or bleeding). Another 87 patients from December 13, 2017 to April 30, 2018 were used for machine learning of CAD. The machine learning samples comprised 12,900 EC images (Fig. 1 ). The diagnostic performance of CAD was assessed with reference to the biopsy sample\u2019s histologic activity. In this retrospective study, informed consent was obtained by an \u201copt-out\u201d method: Sufficient information was provided by distributing documents before colonoscopy and disclosing information on the bulletin board and website of the facility, and the absence of patients\u2019 refusal to participate was defined as agreement to participate. The Ethics Committee of Showa University Northern Yokohama Hospital waived the requirement for written consent. The EC used in this study (CF Y-0058-I and H290ECI) are standard colonoscopes that have received regulatory approval from the Japanese government, and the procedures applied were in compliance with standard endoscopic practice. The Ethics Committee of Showa University Northern Yokohama Hospital approved the study protocol (no. 17H009) and registered it as a UMIN clinical trial (UMIN 000027307). The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Endocytoscopy An integrated-type EC (CF Y-0058-I prototype and H290ECI; Olympus Corp) commercially available in Europe, the Middle East, Hong Kong, and Japan was used to acquire all endoscopic images. EC involves the use of a contact light microscopy system with ultra-magnification capability (\u00d7520) integrated into the distal tip. The appearance of the endocytoscope is almost the same as an ordinary endoscope (Fig. 2 A). The EC has 2 separate observation modes: standard WLE mode and ultra-magnifying mode. Using a hand-operated lever, endoscopists can consecutively perform ultra-magnifying observations in addition to WLE without changing the endoscope. EC combined with NBI observation allows visualization of microvessels on the colorectal mucosa (Fig. 3 ) and was used to construct and validate the present CAD model. By pushing a switch on the handle, endoscopists can immediately use the NBI mode without dye staining. The use of NBI is a standard practice in performing EC. The effectiveness of using NBI has already been evaluated for both identifying colorectal adenoma 16 and evaluating the inflammatory activity of UC, 11 and Olympus Corp also officially recommends its use as an important option. CAD algorithm We previously described a CAD system to analyze EC images (EB-01; Cybernet Systems Co, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) that allows automated differential diagnosis between neoplastic and non-neoplastic polyps. 17-19 Based on this model, we refined software that allowed us to stratify the colorectal mucosa of patients with UC and achieved 2 innovative improvements. First, in the current study, the new EC (Y-0058-I) produced by Olympus Corp has a slightly protruding lens compared with the previous prototype EC, making it easier to ensure contact of the lens with a flat area (eg, normal mucosa), not just protruding lesions (Fig. 2A). This modification has already been applied to models currently available on the market (CF-H290ECI). Thus, we could more easily obtain images from normal mucosa. Additionally, the image quality was enhanced to high definition, allowing us to obtain remarkably distinct images. Second, the new software algorithm increased the number of extracted features. The number of features extracted from an EC image was increased from 291 using the previous model to 312 in the present study. Overall, 312 features on an EC image were extracted to construct the CAD system by texture analysis, which can quantify any image as multiple values. A support vector machine, the most common classifier in machine learning, was used and output a 2-category diagnosis (\u201cactive\u201d or \u201chealing\u201d) based on the extracted features. The predicted histologic inflammatory status was displayed together with the probability of the output (50%-100%) (Fig. 4 ). This CAD system is directly connected to an endoscopy unit (Evis Lucera Elite; Olympus Corp), allowing instant output of real-time automated diagnoses by simply pushing the capture button of the endoscope to acquire an image. Histologic assessment Experienced pathologists who were blinded to the endoscopy results assessed the biopsy samples using the Geboes score, a grading system commonly used in clinical trials and routine clinical practice 20 predictive of disease relapse. 21 The samples were divided into 2 groups according to the final histologic indices: \u201chistologic active\u201d and \u201chistologic healing.\u201d Our definition of histologic active samples (indicating persistent histologic inflammation) was a score of \u22653.1 and that of histologic healing samples (indicating no persistent histologic inflammation) a score of \u22643.0. 22 A total of 22,835 EC images collected for machine learning and validation were tagged according to these histologic criteria, which were considered the criterion standard. Outcome measures In the present study, we performed 3 comparisons: CAD versus histologic inflammatory activity per segment, CAD versus histologic inflammatory activity per segment with a MES of 0 or 1, and CAD versus histologic inflammatory activity per patient. CAD for overall test segments (main outcome measures) We evaluated the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the CAD system for predicting histologically active segments (persistent histologic inflammation). Because we captured multiple EC images from 1 segment, CAD diagnosis of a location was obtained by majority rule (eg, if a segment had 5 active outputs and 2 healing outputs, the location was deemed active). CAD for segments with a MES of 0 or 1 We also assessed the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV of the CAD system in limited segments with a MES of 0 or 1. CAD for per-patient assessment Finally, we evaluated the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV of the CAD system for predicting patients\u2019 histologically active status (per patient histologic assessment). The CAD of a patient was defined as follows: active = 1 or more segments were active outputs, and healing = all segments were healing outputs. The diagnosis output rate, time, and reproducibility were also assessed. Intraobserver agreement between the first and second CADs on 9935 EC images was calculated using the \u03ba value. Results Clinicopathologic features of validation sets Table 1 shows the clinicopathologic features of 525 segments for validation sets collected from 100 patients with UC by 5 experienced endoscopists. The histologic active (Geboes score \u22653.1) rate was 26%. A MES of 0, 1, and \u22642 was obtained in 71%, 15%, and 14% of cases, respectively. The evaluated internal location was almost equal among the 6 segments. One hundred patients were included in the validation sets. The histologic active rate was 59%. With respect to the types of UC, extensive colitis occurred in 62% of patients, left-sided colitis in 24%, and proctitis in 14%. Main outcome measure CAD for overall test segments The overall diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV for predicting persistent histologic inflammation were 74% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65%-81%), 97% (95% CI, 95%-99%), 91% (95% CI, 88%-93%), 90% (95% CI, 83%-95%), and 91% (95% CI, 88%-93%), respectively (Tables 2 and 3 ). Secondary outcome measures CAD for segments with a MES of 0 or 1 In limited segments with a MES of 0 or 1 (454/525), the corresponding values of overall diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV for predicting persistent histologic inflammation were 65% (95% CI, 54%-75%), 98% (95% CI, 94%-99%), 91% (95% CI, 88%-94%), 87% (95% CI, 76%-94%), and 92% (95% CI, 89%-95%), respectively (Tables 2 and 3). CAD for per-patient assessment The corresponding values of overall diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV for predicting an active inflammatory status were 86% (95% CI, 75%-94%), 93% (95% CI, 80%-99%), 89% (95% CI, 81%-94%), 94% (95% CI, 85%-99%), and 83% (95% CI, 69%-92%), respectively (Tables 2 and 3). CAD system performance The CAD system successfully provided diagnosis outputs for 100% (9985/9985) of the validation images with a diagnosis time of .4 seconds per image. Interobserver agreement between the first and second CAD diagnoses was perfect (\u03ba = 1). Discussion With recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, there is growing interest in the implementation of CAD systems as a novel approach to improve the quality of GI endoscopy. 23,24 Our study appears to be the first to validate a CAD system that exhibits a good diagnostic ability to predict persistent histologic inflammation in patients with UC. According to the established American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline, if no dysplastic lesions are detected during surveillance colonoscopy of UC, clinicians can consider 2 biopsy specimens from each colon segment for histologic staging. 25 This biopsy protocol helps to establish the most appropriate medical therapy and stratifies the risks of exacerbation and dysplasia. The concept of optical biopsy sampling was recently introduced in the field of GI endoscopy to achieve a real-time diagnosis or to reduce the patient\u2019s medical cost or burden on the pathologist. A contact microscope for optical biopsy sampling (confocal laser endomicroscope; Pentax Medical) has been proven promising in the real-time assessment of inflammatory severity in patients with UC. 9,26,27 However, it is a time-consuming and high-cost approach. EC is another technique for contact microscopy for optical biopsy sampling, and it has been used to evaluate the severity of inflammation and predict exacerbation in patients with UC. 10-12 In the present study, we used EC combined with the NBI mode. Compared with use of the confocal laser endomicroscope, this combination method has the advantage of switching from conventional WLE with the push of a button without extra time or cost. In a previous prospective study, 28 the median time required to obtain an EC image was 19 seconds using the NBI mode, which is not considered to interfere with routine examination. In the segment-based analysis of the present study, our CAD system using EC images identified persistent histologic inflammation with 74% sensitivity, 97% specificity, and 91% accuracy overall. The specificity and accuracy were excellent despite the diagnosis time of .4 seconds per image and perfect reproducibility (\u03ba = 1). We tolerated the 74% sensitivity of our CAD system considering the difficulty of identifying histologic inflammation with endoscopy, which is still considered inadequate to reduce the number of biopsy specimens. Even if the sensitivity further increases, biopsy samples will likely still be needed to rule out alternate causes (eg, infections such as Clostridium difficile colitis and cytomegalovirus colitis) of exacerbating activity. In the patient-based analysis, our CAD system using EC images achieved 86% sensitivity, 93% specificity, and 89% accuracy for patients\u2019 histologic activity. CAD has the potential to support immediate therapeutic decisions and predict long-term outcomes. Hence, improvement in diagnostic ability is expected by further accumulation of learning images. We are currently refining the algorithm and collecting a large library of learning images. In the present experimental study, only a single data set was used. According to the TRIPOD statements 29 (official statements for evaluating a prediction model), in the development and validation of a prediction model using only a single data set, it is important to split the data by time to develop a model using data from 1 period and evaluate its performance using the data from the other period; the order is not prescribed. We initially obtained comprehensive images; later, we intentionally collected specific images that we had not been able to obtain earlier. Therefore, we considered the images collected earlier to be more well balanced as validation samples. Our CAD system has 3 main strengths. First, images from all colorectal segments were assessed. Our new CAD system could accommodate all segments of the colorectum despite their variability and heterogeneity. This allows for assessment of not only disease severity but also extent, a parameter that predicts long-term outcomes. Second, many reports on CAD in the field of GI endoscopy have been published. However, because it is usually necessary to manually designate the region of interest when using a conventional endoscope, it is considered extremely difficult to develop practical and real-time moving CAD. Because the region of interest of the EC image is a full-screen image, manual setting is not required and full automation is possible, which is a great advantage in the introduction and implementation of CAD in clinical practice. Third, its reproducibility was perfect (\u03ba = 1). Endoscopic evaluation of inflammation activity is subject to high reproducibility. However, the reproducibility of endoscopic assessment is poor, particularly among trainees (\u03ba = .41-.51). 14 Technically, the interobserver reproducibility of CAD is not expected to be anything less than k = 1. However, the perfect (\u03ba = 1) reproducibility of our system is a strong point for the clinical application of CAD. Therefore, to emphasize and confirm the data, we evaluated all validation samples twice. We believe this perfect reproducibility will be valuable for endoscopists in both the clinical and research settings. The study also has limitations. First, all EC image samples for validation were collected by only 5 endoscopists with sufficient EC experience. Second, in this experimental study, 5 pathologists were involved in histologic grading of inflammation using the Geboes score; however, interobserver consistency in the histologic grading was not evaluated, and a central inflammatory bowel disease\u2013specialized pathologist was not involved in the histologic scoring. Third, the outcome measures were not compared with the long-term clinical prognosis but instead with the onsite histologic activity. To compensate for these limitations, we are conducting a prospective study to compare long-term clinical prognoses with CAD diagnoses (UMIN000032476). In conclusion, we developed a CAD system that uses artificial intelligence and EC to provide fully automated diagnoses for the grading of UC-related mucosal inflammation. It has potential to allow support for immediate intervention and ultimately reduce the number of required biopsy samples.

However, identification of persistent histologic inflammation is extremely difficult using conventional endoscopy. Furthermore, the reproducibility of endoscopic disease activity is poor. We developed and evaluated a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to predict persistent histologic inflammation using endocytoscopy (EC; 520-fold ultra-magnifying endoscope). Methods We evaluated the accuracy of the CAD system using test image sets. First, we retrospectively reviewed the data of 187 patients with UC from whom biopsy samples were obtained after endocytoscopic observation. EC images and biopsy samples of each patient were collected from 6 colorectal segments: cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum. All EC images were tagged with reference to the biopsy sample\u2019s histologic activity. For validation samples, 525 validation sets of 525 independent segments were collected from 100 patients, and 12,900 EC images from the remaining 87 patients were used for machine learning to construct CAD. The primary outcome measure was the diagnostic ability of CAD to predict persistent histologic inflammation. Its reproducibility for all test images was also assessed. Results CAD provided diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy as follows: 74% (95% confidence interval, 65%-81%), 97% (95% confidence interval, 95%-99%), and 91% (95% confidence interval, 83%-95%), respectively. Its reproducibility was perfect (\u03ba = 1).
