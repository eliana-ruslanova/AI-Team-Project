We propose here a novel optimization method that uses different representations to explore the two search spaces: A binary representation for optimizing feature subsets and a continuous representation for evolving appropriate real-valued configurations of the spiking network. The properties and characteristics of the improved framework are studied on two different synthetic benchmark datasets. Results are compared to traditional methods, namely a multi-layer-perceptron and a na\u00efve Bayesian classifier (NBC). A previously used real world ecological dataset on invasive species establishment prediction is revisited and new results are obtained and analyzed by an ecological expert. The proposed method results in a much faster convergence to an optimal solution (or a close to it), in a better accuracy, and in a more informative set of features selected.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Evolving spiking neural network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Multiple probabilistic model"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Estimation of distribution algorithm"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608009001178", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608009001178", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "68149171764", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-68149171764", "pubmed-id": "19615855", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/68149171764", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20090702", "$": "2009-07-02"}}}}}
