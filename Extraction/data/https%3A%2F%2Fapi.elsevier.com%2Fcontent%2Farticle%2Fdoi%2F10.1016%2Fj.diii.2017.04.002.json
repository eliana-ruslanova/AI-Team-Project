Keywords Artificial intelligence Patient-centered medicine Longitudinal medical record Radiomics Precision medicine Radiology is one of the most innovative medical specialties, and remains very popular with our young colleagues \u2013 but is its future bright? To J.H. Thrall, three innovations seem likely to shape the future of medical imaging: advances in imaging techniques, evolutionary changes in medical informatics, and the development of precision medicine and imaging-based individualized therapy based on radiomics [1]. Radiomics is method of qualitative and quantitative analysis of digital medical imaging data that constitutes a new noninvasive biomarker concerning the genotype of a lesion or an individual [2,3]. These technological and conceptual breakthroughs suggest a growing role for Radiology, yet some commentators still express concern about the possible annihilation of our specialty [4,5]. The issue has created a buzz in the US and was debated at the most recent meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA). Why the controversy? Recent years have been marked by a rise in all areas of society of artificial intelligence (AI), a problem-solving approach involving the use of highly complex methods to replicate cognitive functions based on computer technologies and algorithmic techniques. A proponent of AI, based on advances in efficiency and computer-based diagnoses, might contend that radiologists are simply wasted protoplasm. Controversially, two recent articles predict the end of Radiology (and other specialties) within 5 to 10years [4,5]. K. Chockley and E. Emanuel assert that Radiology, despite some very enviable characteristics, is losing its attractiveness to American residents and must face three major threats in the US, all of them potentially fatal. The first threat is linked to the deinstitutionalization of care and the development of ambulatory and home-based medicine, which involves less biological investigation and imaging. The second threat is bundled payments and capitation for given pathologies, whatever the number of procedures performed, which generally leads to reductions in the use of radiological services for these pathologies. Last but not least, AI may soon do a better job than a radiologist. Machines can process masses of data extracted from an image, without tiring or being disturbed by external factors. They may also analyze data not perceptible to a radiologist and synthesize it, taking into account other available information, such as the patient's clinical and other history. Finally, they could establish a prognosis and propose a course of action. Is the threat real? Advances in automatic learning and AI are significant, with an impact on all aspects of society, not just video games and driverless cars. Many applications have already emerged in medicine [6]. For example, a team at Stanford University has recently demonstrated that an AI system is capable of classifying skin cancers with a level of competence identical to that of a qualified dermatologist [7]. In Radiology, the development of computer-assisted detection and diagnostic (CAD) systems is the first step in the process. The number of applications and precision are increasing gradually, allowing many diagnoses by AI, including the diagnosis of lung lesions on radiography or scanning, the detection of mammary, prostatic, and colonic lesions, the diagnosis of fractures on X-rays or of meniscal or cartilaginous lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), detection of cerebral hemorrhage on a CT scan, and quantification of blood flow [8\u201313]. Some of these systems are designed to provide assistance to radiologists, but others are already intended to replace them, particularly those who are either not experts or unavailable [14]. Watson, the AI program designed by IBM to understand, reason, and learn in all areas (medicine, finance, insurance, etc.), has already achieved some success since its victory playing the game Jeopardy in the USA in 2011. In a demonstration at the RSNA, the software was shown to be able to analyze a patient's clinical history, draw diagnostic hypotheses, analyze images, and even propose diagnoses, therapeutic options, and prognoses [15]. Lastly, the formation of gigantic databases that assemble patient information should make it possible to improve patient management, better define the subgroups in which they belong, better stratify their risks and, above all, provide the raw material for AI programs. Globally, several projects are emerging. In France, all data will soon be consolidated within the National Health Data System (Syst\u00e8me national des donn\u00e9es de sant\u00e9). As of April 2017, health insurance databases (Syst\u00e8me national d\u2019information interr\u00e9gimes de l\u2019Assurance Maladie) will co-ordinate with those of hospitals (Programme de M\u00e9dicalisation des Syst\u00e8mes d\u2019Information) and the billions of pieces of information concerning the health of the French will be accessible to any person or organization whether public or private, for profit or not [16]. However, these major developments are still not sufficient to justify the short-term replacement of radiologists by AI. According to a number of experts, including E. Siegel, there are many reasons for this [17]: \u2022 computer-aided diagnoses (CADs) are still little used by radiologists because they do not improve productivity and represent an additional cost; \u2022 the majority of AI systems remain focused on specific issues and do not yet cover most diagnostic needs of the medical field; \u2022 the role of radiologists is not limited to reading imaging examinations and diagnostic analysis; they are also involved in the communication of information, the organization of care, quality control, teaching and research, writing recommendations, and developing standards; \u2022 patient care sometimes requires radiologists to access several independent databases or to contact other practitioners directly. Allowing the AI to aggregate scattered or disparate information by overcoming or correcting the poor interoperability of different computer systems will take time. The new Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard, which is supposed to replace the current but obsolete HL7 standards, is still in its infancy [18]; \u2022 the validation by the Food and Drug Administration or the Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9 (HAS) of such systems, the modes of operation of which mean they essentially remain black boxes because of the confidentiality of algorithms and processes, will surely take many years; \u2022 the need for imaging and for radiologists is increasing all over the world because of the introduction of new technologies and increasing use of imaging technologies in the developing world, and we are far from seeing the reversal of this trend; \u2022 the development costs of these programs are very high and their profitability is uncertain; \u2022 finally, the legal, regulatory, and policy issues created by recent and future developments in the field of AI will need to be addressed before it can be introduced on the large scale. In perspective K. Chockley and E. Emanuel, in their article, underline the characteristics of our specialty that remain useful and the possible causes of decline [4]. Our main threat is not AI, although it will undoubtedly transform our practices, nor physicians from other specialties who have their eyes on our tools, or even those bodies (such as the National Union of Health Insurance Funds in France) that impose tariff cuts on every increase in productivity. Our main enemy is ourselves: the actual service rendered has no proper evaluation standards, patient-centered medicine is of insufficient concern, and the added value of the radiology report is not always a priority [19\u201322]. In fact, there are numerous ways to provide higher value in health care and radiology services. Improving the value of the radiology report is obviously a good strategy. For instance, contact with patients, traditionally tenuous in our specialty but that patients have expressed a desire for, is sometimes the most effective way to understand their pathology and their specific needs. By creating or improving this contact, the essential role of radiologists in the management of patients will come to the fore [23\u201326]. Overall, in a vast field of possibilities, our future probably remains bright if we become more patient-interaction oriented. We must take into account ongoing developments in AI and productivity gains, which will have to be converted into qualitative improvement and direct service to the patient [27]. Undoubtedly, the initiatives of radiological societies will help us to raise awareness amongst our colleagues and promote the new roles for radiologists in patient management.
