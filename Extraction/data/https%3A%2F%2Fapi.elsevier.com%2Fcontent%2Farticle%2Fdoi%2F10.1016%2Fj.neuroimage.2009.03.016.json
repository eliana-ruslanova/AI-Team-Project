On the contrary, exploratory methods, like the support vector machine (SVM), are independent of prior hemodynamic response function (HRF), but generally lack a statistical inference framework. To take the advantages of both kinds of methods, this paper presents a composite approach through combining conventional GLM with SVM. This hybrid SVM\u2013GLM concept is to use the power of SVM to obtain a data-derived reference function and enter it into the conventional GLM for statistical inference. The data-derived reference function was extracted from the SVM classifier using a new temporal profile extraction method. In simulations with synthetic fMRI data, SVM\u2013GLM demonstrated a better sensitivity and specificity performance for detecting the synthetic activations, as compared to the conventional GLM. With real fMRI data, SVM\u2013GLM showed better sensitivity than regular GLM for detecting the sensorimotor activations.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Support vector machine"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "General linear model"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "fMRI"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Temporal fluctuations"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Random effect analysis"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1053811909002675", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811909002675", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "64949183329", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-64949183329", "pubmed-id": "19303449", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/64949183329", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20090319", "$": "2009-03-19"}}}}}
