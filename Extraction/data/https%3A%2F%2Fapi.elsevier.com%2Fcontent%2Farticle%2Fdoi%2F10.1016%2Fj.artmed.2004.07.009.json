The IDAN/KNAVE-II combination significantly increased the accuracy and speed of answering complex queries about both the data and their abstractions, compared to the standard tools.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion:\n                  The implemented architecture proves the feasibility of the distributed integration of medical knowledge sources with clinical data of heterogeneous sources. The results suggest that the proposed IDAN modular architecture has potential significance for supporting the automation of clinical tasks such as diagnosis, monitoring, therapy, and quality assessment.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Temporal reasoning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Temporal abstraction"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Knowledge-based systems"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Mediators"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Clinical systems"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Medical informatics"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0933365704001228", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365704001228", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "18844409115", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-18844409115", "pubmed-id": "15885563", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/18844409115", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20050105", "$": "2005-01-05"}}}}}
