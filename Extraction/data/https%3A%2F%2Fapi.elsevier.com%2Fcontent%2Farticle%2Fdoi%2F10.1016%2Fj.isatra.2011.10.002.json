Till now, in the literature, to analyze the fuzzy system reliability, it is assumed that the failure rates of all components of a system follow the same type of fuzzy set or intuitionistic fuzzy set. However, in practical problems, such type of situation rarely occurs. Therefore, in the present paper, a new algorithm has been introduced to construct the membership function and non-membership function of fuzzy reliability of a system having components following different types of intuitionistic fuzzy failure rates. Functions of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are calculated to construct the membership function and non-membership function of fuzzy reliability via non-linear programming techniques. Using the proposed algorithm, membership functions and non-membership functions of fuzzy reliability of a series system and a parallel systems are constructed. Our study generalizes the various works of the literature. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the proposed algorithm.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Fuzzy system reliability"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Intuitionistic fuzzy number"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Functions of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019057811001170", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019057811001170", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84857046337", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84857046337", "pubmed-id": "22134065", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84857046337", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20111130", "$": "2011-11-30"}}}}}
