The off-line observer/Kalman filter identification (OKID) method is used to obtain the decentralized linear models for subsystems in the interconnected large-scale system. In order to get over the effect of modeling error on the identified linear model of each subsystem, an improved observer with the high-gain property based on the digital redesign approach is developed to replace the observer identified by OKID. Then, the iterative learning control (ILC) scheme is integrated with the high-gain tracker design for the decentralized models. To significantly reduce the iterative learning epochs, a digital-redesign linear quadratic digital tracker with the high-gain property is proposed as the initial control input of ILC. The high-gain property controllers can suppress uncertain errors such as modeling errors, nonlinear perturbations, and external disturbances (Guo et\u00a0al., 2000) [18]. Thus, the system output can quickly and accurately track the desired reference in one short time interval after all drastically-changing points of the specified reference input with the closed-loop decoupling property.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Decentralized control"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Digital redesign"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Linear quadratic tracker"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Iterative learning control"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S001905781100084X", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001905781100084X", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "83555165977", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-83555165977", "pubmed-id": "21872855", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/83555165977", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20110827", "$": "2011-08-27"}}}}}
