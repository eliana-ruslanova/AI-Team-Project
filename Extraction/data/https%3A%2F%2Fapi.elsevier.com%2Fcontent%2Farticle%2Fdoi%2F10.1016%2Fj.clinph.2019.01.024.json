The data were converted to Mel-spectrogram. Data augmentation was then applied to the training data. Deep learning algorithms were applied to assess the accuracies of correct classification, with or without the use of pre-trained weights for deep-learning networks.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  While the original data yielded the accuracy up to 0.86 on the test dataset, data-augmentation up to 200,000 training images showed significant increase in the accuracy to 1.0.
