The inlet concentrations of H, M, P, unit flow and operation time were used as the model inputs, while the outputs were the RE of H, M and P, respectively. After testing and validating the results, an optimal network topology of 5-8-3 was obtained. The model predictions were analyzed using Casual index (CI) values. M removal in the BTF was influenced positively by the inlet concentration of M in mixture (CI=3.79), while the removal of P and H were influenced more by the time of BTF operation (CI=25.36, 15.62). The BTF was subjected to different types of short-term shock-loads: 5-h shock-load of HMP mixture simultaneously, and 2.5-h shock-load of either H, M, or P, individually. It was observed that, short-term shock-loads of individual pollutants (M or H) did not significantly affect their own removal, but the removal of P was affected by 50%. The results from this study also show the sensitiveness of the well-acclimated BTF to handle sudden load variations and also revival capability of the BTF when pre-shock conditions were restored.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Biotrickling filter"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Neural modeling"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Casual index"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Interaction effects"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Shock-loads"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304389413008625", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389413008625", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84896544031", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84896544031", "pubmed-id": "24315813", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84896544031", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20131118", "$": "2013-11-18"}}}}}
