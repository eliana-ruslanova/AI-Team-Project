Both parts are executed at each sampling instant. The predictive control part of the first algorithm is the Nonlinear Model Predictive Control strategy and the control part of the second algorithm is the Generalized Predictive Control strategy. In the identification parts of both algorithms the process model is approximated by a series\u2013parallel neural network structure which is trained by a recursive least squares (ARLS) method. The two control algorithms have been applied to: 1) the temperature control of a fluidized bed furnace reactor (FBFR) of a pilot plant and 2) the auto-pilot control of an F-16 aircraft. The training and validation data of the neural network are obtained from the open-loop simulation of the FBFR and the nonlinear F-16 aircraft models. The identification and control simulation results show that the first algorithm outperforms the second one at the expense of extra computation time.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Adaptive recursive least squares"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Generalized predictive control"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Identification"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Neural networks"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Nonlinear adaptive model predictive control"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019057810001308", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019057810001308", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "79952454328", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-79952454328", "pubmed-id": "21281932", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79952454328", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20110201", "$": "2011-02-01"}}}}}
