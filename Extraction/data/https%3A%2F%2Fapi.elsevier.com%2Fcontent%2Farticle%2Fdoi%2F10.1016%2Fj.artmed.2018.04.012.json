Abstract Background Clinical decision-support systems (CDSS) are designed to solve knowledge-intensive tasks for supporting decision-making processes. Although many approaches for designing CDSS have been proposed, due to high implementation costs, as well as the lack of interoperability features, current solutions are not well-established across different institutions. Recently, the use of standardized formalisms for knowledge representation as terminologies as well as the integration of semantically enriched clinical information models, as openEHR Archetypes, and their reuse within CDSS are theoretically considered as key factors for reusable CDSS. Objective We aim at developing and evaluating an openEHR based approach to achieve interoperability in CDSS by designing and implementing an exemplary system for automated systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) detection in pediatric intensive care. Methods We designed an interoperable concept, which enables an easy integration of the CDSS across different institutions, by using openEHR Archetypes, terminology bindings and the Archetype Query Language (AQL). The practicability of the approach was tested by (1) implementing a prototype, which is based on an openEHR based data repository of the Hannover Medical School (HaMSTR), and (2) conducting a first pilot study. Results We successfully designed and implemented a CDSS with interoperable knowledge bases and interfaces by reusing internationally agreed-upon Archetypes, incorporating LOINC terminology and creating AQL queries, which allowed retrieving dynamic facts in a standardized and unambiguous form. The technical capabilities of the system were evaluated by testing the prototype on 16 randomly selected patients with 129 days of stay, and comparing the results with the assessment of clinical experts (leading to a sensitivity of 1.00, a specificity of 0.94 and a Cohen\u2019s kappa of 0.92). Conclusions We found the use of openEHR Archetypes and AQL a feasible approach to bridge the interoperability gap between local infrastructures and CDSS. The designed concept was successfully transferred into a clinically evaluated openEHR based CDSS. To the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first openEHR based CDSS, which is technically reliable and capable in a real context, and facilitates clinical decision-support for a complex task. Further activities will comprise enrichments of the knowledge base, the reasoning processes and cross-institutional evaluations. Keywords Clinical decision support systems Pediatrics Health information interoperability openEHR Archetypes Clinical data repository Systemic inflammatory response syndrome 1 Introduction 1.1 Knowledge-based systems for clinical decision-support Medical practice is characterized by a wide variety of different, complex decision-making problems that have to be solved by medical staff continuously throughout their clinical routine (\u201cmedical practice is medical decision-making\u201d [1]). The quality of decision-making highly depends on the availability of a broad knowledge-base, which comprises domain, explicit, factual and tacit knowledge. A medical expert is able to handle the complexity of these knowledge-intensive tasks. However, clinical routine includes a high pressure of time, a high amount of parallel tasks and many interruptions. This can lead to healthcare decisions with a lower quality than aspired [2,3]. Besides, the implicit knowledge of an expert is personally bound and not accessible permanently [3]. Clinical Decision-Support Systems (CDSS) are described as \u201c(\u2026) any computer program designed to help healthcare professionals to make clinical decisions\u201d [1]. They are often referred to as a key element to enhance patient safety and quality of care [4,5]. By processing, analyzing, summarizing and representing crucial information, medical staff can be supported. This can lead to better informed healthcare decisions [3]. CDSS can be designed as knowledge-based systems, which represent the expertise, knowledge and inference procedures a human expert applies while dealing with knowledge-intensive decision tasks [1,6]. Knowledge-based systems are characterized by a functional decomposition of a knowledge base and an inference engine, and can be used in different contexts as diagnosis, prognosis, configuration or monitoring [6\u20138]. Currently, knowledge-based CDSS are mainly used to support diagnosis, medication tasks, mechanical ventilation or monitoring processes in intensive care settings [9]. However, although there are many other use cases for CDSS, these systems are often not extensively adopted in clinical routine or shareable across institutions. 1.2 Semantic interoperability in CDSS The lack of CDSS adoption might be due to different factors, e.g., legal, ethical and financial challenges, the inadequate integration in the clinician\u2019s workflow [7] or insufficient quality of data, domain and inference knowledge [10]. Apart from these, a very well-known bottleneck is the challenge of providing easy integration with local systems (e.g., hospital information systems) [7]. Often, CDSS are designed as stand-alone systems without interfaces to electronic health records. Hence, redundant data acquisition is needed, which might hinder routine use of CDSS [7]. As one of the best known approaches, addressing this issue in the context of clinical knowledge representation, the Arden Syntax allows the alignment with local data repositories in specific sections of the Medical Logic Modules (MLM) (called data sections). By using curly braces [\u201c{}\u201d], site-specific mapping clauses to local environments are defined in sections, which are separated from the logic rules. Here, it is often referred to the \u2018curly braces problem\u2019 because each reuse of MLMs requires an adaption of local mappings [11\u201314]. Although different approaches for the evaluation of mappings exist (e.g., within Arden2ByteCode compiler [14]), CDSS based on MLMs are not extensively shared. Furthermore, by providing this \u2018implementation defined\u2019 gap, it cannot be semantically assured that the data is representing the data set, which is required for the reasoning task (e.g., because different meanings of clinical concepts exist). If the semantic of the data elements, which are processed in knowledge-based systems, is not defined, the inference procedure might lead to weak results. Hence, the use of standardized formalisms to represent logic and knowledge is a key factor for interoperability of CDSS. A semantic enrichment of data elements provided to the inference engine of a CDSS is to assure that there is a common, shared meaning of data (semantic interoperability). Within the context of EHR systems, Martinez-Costa et al. [15] distinguish the aforementioned levels of semantic interoperability in models of use (generic information and clinical models) and models of meanings (ontologies and terminologies). These insights are also acknowledged more frequently in recent work on semantic interoperability in CDSS. The focus is shifted towards the use of clinical information standards as HL7 V3 RIM, openEHR, HL7 CDA/CCR, HL7 VMR or Intermountain CEMs in combination with guideline representation formalisms, ontologies and terminologies [16]. In the context of openEHR, most recently Marcos et al. [17] described a concept on linking CDSS to heterogeneous EHRs by using openEHR Archetypes. A prototypical CDSS implementation for supporting the patient recruitment in clinical trials for colorectal cancer screenings was evaluated on simulated data sets. Another approach, which focuses on the integration between openEHR Archetypes and non-knowledge based systems, was presented by Marco-Ruiz et al. [18]. Here, the presented meta-architecture was not tested practically because neither a prototype was implemented nor an evaluation in a realistic clinical scenario was carried out. Hence, to the best of our knowledge, recent approaches have not presented openEHR based CDSS to the extent as we do: (1) with the design of a prototype, which works on real data sets originating from patient data management systems, (2) by selecting an exemplary use case of high importance for pediatric intensive care and (3) by conducting a first pilot study for evaluating the technical practicability of the approach. 1.3 Use case In this work, we aim at investigating an openEHR based approach to achieve semantic interoperability in CDSS. The practicability of the described approach is examined by designing, implementing and assessing a system for a knowledge-intensive task as pediatric SIRS detection in pediatric intensive care. SIRS was first introduced in adults to describe a nonspecific systemic inflammatory process in the absence of infection [19]. In case of positive blood culture or suspected infection with response to antibiotic treatment, SIRS becomes sepsis. For the pediatric population, SIRS criteria for adults were incorporated and modified with age-specific norms for children by the IPSCC [20]. SIRS in children is manifested by the presence of at least two out of four criteria, one of which must be an abnormal temperature or leukocyte count: a) hyperthermia or hypothermia, b) tachycardia c) tachy- or bradypnoea or d) leukocytosis or leukopenia [20] (see Tables A1 and A2 in Appendix A). The problem for the pediatrician in charge lays in the complexity of the definition, with differentiation in six age groups and the resulting widespread age-specific normal values for heart rate, respiratory rate and leukocyte counts. Some very young patients (newborn babies) even change twice the underlying age group whilst being on the PICU. Patient data management software is able to visualize all data on screen but often there is a certain time delay between the fulfilling of the different types of criteria for SIRS and sepsis (e.g., laboratory values, vital signs, automated transferred data, annotations of the nursing staff). The resulting complexity of the diagnostic process makes it very difficult for the clinician to recognize SIRS or sepsis early in the clinical routine. But SIRS and sepsis have a relevant impact on the clinical outcome of pediatric ICU patients [21,22]. Especially in the septic patient, different studies proved that any delay in the treatment directly leads to an increase in morbidity and mortality [23]. Moreover, the occurrence of SIRS predispose patients to organ failure and frequently determines the clinical outcomes [19]. Mortality and morbidity of severe non-infectious SIRS did not differ from severe sepsis, as shown in a multicenter trial in 3500 patients in adult intensive care units [24]. SIRS on admission determined mortality and length of stay of critically ill adult trauma patients [25]. Pathophysiological mechanisms of SIRS and sepsis are similar but the management of SIRS is typically non-specific [26]. However, an early detection of SIRS and sepsis may help to prevent organ dysfunction or organ failure, and contribute to a better outcome of intensive care patients. 1.4 Objectives 1 Both, the design of interoperable CDSS and the development of CDSS in pediatric SIRS-settings are still active fields of research. With our work, we investigate an openEHR based approach to achieve semantic interoperability in CDSS by using Archetypes and AQL. The goal is to evaluate the technical practicability of this approach, to gain first insights on the feasibility and to identify possible bottlenecks. 2 In matters of the selected use case, the detection of SIRS and sepsis in pediatric intensive care settings is a time-consuming, complex and knowledge-intensive task because of the wide variety of disease patterns, age-specific characteristics and personal experiences of clinical staff as well as implicit knowledge assets, which need to be considered. We aim at designing a system, which is capable of providing relevant information to clinical staff at the right time. This possibly can help to identify courses of disease at an early stage. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Knowledge acquisition, representation and reasoning The conceptual design of our CDSS was based on the CommonKADS methodology for developing knowledge-based systems [27]. CommonKADS is an abstract modelling method for knowledge acquisition and knowledge base creation, which follows the principles of model-based knowledge engineering. While developing the CDSS, we constructed different models, whereas each model represented different aspects of the desired system, its relevance and/or its context. Within the contextual analysis, we dealt with the environment embedding the system (organizational model), the selected knowledge-intensive task (task model) and the actors and systems involved (agent model). The conceptual analysis aims at analyzing knowledge assets and constructing knowledge models, which represent assets and inference processes. We used these models for the design of a CDSS prototype [27,28]. The acquisition and representation of domain knowledge and inference procedures, which are needed for recognizing SIRS, required a close consultation with medical experts and a deep understanding of published guidelines. Therefore, we cooperated closely with medical staff from the department of Pediatric Cardiology and Intensive Care Medicine. By discussing SIRS literature and research work, interviewing medical experts and watching the routines in the ward, the key knowledge assets were identified. Based on these analysis results, a use case-specific knowledge model was constructed. For knowledge representation, we decided to choose rules as format. Choosing rules facilitated the involvement of the medical experts, while forming a knowledge base, because the main criteria that define SIRS are already documented in a rule-like format (see Table A1 in Appendix A). Furthermore, rules are comprehensive, consist of a flexible format and are supported by well-known Business Rule Management Systems (BRMS). 2.2 openEHR Clinical modelling deals with the challenge of representing information originating from medical documentation, for utilizing these, e.g., in analyses or CDSS. To avoid misassumptions and misinterpretations while processing data retrieved from heterogeneous data sources, a high level of consistency, standardization and exchangeability of information models is required. A recent approach to meet these needs is called clinical information modelling (CIM) [29]. Different initiatives are following this idea, including HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) [30], ISO/CEN EN13606 [31], HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) [32], Intermountain Healthcare Clinical Elements [33], and openEHR [34]. The principles of the openEHR based modelling approach and architecture are described within the openEHR specification [34]. As other CIM approaches, openEHR is based on the idea of a two level modelling methodology, separating technical from domain-specific contents. This separation is realized through the use of a reference model, which specifies data types, data structures, and an Archetype model. The latter consists of specifications of Archetypes and Templates, which are used for modelling. The modelling is carried out by using the Archetype Definition Language (ADL) [35] to define constraints on the element of the reference model. The two level approach enables the exchange and reuse of Archetypes within any system implementing the reference model. Archetypes represent clinical concepts by defining items, which together describe not only a restricted, but a maximum, set of possible characteristics of the concepts. Forming a maximum set should allow for an increased reuse of the same Archetype in any use case, in which this clinical concept might be relevant [36,37]. Templates can be used to adapt Archetypes to a specific context by either restricting the Archetype (e.g., by modifying its attributes and occurrences), or combining different Archetypes (often used to represent complex medical documents) [37]. Furthermore, openEHR allows the binding of external terminologies to specific elements of an Archetype [37]. In this work, the use of openEHR Archetypes and Templates, which represent the clinical concepts for SIRS detection in pediatric intensive care settings, is a key factor to achieve interoperability in CDSS. To facilitate the reusability of the CDSS, we pursued the reuse of existing Archetypes, which are provided in the global openEHR Clinical Knowledge Manager (CKM) [38]. The CKM is a web-based tool for collaborative development, evaluation and exchange of Archetypes. All Archetypes undergo an iterative review process, by involving many clinical and technical experts until, they are marked as published. Through this process, the Archetypes become a high quality maximum data set representation of the underlying clinical concept, leading to a high reusability rate. 2.2.1 openEHR based data repository (HaMSTR) We transferred the conceptual design into a prototypical implementation, which is based on an openEHR based data repository called HaMSTR (Hannover Medical School Translational Research Framework). Besides the data repository, which is based on the Think!EHR platform of Marand, 1 1 http://www.marand-think.com/ HaMSTR consists of ETL tools enabling the use of Archetypes and Templates for data integration tasks (Microsoft SQL Server Integration Servers, Altova Mapforce 2014 and self-developed workflow and mapping tools) [39]. HaMSTR was established as part of research activities on the use of semantic interoperability standards for secondary use of data at the Peter L. Reichertz Institute for Medical Informatics. It already could be successfully used for other projects as the automated population of an i2b2 clinical data warehouse from an openEHR based data repository [39] or the automated transformation of openEHR data instances to Web Ontology Language (OWL) [40]. HaMSTR stores data from different local systems and records, e.g., the electronic medical record (i.s.h. med), the laboratory information system (OPUS-L) and patient data management systems (m.life and the legacy system COPRA). For using HaMSTR in the context of this work, we integrated the data sets, which were needed for SIRS detection (see Section 3.3). 2.2.2 Archetype Query Language (AQL) To create a conceptual design for an interoperable CDSS for recognizing SIRS, we decided to access data from HaMSTR via Archetype Query Language (AQL). In contrast to other available query languages as SQL, XQuery or SPARQL, querying with AQL does not require previous knowledge on the physical implementation of the persistence layer. AQL is used to formulate queries directly on the Archetype, respectively semantic level, thus enabling to share queries with other institutions as long as the same Archetypes are in use [41]. In our use case, AQL was used to retrieve demographic data, vital signs and laboratory values (per patient, per day). The returned result sets were then inserted as dynamic working facts in the knowledge base of our system (see Section 3.3.4). 2.3 Evaluation To evaluate the system\u2019s feasibility of identifying pediatric SIRS, a proof-of-concept study was conducted. Before, verification tests, to check whether the static part of the knowledge base (e.g., the logical configuration of domain-specific concepts or rules) is syntactically correct, consistent and complete, were conducted. The syntactic correctness was tested automatically while parsing (automatic syntax checks). The consistency was assessed manually through an examination of the Drools rules and their firing. An example of a logical consistence is that only one parameter value can be related to exactly one alarm state. A parameter value is part of one patient state, which means that only one of them can be related to exactly one alarm state as well. Another example is that the firing of a SIRS event rule (per patient, per day) cannot occur simultaneously with that of a No SIRS event rule. Furthermore, to assure that the dynamic facts can be inserted in the knowledge base smoothly, the interface between the CDSS and the openEHR based data repository, as well as the performance of the AQL queries, were assessed. Therefore, a test data set for each dynamic fact was sent from the openEHR based data repository to the CDSS. Furthermore, a test data set containing compositions of the SIRS Assessment Report was sent from the CDSS back to the repository. The pilot study included the retrospective assessment of 16 pediatric intensive care patients with different demographic characteristics, diagnoses, courses of disease and lengths of stay. Expected SIRS prevalence in the PICU was 5\u201310% and incidence was 20\u201330% (data from a randomized trial with 807 PICU patients from this ward [21]). Patients were randomly selected. The goals of this study were to evaluate the technical practicability of our approach, gain first insights on the feasibility of the designed concept and identify possible bottlenecks. Firstly, the CDSS assessed whether patients suffered from SIRS during their stay. Secondly, two experienced pediatric intensive care physicians, without knowledge of the results of the CDSS analysis, assessed the same patients according to the SIRS rules defined in [20]. In cases of disagreement, the physicians discussed the case in detail to find a consensus on how to assess the case according to the SIRS rules. It is assumed that medical experts, who use these rules, will correctly determine SIRS events (gold standard). As presented in Section 1.3, in pediatric settings, these rules are not as simple as assumed because they leave wide scope for interpretation in real clinical settings. Hence, an evaluation with medical experts was needed to assess the accuracy of the CDSS knowledge base in real settings (by determining sensitivity and specificity). As another measure, Cohen\u2019s kappa was calculated to rate the inter-assessor reliability between the experts and the CDSS. 3 Results 3.1 Contextual analysis Before the conceptual design, we explored whether such SIRS system would be useful at all. A detailed analysis of the processes at a selected intensive care ward was carried out, and revealed that clinicians are in fact faced with challenging work conditions, including time pressure, stress and risky situations (as acknowledged in the literature [2,42]). Furthermore, in the literature, it is well-known that clinicians mostly apply their own expertise and experience to make decisions. They often complement their decision process by using the best available evidence [43]. However, in pediatric intensive care, the evidence level is low because randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are scarce and difficult to conduct [44]. Within our analysis in the ward, knowledge about patients or diseases such as SIRSs was not documented or transparent. We concluded that clinicians mostly use their own expertise for SIRS detection (knowledge-intensive task). Additionally, our process analysis revealed that the current SIRS detection is very time-intensive, does not take place continuously (e.g., only before handovers, which might be too late) and without any advanced computerized decision-support beyond standardized monitoring. The contextual analysis supported us in our assumption that a CDSS for SIRS detection have the potential to enable faster, more trusted and high-quality detection of SIRS. This might lead to an earlier treatment and result in an overall improvement of the patients\u2019 outcome. 3.2 Conceptual analysis We constructed a use case-specific knowledge model before implementing the CDSS. Firstly, key knowledge categories, which are incorporated by the clinicians while detecting SIRS \u2013 SIRS specific knowledge, pediatric domain knowledge, patient knowledge and process knowledge \u2013, were identified in close cooperation with medical experts (co-author TJ and colleagues). On the basis of these categories, the domain, inference and task models were constructed, which resulted in an overall knowledge model. The task model is a high-level view on the capabilities of the system. In our use case, the general task is SIRS detection. The task was decomposed to the subtasks monitoring (see step 1\u20134) and assessment (see step 5\u20137). To perform each of these tasks and reach the overall goal of accurate SIRS detection, different inference functions had to be implemented and executed in a logical order. Therefore, an inference model, which defines the temporal relations and inferences between tasks, was designed. The inference model can be explained briefly as follows. The system should be capable of (1) obtaining data sets from external systems, (2) inserting data as dynamic facts into the knowledge base, (3) specifying a norm value for each fact by using a static model, which represents SIRS parameters and rules, (4) classifying patient states as alarm states as soon as certain parameters deviate from the norm values, (5) selecting a SIRS criteria (e.g., \u2018two parameter alarms are active simultaneously\u2019 or \u2018temperature or leukocyte alarm is active\u2019), (6) evaluating if the criterion is met, and (7) matching the SIRS criteria to make SIRS decisions (e.g., the co-occurrence of \u2018two parameter alarms are active simultaneously\u2019 as true and \u2018temperature or leukocyte alarm is active\u2019 as false will result in No SIRS). The domain-specific concepts as patient, parameter, patient state, alarm were defined in detail within the domain model. Furthermore, rule types taking on the static roles within the knowledge base (e.g., the parameter norm model for the inference of age-specific norm values), and their relation to the domain concepts, were specified. For example, we defined the order of value checks and rule firings in a detailed process (called inference model, see above). Furthermore, after knowledge acquisition, it appeared vital to enhance and refine the high-level SIRS rules of [20] (see Table A1 in Appendix A) because they do not contain all information needed (as the temporal relations between different parameter alarms). The detailed description of the inference and domain models, as well as the documentation of the final knowledge base, including the final SIRS criteria, concepts and rules, are beyond of the scope of this paper and will be published separately. However, the general structure and exemplary rules are presented in the description of the prototype (see Section 3.3.4). 3.3 Design A prototypical implementation of the concept was implemented by using the openEHR based data repository HaMSTR as data source (based on the Think!EHR platform of Marand) (see Fig. 1 ). Java 8 and Eclipse Java EE (Version Mars 4.5) were used as programming language and integrated development environment. For designing a graphical user interface, JavaFX and JavaFX SceneBuilder were used. The reasoning results were stored on the Think!EHR platform by using an openEHR Template (SIRS Assessment Report), which was designed specifically for this purpose. For knowledge base creation, reasoning and processing of time-related events two modules of the Open Source Business Rule Management System (BRMS) Drools 2 2 http://www.drools.org/ (by JBoss (RedHat)), Drools Expert (rule engine) and Drools Fusion, were used. Within our work, the processing of continuously incoming data streams (e.g., intensive care vital values measured continuously), and the integration of time-based functions directly within the rules (e.g., sliding windows), were crucial. This supported us in our decision to use Drools instead of openEHR Guideline Definition Language (GDL) [45]. However, the use of GDL can be further discussed (as outlined in Section 5.1). 3.3.1 Archetypes and data integration When implementing a system based on an openEHR based data repository, it has to be ensured that all Archetypes, which are relevant for the use case, are available and the data sets are accessible through these Archetypes. For our work, we used the Archetypes listed in Table 1 . We decided to use Archetypes, which are published in the international CKM (repository of the openEHR Foundation). Because no Archetype that represents mechanical ventilation was available, we modelled new Ventilator Archetypes in cooperation with medical experts from the intensive care unit of the Hannover Medical School (co-author TJ and colleagues). We put them together with existing Archetypes into a Template called AssistedVentilation (see Fig. B1 in Appendix B). Furthermore, to store the reasoned results on the openEHR based data repository, we designed a new Template (SIRS Assessment Report) (see Fig. 2 ). In our previous work, we tested the Archetype modelling and the integration of legacy data into our openEHR based data repository (see [46]). We further enriched the data repository by integrating data sets for the SIRS use case. Therefore, we followed a similar approach as described in [46]. We optimized the processes of data integration and Archetype mapping by the development of generic workflow and supporting tools for transforming data from its relational representation into a Template based representation. 3.3.2 Data connection, retrieval via AQL and storage We established a connection to the Think!EHR server and the Template, form, service, composition and query service. For accessing the data sets through Archetypes, AQL queries were built (see Fig. 3 ). The query represents a request of all neutrophil values for a specific patient at a specific day. By using the EHR ID in the from-clause, the patient can be identified because the external patient ID is bound to the EHR ID. Within our prototype, a patient is selected by name because this is the most convenient way for clinicians to identify their patients intuitively within their clinical routine. To avoid misinterpretations, in case of redundant patient names, a warning message is printed and the correct patient ID can be selected. In any case, the use of external system identifiers or names implies that a query for executing the mapping between identifier and EHR ID has to be carried out. The parameter is specified within the CONTAINS-clause by accessing an Archetype (here lab test). The result set is restricted to a specific day within the WHERE-clause. For processing the incoming data within Drools, the result set has to be ordered by increasing timestamp. The storing of the results was implemented by using the SIRS Assessment Report Template as Operational Template (.odt) and the REST API of Think!EHR. For each result, a new composition of the template was created and stored on the platform. For any SIRS case, an instance of the Problem/Diagnosis Archetype was created. The fulfilled SIRS criteria (e.g., temperature alarm) were stored as instances of the nested Symptom/Sign Archetype. 3.3.3 Terminology binding Within openEHR Archetypes, it is possible to bind elements to external terminologies. The use of external terminologies in Archetypes is twofold. They can be used to restrict the use of Archetype elements by definition, or they can be used to semantically enrich the data set within the data integration process [37]. None of the Archetypes required for our use case contains restricted elements, so we were able to integrate the legacy data into HaMSTR without considering terminologies. However, we decided to enrich the laboratory data with LOINC codes afterwards. Any instance of the \u2018laboratory test\u2019-Archetype contains an element of type DV_CODED_TEXT, which is linked to both, the terminology ID (e.g., \u2018LOINC\u2019) and the actual code (e.g., \u2018770-8\u2019). Adding LOINC codes allows standardized retrieval of data sets. For accessing laboratory values we specified the AQL result set by pointing to specific LOINC codes in the where-clause (/name/defining_code/code_string\u202f=\u202f'770-8', see Fig. 3). Within the use case of this work, we used the LOINC codes LNC:6690-2 for leukocytes in blood by automated count and LNC:770-8 for neutrophils/100 leukocytes in blood by automated count. By using terminologies as LOINC codes within the Archetype and the AQL query, we support that the data set, which were retrieved, exactly represents the data set required for the reasoning task. Then, every institution using LOINC codes can use the AQL correctly, and can be confident that it will provide exactly the values and formats needed. 3.3.4 Knowledge bases, reasoning processes and user interface When using Drools, knowledge bases can be established by implementing Drools KieSessions. KieSessions were used as interfaces between the application and the rule engine for enabling the triggering of rules, which were generated in the knowledge base. Within our work, we decided to use both, decision tables and Drools rule files, for representing rules. This leaded to a definition of two sessions (kSessionDtables, kSessionRules). The knowledge base of kSessionDtables consists of different decision tables, including one that represents the rules of the parameter norm model. This model was used to infer the valid age-specific minimum and maximum values for each vital sign or laboratory parameter. Then, these were assigned to the patient state, which were obtained from the openEHR based data repository (see Fig. 4 ). Afterwards, the data set was enriched with the norm values, which leaded to a firing of the rules, which are stored in the alarm model decision tables. Here, it was inferred whether an alarm should be set for the given patient state (e.g., because of exceeding the norm value). To do so, the calculation of a reference value was needed. Therefore, the patient state-fact was inserted into the second session kSessionRule. Here, rules that calculate the median values of the last hour (for vital signs) or the last measured value (for laboratory values) were fired. After the alarms were set for the patient states, it was checked whether a crucial combination of alarms was active simultaneously. Therefore, temporal rules for active alarms are stored within kSessionRules. This knowledge base is decomposed in two sets, each representing another possible combination of alarm events, which lead to a SIRS alarm. One covers any co-occurrence of a heart rate or respiratory rate alarm together with a leukocytes, neutrophils or temperature alarm. Another represents the combination of a temperature with a leukocyte/neutrophils alarm (see Fig. 5 ). Because every possible temporal relation meaning \u2018co-occurrence\u2019 had to be considered during knowledge base creation, every set consists of multiple similar rules (up to ten), which differ only in their temporal operators (including coincides, overlaps/overlapped by, starts/started by, finishes/finishes by, includes/during). However, due to potential delayed documentation of laboratory values, a combination of an alarm event and a leukocyte/neutrophil alarm event occurring not at the same time, but up to six hours later, was incorporated as SIRS as well (temporal operator after). The prototypical implementation was completed by designing a graphical user interface (see Fig. C1 in Appendix C). The interface serves as dialogue component by allowing the user to pick a specific patient and day. In addition, it can be used as explanation facility, which reveals the reasoning process of the system to the user (e.g., by visualizing parameter values or violation of age-specific norm values, by highlighting SIRS phases or by explaining SIRS type and length). 4 Evaluation To evaluate the capabilities of the system, a pilot study with 16 pediatric intensive care patients was conducted. Overall, 129 days of stay were included. We were able to integrate data from all included patients into the openEHR based data repository. For the selected patients, 563.629 data sets (108.313 for temperature, 799 for leukocytes, 89 for neutrophils, 227.644 for heart rate, 224.194 for respiratory rate, 2.590 for controlled mechanical ventilation) were available in the openEHR based data repository. The data sets were inserted in the knowledge base of the CDSS as dynamic facts, which then were processed by the reasoning engine. The execution time per patient per day took about 30\u202fs \u2013 45\u202fs. The CDSS identified 42 days with and 87 days without SIRS events. In comparison, the medical experts identified 36 days with and 93 days without SIRS events. The system correctly identified all 36 SIRS days and was mistaken in 6 cases. When using the results of the expert per day as reference, this leads to a specificity of 0.94 and a sensitivity of 1.00. The Cohen\u2019s kappa as a measure for interrater reliability can be reported as 0.92. It is worth mentioning that there were more than six cases, in which the system results deviates from the experts\u2019 ones. There were cases (e. g. Patient I day 12, Patient II SIRS day 1\u20133, Patient VII day 4, Patient IX day 8\u20139, Patient XII day 1,4,6), in which the experts decided to revise their decisions. In some of these cases, the medical experts did not identify SIRS events because the neutrophil measurements of the patients were not directly visible on the patient data management system. In other cases, as in patient VII, the experts specified other norm values for the age-group. Thereby, the values of the leukocyte measurements were not recognized as exceedance of the norm values. Furthermore, e. g. in patient XII, the medical experts did not notice that the labor measurements went below the norm values. After short discussions, the medical experts revised their decision in favor of the CDSS results, and declared all of these cases as SIRS. On the basis of the revised decisions, the aforementioned results could be reached. The six wrong cases were caused by different aspects. As example, in the last day of patient VIII, all formal SIRS criteria were met. However, the experts did not decide on a SIRS phase. A raised respiratory rate indeed fulfilled SIRS criteria over more than two days, but before the leucocyte count increased, there was a stable trend towards improvement. Similar cases occurred in patients XI and XV: all formal SIRS criteria are recognized as such correctly by the system. However, there were no SIRS phases because other external effects as medication or specific therapies influenced the patient\u2019s temperature. Hence, it was not valid to use that for evaluation. In patient X on day 1, the system identified a SIRS phase on a wrong data basis: due to a transmission error from the bedside to the patient data management system, data on mechanical ventilation was missing. Hence, data was also missing in the openEHR data repository, and was not used in the reasoning process. 5 Discussion In this work, an interoperable CDSS for SIRS detection in pediatric intensive care was designed and successfully transferred into a feasible system. The pilot study and evaluation revealed the technical practicability of the described approach, which focuses on incorporating openEHR as clinical information modelling standard to achieve semantic interoperability in CDSS and support their cross-institutional reuse. 5.1 Implementation and evaluation of an interoperable CDSS We transferred the conceptual models into a prototypical implementation by using Drools, and achieved semantic interoperability in the CDSS by integrating openEHR Archetypes, binding terminologies and retrieving data via AQL. We successfully developed a CDSS, which consists of well-known CDSS components. By using rules as representation format, it was possible to capture domain-specific knowledge, which was needed for the reasoning processes (e.g., knowledge about age-specific norm values). The reasoning procedures were performed by the Drools rule engine, which in turn used the facts, which were inserted into a working memory. The facts were stored in the working memory in a standardized form because they were obtained from an openEHR based data repository by using AQL as query language. This approach potentially allows the CDSS to be implemented at other institutions without further modifications of queries or rules. However, therefore, the openEHR reference model and the use of Archetypes have to be implemented, and the quality of data has to be sufficient. For specifying age-specific norm values, it could be discussed whether normality ranges could be defined directly within the Archetype definitions. Although there are optional fields as clinical description for describing bradycardia or similar, there are no data elements for normality ranges. However, perhaps some of the elements of the reference model can be used for that purpose. Such a field could be defined (1) without further restrictions, so that it has to be filled out manually during documentation or (2) with a list of default values for different ages and/or conditions. (3) A value can be assigned to the field automatically according to entries for other attributes of the same Archetype, other Archetypes within the same Template or even the overall EHR. Up to now, there are no possibilities to implement such rules across multiple Archetypes. GDL should be used for such cases. Additionally, for approaches (2) and (3), there has to be strong evidence on the normality ranges before implementing any of them. In a previous project, we implemented another prototype by using a relational clinical data warehouse (using Microsoft SQL Server) and comparable, but more complex, SQL queries. Institutions, who want to implement this prototype or reuse SQL queries, have to implement the same local data structure. Here, the use of the same database query language is not enough. SQL is very powerful and allows more complex analytical-driven queries than the current version of AQL. For complex analytical tasks in clinical data settings, SPARQL might be another powerful query language. Although not needed within the use case of this paper, such complex querying functions might be needed elsewhere. However, the real benefit of AQL is the easy reuse at any institution implementing the openEHR reference model \u2013 independent of the persistence layer structure. Current work in the context of Archetype-based EHRs demonstrate that AQL even is interoperable with Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) or \u2018Big Data\u2019 solutions as distributed map-reduce frameworks such as Hadoop. Sundvall et al. [47] presented this by developing an AQL to Hadoop-querying translation using Dewey Encoding of openEHR models. In our use case of designing semantic interoperable CDSS, this characteristic of AQL appears more valuable than complex querying capabilities. Furthermore, within the presented architecture, AQL only is needed for identifying and extracting data elements. Any advanced operations and analyses also can be done afterwards, at the level of the rule engine. Nevertheless, because the openEHR AQL work group is aware of the need of more complex functions in other scenarios, current efforts exactly point in this direction (e.g., by discussing the development of an advanced AQL version for analytical purposes). Although we used rules as representation format and Drools as business rule management system, our conceptual design is independent of these choices. Hence, other representations as decision trees, semantic networks, neural networks or fuzzy logic approaches could be feasible as well [9]. As outlined in Section 3.3, Drools provides advanced features for processing of time events and data streams, which supported us in using Drools. In terms of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), which often also can be represented as rules, the formalization as computer-interpretable guidelines (CIGs) is another well-known approach [48]. An exemplary language for creating reusable CIGs is the Guideline Interchange Format (GLIF) [49]. Furthermore, the openEHR Guideline Definition Language (GDL) [45] can be used to create sharable rules and guidelines. Here, Archetypes can be used directly as in- and outputs of the reasoning process. We tried to represent the clinical logic of the SIRS use case by means of the GDL in previous work. However, the GDLEditor revealed weaknesses in handling and performance, and was not sufficient for extensive use in practice at that time. Furthermore, the representation of time-dependent rules and the use of sliding windows directly within the rules were not as easy as in Drools. With further developments of GDL, it could be assessed in future whether an implementation based on GDL might have benefits. In other settings, as in guideline compliance checking in large clinical registries as in stroke treatment (Anani et al. [50]) or in the establishment of clinical practice guidelines for chronic kidney diseases as GDL-based computer-interpretable guidelines [51], GDL already could be used with success. Also, other syntax as Arden Syntax [12] could be feasible. The evaluation outcomes of our pilot study are preliminary results that demonstrate the technical practicability of our approach on real clinical data. The CDSS already helped to identify SIRS phases, which otherwise would have stayed disregarded by the clinicians because of the current restricted computer support or a simple oversight of abnormal values (see Section 4). These insights support the need of advanced and continuous decision-support in the context of SIRS in pediatric intensive care. Although the pilot study is limited because of the restricted sample size, the technical realization of our approach for designing interoperable CDSS was shown. There were no technical bottlenecks, which hindered the realization and use of the system with real clinical data sets. The pilot study also gave first, very interesting results on the accuracy of the knowledge model. For example, it further has to be discussed, how external effects can be treated within the rules (e.g., therapies on reducing the body temperature or transmission errors between the bedside and patient data management systems). Nevertheless, the aforementioned sensitivity and specificity will not be treated as final results for estimating the diagnostic accuracy of our SIRS knowledge model. This research question is beyond the scope of this paper and will be examined during an extensive, more clinically-driven validation study. 5.2 Related work In terms of current work on semantic interoperability in CDSS, there are different initiatives proposing capable approaches (see [16,52]). The use of openEHR as clinical information standard when developing CDSS has been discussed previously. For example, Gonz\u00e1lez-Ferrer et al. [53] compared the use of openEHR Archetypes and HL7 virtual medical records (vMR) as intermediate schemas for representing clinical statements in CDSS. Similar to our understanding, they state that the mapping of clinical guideline statements into patients\u2019 data can be done most effectively via shared schemas. These allow data querying on a shared semantic level. Based on the results of a study, in which ten clinical statements were modelled and mapped to EHRs, valuable insights on using openEHR and vMR within the context of decision-support applications could be gained. Although the modelling and integration of openEHR Archetypes are time-intensive tasks, it was presented that the openEHR architecture provides advanced and detailed semantics, highly capable of representing clinical statements of guidelines. Furthermore, after studying the benefits and issues of openEHR, the authors are confident that Archetypes not only have a great potential for reuse in CDSS but also for data analysis [53]. Recently, Marco-Ruiz et al. [18] described a meta-architecture for Archetype- and non-knowledge-based CDSS. The approach considers following the dual model approach proposed by Beale et al. [34] as well as the integration of clinical terminologies, to overcome the mismatch between openEHR based EHRs and non-rule-based CDSS. However, the approach was not tested by implementing an application that realizes the components described. Hence, the feasibility and capability of their approach on real clinical data sets have not been proven yet. Because our approach used to gain interoperability in our CDSS is very similar, our work can contribute to close this research gap. Related work is also presented by Marcos et al. [17] in a series of articles [17,54,55]. In [17], they investigated the use of Archetypes to build a virtual health record (VHR) that serves as data basis for a CDSS. The approach allows automatic mapping of the source data items to Archetypes by using the LinkEHR Archetype mapping tool. A CDSS prototype, which is based on the PROforma guideline representation language [56] and supports the recruitment of patients for clinical trials in colorectal cancer screening, was implemented. To some extent, their approach is dependent on the use of PROforma because the use of the Tallis Engine is proposed for data access, instead of directly accessing Archetype data via AQL or GDL. Furthermore, published Archetypes from the CKM in fact were used but were specialized later to fit specific data sources. Based on this approach, Kopanitsa [57] presented a solution for an integration tool that supports the mapping between EHR data (as XML Schemas) and openEHR Archetypes by defining transformation and aggregation rules. The approach was evaluated by designing openEHR Archetypes for the use case of computerized quality control of medical treatments. The integration tool was used to transform treatment data of 10 clinics into openEHR compliant data and validate the accuracy of the mapping with experts. The accuracy results for the mappings were very promising but no further details on the solution for clinical decision-support respectively a clinical-driven evaluation of the CDSS are given in their work. The author concludes with the hypothesis that \u201cInference models in [\u2026] CDSS can benefit from this by defining queries to a valid data set with known structure and constraints\u201d [57]. Our work contributes to this hypothesis by presenting an AQL-based CDSS with complex knowledge-based inference models, which, through this approach, have great potentials to be correctly used and easy implemented at other institutions. One more idea on facilitating the integration of CDSS to EHRs is presented by Peleg et al. [58] with introducing the Knowledge-data ontological mapper (KDOM). KDOM allows a mapping of clinical guidelines to EHRs. Based on a mapping ontology and a reference information model, abstractions in clinical guidelines can be mapped to EHR codes and SQL queries can be created, and executed automatically, to extract EHR data. As in other similar approaches that focus on developing mediators for the mapping between CDSS modules and EHR data, as the Medical Database Adaptor (MEIDA) [59], the most challenging work still is the construction of mapping rules, ontologies or heuristics. However, because of the idea of reusing Archetypes, we think that an Archetype mapping as in [57] might be more valuable in a broader sense than mapping of specific computer-interpretable guidelines. Another emerging strategy to facilitate the easy reuse of CDSS functionalities is the design of supporting systems towards the paradigm of Service Oriented Architectures (SOA). Here, the CDSS was implemented as a web service and could be shared as such among clients [60]. The Decision Support Services (DSS) [61], introduced by Health Level 7 (HL7) and the Object Management Group (OMG), is a common guideline for implementing CDSS as software service. A reference implementation of HL7 DSS - using the aforementioned HL7 vMR as internal data model - was developed and promoted by the openCDS initiative [62]. Also the approach of providing decision support as a web service bears challenges, e.g., there might be a lack of \u201cclient-service semantic interoperability (SIOp)\u201d [60], as stated by Marco-Ruiz et al. [60]. The CDSS only can be reused correctly, if the client is aware of the semantics of the CDSS components and the input values, which are required for a correct reasoning. By reviewing related work on interoperable CDSS, it appears that finding a suitable standard for the representation of EHR data is not only a highly discussed topic, but acknowledged as a \u201c[\u2026] key aspect for achieving success in the promising area of Clinical Decision Support\u201d [63], as stated by Gonzales-Ferrer et al. Against this background, they presented an evaluation of three standards (HL7 CDA, HL7 vMR, openEHR) by means of a case study to explore challenges and benefits [63]. Four modelling experts compared the selected approaches on the basis of fifteen detailed criteria, composed into three classes. An extensive review of the evaluation is beyond of the scope of this paper. However, with respects to our work on developing a CDSS implementation based on real use case specific data, we are confident that our work contributes to enhance some of the openEHR-related findings. First, we agree with the authors that the mapping between the EHR data to Archetypes is not trivial but, for us, the conceptual fitness and learning curve criteria are not as poor as evaluated at that time of the publication anymore: much progress has been made with respects to the (search) functions of the CKM, the activities within the community and the global governance strategy. By help of a search strategy (e.g., try to concentrate on \u2018published\u2019 Archetypes first, search by the meaning of the Archetype classes, look into other regional CKM projects, consider the use and misuse, discussion and review sections within the CKM), we were able to identify Archetypes for our use case more easily. Furthermore, as seen in our work, the task of modelling Archetypes for the CDSS knowledge base only occurs once. Other institutions that want to make use of the CDSS simply can choose the Archetypes addressed and, thus, avoid spending resources on the knowledge engineering process. Furthermore, we solved the challenging knowledge-to-data-mapping by using AQL queries to retrieve the relevant data sets. Because queries are expressed on the Archetype level, no knowledge about the data structure is needed and the semantical correctness of the data submitted to the inference engine is supported. In [63], Gonzales-Ferrer et al. consider this approach as \u201ctheoretically advantageous\u201d and \u201cnot mature enough\u201d for practical use. Finally, because the authors state that there are no free tools for testing, and we implemented our system by using a commercial implementation, it is worth mentioning that nowadays there are initiatives as EtherCIS 3 3 http://ethercis.org/ providing an open source openEHR-platform, which also supports AQL. 5.3 Limitations and future work Limitations within this work are present in regards to knowledge acquisition and representation, as already outlined in Section 5.1. Our approach allows the opportunity for an easy reuse of the CDSS at any institution, which implements the openEHR reference model and uses standard terminologies. By using semantic interoperability standards, the system inference logics and knowledge bases are functionally independent of the underlying local systems. This potentially allows a \u2018plug-and-play\u2019-as integration of the system at other institutions that are using the same standard for clinical information modelling. Furthermore, we are confident that the concept, which was designed in cooperation with medical experts and with respect to international SIRS recommendations (consensus conference), considers all relevant SIRS knowledge assets. Nevertheless, our reasoning process might not be fully interoperable. Some institutions might wish to implement exactly their reasoning schema (e.g., in matters of the minimum overlapping time of parameter alarms). Even so our approach allows such adaptions, we further aspire to validate and enhance the concept by conducting further clinical-driven studies within and across institutions. The involvement of other external medical experts is planned as well. As a next step, the preliminary results of the pilot study of this work will be used as a basis to conduct an extensive study with up to 300 patients, and more than two medical experts, to further assess the CDSS knowledge base. Here, we will focus on evaluating the rule-based knowledge model of SIRS detection in pediatric intensive care rather than determining the technical practicability of our overall approach for designing interoperable CDSS. There are additional conditions of SIRS, which are not integrated up to now because of missing and inaccessible data sets. For example, medications have not been semantically enriched and integrated into our openEHR based data repository yet. However, because our approach focuses on extensibility, the knowledge base extension with further criteria and rules - including sepsis and organ dysfunction criteria - is possible and should be considered as future work. Currently, our CDSS is based on a data repository, which comprises legacy data sets. Hence, we tested the system on retrospective data sets and former cases. To establish the system in clinical routine, it must be capable of recognizing and assessing new data sets. Because this does not affect the reasoning procedures or knowledge bases needed, they can be reused within such a live system as they are. Some modifications, e.g., in terms of implementing a database listener to obtain new data sets or integrating the graphical user interface and the reasoning results in existing patient data management systems, can be accomplished. The scope of our work and the limitations open up a major direction for further research, which we would like to address in near future. Since RCTs are rare in pediatric critical and intensive care, and the evidence level is low compared to adult care [44], CDSS could provide valuable insights to overcome the lack of evidence. In SIRS settings, the lack of high-quality evidence already becomes obvious when highlighting that 76 adult-specific, but only 22 pediatric-specific recommendations for SIRS diagnosis and treatment exist [44]. Especially in knowledge-intensive tasks, it might not be possible to define a generally applicable knowledge model. The establishment of non-knowledge-based systems that follow a data-driven reasoning approach might help to address the need of aligning the knowledge model to individual opinions, local procedures and knowledge bases of different institutions. Then, the knowledge model will be constructed automatically out of the data basis. Such CDSS in pediatric intensive care can be particularly beneficial, when they are designed according to the principles of learning healthcare systems, as proposed by Tim Foley and Fergus Fairmichael in the Learning Healthcare Project [64]. By using our CDSS for recognizing SIRS as a basis, we aim at investigating the potentials of machine learning algorithms that work on the basis of cross-institutional training data sets in pediatric intensive care settings. The existence of an interoperable clinical decision-support system, which can be adapted in other institutions, is a basic requirement for this research purpose. Hence, the work presented within this paper could serve as a starting point. It further has to be explored, which advanced machine learning algorithms best fit to learn from historical events, or to reveal yet unknown patterns or relations between vital signs, laboratory values and other criteria relevant for SIRS, sepsis or organ dysfunctions in Pediatrics [4,7,65]. To test and train such algorithms in adult care and neonatology, the MIMIC-III Critical Care Database might perfectly serve as a training database [66]. Because no pediatric critical care data is included, we have to use our own training data provided by our CDSS. Against the background of distributed machine learning, it even can be hypothesized that a widespread provision of openly available training data at a central access point won\u2019t be required in future anymore. By a widespread and long-term collection, intelligent analysis and interpretation of data from various systems and sites, it might be possible to train continuously train models, and to draw new generalizable conclusions about critical pediatric diagnoses and therapies directly out of the data basis. New insights might be send back to both, the system and clinical practice, which might result in a long-term learning and changing process. Because our system performed well within a first proof-of-concept study, we will pursue this work by conducting further studies and research on the clinical domain. Gaining deeper knowledge about further semantic interoperability features and the cognitive reasoning process of clinical experts will help to optimize the system. Furthermore, the application of the system at other institutions is intended. 6 Conclusions Within this work, we demonstrated the design of an interoperable CDSS by incorporating openEHR as clinical information modelling standard, LOINC terminology and Drools as formalisms for knowledge representation, and AQL as standardized and semantically-enriched query language. We were able to mostly use internationally agreed-upon openEHR Archetypes, which represent the SIRS concepts at pediatric intensive care units. We integrated the data sets into an openEHR based data repository. By using AQL and incorporating terminologies, we successfully retrieved clinically relevant data sets from that data repository in a standardized, unambiguous and semantically-enriched form. Hence, weak sensitivity and specificity of the CDSS at other institutions, which might occur due to different understandings of the data sets that are inserted into the knowledge base, can be prevented. We successfully transferred our concept into a prototype and evaluated the practicability on clinical data sets and in close cooperation with medical experts. To the author\u2019s knowledge, currently, there are no openEHR based CDSS approaches which have been implemented and evaluated with such complex and important clinical contexts. Hence, we successfully designed the first clinically evaluated CDSS based on openEHR. When enhancing the described approach and implementing a live system, it might support clinicians to identify the patient\u2019s course of disease at an early stage, which can lead to better outcome for the patient. Furthermore, the system can serve as a basis for integrating (cross-institutional) machine learning components that could facilitate dealing with other high-complex decision problems or revealing yet unknown disease patterns.

Although many approaches for designing CDSS have been proposed, due to high implementation costs, as well as the lack of interoperability features, current solutions are not well-established across different institutions. Recently, the use of standardized formalisms for knowledge representation as terminologies as well as the integration of semantically enriched clinical information models, as openEHR Archetypes, and their reuse within CDSS are theoretically considered as key factors for reusable CDSS. Objective We aim at developing and evaluating an openEHR based approach to achieve interoperability in CDSS by designing and implementing an exemplary system for automated systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) detection in pediatric intensive care. Methods We designed an interoperable concept, which enables an easy integration of the CDSS across different institutions, by using openEHR Archetypes, terminology bindings and the Archetype Query Language (AQL). The practicability of the approach was tested by (1) implementing a prototype, which is based on an openEHR based data repository of the Hannover Medical School (HaMSTR), and (2) conducting a first pilot study. Results We successfully designed and implemented a CDSS with interoperable knowledge bases and interfaces by reusing internationally agreed-upon Archetypes, incorporating LOINC terminology and creating AQL queries, which allowed retrieving dynamic facts in a standardized and unambiguous form. The technical capabilities of the system were evaluated by testing the prototype on 16 randomly selected patients with 129 days of stay, and comparing the results with the assessment of clinical experts (leading to a sensitivity of 1.00, a specificity of 0.94 and a Cohen\u2019s kappa of 0.92). Conclusions We found the use of openEHR Archetypes and AQL a feasible approach to bridge the interoperability gap between local infrastructures and CDSS. The designed concept was successfully transferred into a clinically evaluated openEHR based CDSS. To the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first openEHR based CDSS, which is technically reliable and capable in a real context, and facilitates clinical decision-support for a complex task. Further activities will comprise enrichments of the knowledge base, the reasoning processes and cross-institutional evaluations.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2018-07-31", "openaccessUserLicense": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0933365717304402", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Wulff, Antje"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Haarbrandt, Birger"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Tute, Erik"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Marschollek, Michael"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Beerbaum, Philipp"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Jack, Thomas"}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0933365717304402"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365717304402"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": "Full", "pii": "S0933-3657(17)30440-2", "prism:volume": "89", "prism:publisher": "The Authors.
