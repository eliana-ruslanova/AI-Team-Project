Google promotes a new form of \u201cinfrastructural intelligence,\u201d which excels by constantly reassessing its cognitive architecture in exchange with a cloud of data that surrounds it, and exhibits putatively human capacities such as intuition. I argue that such (re)alignments of biological and artificial intelligence have been enabled by a paradigmatic infrastructuralization of the brain in contemporary neuroscience. This infrastructuralization is based in methodologies that epistemically liken the brain to complex systems of an entirely different scale (i.e., global logistics) and has given rise to diverse research efforts that target the neuronal infrastructures of higher cognitive functions such as empathy and creativity. What is at stake in this process is no less than the shape of brains to come and a revised understanding of the intelligent and creative social subject.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial intelligence"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Computational neuroscience"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Brain imaging"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Google DeepMind technologies"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Default mode network"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0079612317300547", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079612317300547", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85026417410", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85026417410", "pubmed-id": "28826509", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85026417410", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20170731", "$": "2017-07-31"}}}}}
