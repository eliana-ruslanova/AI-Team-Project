We discuss the origin of AI, progress to machine learning, and then discuss how the limits of machine learning lead data scientists to develop artificial neural networks and deep learning algorithms through biomimicry. We will place all these technologies in the context of practical clinical examples and show how AI can act as a tool to support and amplify human cognitive functions for physicians delivering care to increasingly complex patients. The aim of this article is to provide the reader with a basic understanding of the fundamentals of AI. Its purpose is to demystify this technology for practicing surgeons so they can better understand how and where to apply it.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "artificial intelligence"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "machine learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "deep learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "cognitive computing"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "digital orthopedics"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "digital health"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0883540318302158", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883540318302158", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85045344385", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85045344385", "pubmed-id": "29656964", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85045344385", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20180227", "$": "2018-02-27"}}}}}
