Key Words automated analysis echocardiography ejection fraction image processing strain ventricular function Assessment of left ventricular (LV) volumes and ejection fraction (EF) is critical to decision making in valvular heart disease, heart failure, and post-infarct care with 2-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) usually serving this task. Unfortunately, even in 2015, 2DE quantitation remains quite imperfect, with EF commonly calculated by manually traced boundaries or, worse yet, the time-honored \u201ceyeball\u201d method. We know such approaches lack reproducibility and precision, yet we continue to make critical therapeutic decisions on their basis. Thus, any approach that improves the accuracy of echocardiographic quantitation would be immensely valuable. In this issue of the Journal, Knackstedt et al. (1) describe a potentially groundbreaking advance in the rapid and reproducible measurement of EF. Using prototype software that can work on any DICOM-stored echocardiograms, they showed that with an average processing time of 8 s, they could deliver an EF that provided better agreement with laborious manual techniques than did visual assessment. As a bonus, the software provides global longitudinal strain, a parameter shown to be a sensitive index of subclinical LV dysfunction (2,3). The paper itself describes a validation study with both points of commendation and critique. Four centers provided 255 usable 2DE studies from which EF was estimated locally by both visual and biplane manual techniques. These studies were then reanalyzed in a core facility, which provided visual, manual, and automated EF measurements for comparison with the local values. A selection of studies was reanalyzed to provide inter- and intraobserver variability data. This leads to a panoply of regression plots and Bland-Altman analyses with the following general conclusions: 1) intraclass correlation coefficients for the 10 combinations of the 5 measurements (local visual and manual, core visual, manual, and automated) ranged from 0.70 to 0.87, meaning that only 49% to 76% of the variance in one method could be accounted for by another, with the remaining 24% to 51% being random error; 2) similar combinations of Bland-Altman analyses showed 95% confidence ranges in EF between methods of 35% to 42% (\u201cMr. Jones, we can state with confidence that your ejection fraction is somewhere between 25% and 65%\u2026\u201d); and 3) the automated method showed better reproducibility than visual or manual methods. Because it uses a deterministic algorithm, automated analysis of the same cardiac cycle will always give the same EF, but, more importantly, when clips from different cardiac cycles were used, the scatter from the automated method was less than one-half that of the manual method for both EF and longitudinal strain. So the new automated method is clearly more reproducible than the user-defined methods, but is it more accurate? Here, unfortunately, this study does not provide much of an answer because there was no reference standard against which to compare the results\u2014no 3-dimensional echocardiography, no computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), no in vitro validation. Although the authors argue, with some justification, that the biplane method has been validated against these \u201cgold\u201d standards, seeing the automated method validated directly would increase confidence in the method. The quest for automated analysis of echocardiograms goes back more than 30 years. The senior author recalls a freezer-sized instrument, the Pipelined Image Processing Engine (PIPE), which could perform complex edge detection algorithms on echocardiograms at the real-time video rate, requiring processing power that was astonishing in the 1980s but can easily be matched by any Smartphone today (4). In the early 1990s, acoustic quantification (5) and its polychromatic offspring color kinesis (6) were touted as automated methods, but proved too dependent on image quality and gain to be useful in daily practice. More recently, several algorithms (cited by Knackstedt et al.) have used combinations of edge detection and pattern matching to estimate the EF. Although reasonable results have been reported, most of these have proven more time-consuming than the approach described here and are not widely used. In this regard, it is unfortunate that we do not know more about the specific algorithm used by Knackstedt et al. It is simply described as a \u201ccomputer vision-vendor independent software package that applies a machine learning algorithm for DICOM images\u201d with a generic reference to a 2006 book. How does it balance local edge detection with global pattern matching? What is the image experience base on which the algorithm is based? Against which gold standard was it matched? We simply do not know and must hope for a detailed technical description in the future. A critical issue is how it handles ventricular trabeculations. This point is the key reason why echocardiography, which highlights the cavity side of trabeculae, consistently yields lower volumes than CT and MRI, which emphasize the myocardial side of them (7). Although the EF tends to self-correct (because both end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes seek the same boundaries for a given modality), the volumes themselves are quite different, and this critically affects our ability to quantify cardiac output, regurgitant volume, and intracardiac shunts. The addition of echocardiographic contrast, by filling in the trabeculae, largely normalizes echocardiographic to CT/MRI volumes (8,9). Accordingly, when we are training our \u201cmachine learning\u201d algorithms, a key mandate should be to yield volumes that, with or without contrast, match tomographic standards. Of course, no automated method can be better than the images fed to it, with foreshortening a key problem. To counteract this, we encourage 3-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) and hope to soon see 8-s volumes and strain in 3DE datasets. Turning now to the issue of strain, encouraging results are reported, but again much of the methodology remains opaque. As promising as strain is in cardio-oncology, valve disease, and ischemic disease, it has suffered in the past from poor intervendor reproducibility, leading to the formation of a Task Force on Strain Standardization by the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging and the American Society of Echocardiography. This has already produced encouraging convergence among hardware and software vendors in methodology (10) and in human (11) and in vitro (12) studies. An automated approach to strain across hardware vendors would indeed be welcome, but unfortunately Knackstedt et al. provide no information on which vendor platforms their studies were performed. Other unknowns: What is the transmural width of the strain sample volume? What was the trigger for the beginning of systole? What marked the end of systole? Is there an option to look at regional strain? It is not even clear what manual software with which this was compared, presumably the currently available Tomtec product (Hamden, Connecticut). Although the authors dutifully (at the behest of a reviewer) provided a regression equation to predict the EF from strain and demonstrated excellent correlation, we would hope that strain not be relegated to an EF surrogate. Strain is at its most useful when it diverges from EF, and the 2 indexes should be considered separately. All in all, however, this appears to be a very promising method, and we salute both the investigators and the engineers who developed the algorithm (and who too often are forgotten). There is much more investigation needed with volumetric gold standards and a wide range of hardware platforms, hopefully with extension to 3DE. The appeal of this automated software interpretation system is great, but we must always ensure that we are dealing with \u201ctrue\u201d as opposed to \u201cartificial\u201d intelligence.
