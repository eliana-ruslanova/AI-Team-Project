Methodologies for auditing SNOMED based on structural aspects of its organization are presented. In particular, automated techniques for partitioning SNOMED into smaller groups of concepts based primarily on relationships patterns are defined. Two abstraction networks, the area taxonomy and p-area taxonomy, are derived from the partitions. The high-level views afforded by these abstraction networks form the basis for systematic auditing. The networks tend to highlight errors that manifest themselves as irregularities at the abstract level. They also support group-based auditing, where sets of purportedly similar concepts are focused on for review. The auditing methodologies are demonstrated on one of SNOMED\u2019s top-level hierarchies. Errors discovered during the auditing process are reported. Keywords SNOMED Terminology Auditing Quality assurance Partitioning Abstraction network Taxonomy Group-based auditing 1 Introduction The SNOMED CT\u2014the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms\u2014(\u201cSNOMED,\u201d for short) [1] is one of the leading health care terminologies, currently being used in over 40 countries worldwide. It has proven to be an invaluable resource to the healthcare and biomedical community, with uses ranging from electronic medical records and clinical laboratory systems to outcomes assessment and telemedicine. SNOMED\u2019s importance has been further acknowledged by its complete incorporation into the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) [2,3]. Originally released in the year 2002, its January 2004 release, used in this research, comprises over 357,000 concepts, more than 1.37 million relationships, and a subsumption hierarchy that is 31 levels deep. Due to SNOMED\u2019s broad scope and inherent complexity, it is unavoidable that errors will find their way into SNOMED\u2019s knowledge content, particularly as it continues to expand. (This, of course, is true of other leading terminologies as well.) Thus, an auditing regimen is essential to ensure the integrity of its contents. In this paper, we present structural auditing methodologies based on partitioning and abstraction to aid in the auditing of SNOMED. In particular, we present partitioning techniques that are applicable to different aspects of SNOMED\u2019s content. These techniques are based on features of the structural make-up of SNOMED. The resulting finer partitions, in fact, consist of collections of concepts that are similar in both structure and semantics. From the partitions, we derive different abstraction networks for SNOMED called taxonomies. Such networks afford compact views of the gestalt of SNOMED and allow the auditor to see it from new perspectives. There are two levels of taxonomies that permit the auditor to view the concept hierarchy at different levels of granularity. In particular, the area taxonomy helps to highlight irregularities in the terminology structure, while the p-area taxonomy reveals more refined structure and semantic information. The taxonomies form the basis for three auditing methodologies we present. The first of these detects errors that have manifested themselves as structural irregularities at the abstract level in the area taxomony. The second investigates irregularities occurring within the p-area taxonomy. The p-area taxonomy also supports the third methodology, group-based auditing, where sets of purportedly similar concepts are focused on for review. Our partitioning, abstraction, and auditing methodologies are demonstrated on one of SNOMED\u2019s top-level hierarchies: the Specimen hierarchy. Errors discovered during the auditing process are reported. 2 Background 2.1 SNOMED The SNOMED CT [1,4,5]\u2014the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms\u2014is a clinical terminology developed as a joint venture between the College of American Pathologists (CAP) and the UK\u2019s National Health Service (NHS). It was formed by merging, expanding, and restructuring an earlier version of SNOMED (i.e., SNOMED RT) and the UK\u2019s Clinical Terms Version 3 (CTV3). SNOMED\u2019s concepts are organized in 18 top-level hierarchies (as of the Jan \u201904 release), each with a unique root called a top-level concept. Above all these top-level concepts sits a single concept called SNOMED CT Concept, which serves as the root of the entire terminology. Each concept is a descendant of SNOMED CT Concept via a sequence of IS-A (subsumption) relationships passing through exactly one top-level concept. Descriptions are the terms, or names, assigned to each of SNOMED\u2019s concepts. A given concept has one or more associated descriptions. One of them is called the \u201cFully Specified Name\u201d (FSN), which is a unique phrase that describes a concept in a way that is intended to be unambiguous. All concepts have one description which is designated as a \u201cpreferred term\u201d for each language edition. (The preferred term is different for UK English, US English, and, of course, Spanish.) Many concepts have alternative descriptions called \u201csynonyms.\u201d Most of SNOMED\u2019s top-level hierarchies represent broad groupings of clinically related concepts. Among them, we have Clinical Finding, Procedure, Body Structure, Organism, Pharmaceutical/Biologic Product, etc. Three of the hierarchies, namely, Attribute, Qualifier Value, and Special Concept, serve more specific structural roles in the terminology. Relationships are the connections between concepts in SNOMED, with every concept having at least one relationship to another concept. Relationships in SNOMED are unidirectional, extending from a source concept to a target concept. Inverse relationships (from target to source) are not maintained. There are two general kinds of relationships in SNOMED: 1. IS-A relationships (already noted above), that form the basis of the hierarchies. Each connects a more specific concept (a child) to a more general concept (a parent). 2. Attribute relationships, that characterize and define concepts. Each can take on values (targets) only from a prescribed top-level hierarchy. A particular attribute relationship comprises its source concept, its relationship type (defined as a separate SNOMED concept in its own right), and a value (another concept). These three together are called the \u201cObject-Attribute-Value\u201d (OAV) triplet. For brevity, we will refer to \u201cattribute relationship\u201d as \u201crelationship,\u201d while \u201cIS-A relationship\u201d will be referred to as such. Relationships in SNOMED are our major interests when we apply the partitioning techniques and construct abstraction networks for auditing. There are 46 relationship types (in the January \u201904 release) aside from IS-A. An example is has active ingredient introduced in the Pharmaceutical/Biologic product hierarchy and directed to concepts in the Substance hierarchy. Some hierarchies introduce many relationships. For example, the Procedure hierarchy introduces 22 relationships. 2.2 Abstraction networks In the course of extensive research on terminologies and ontologies over the past 20 years, it has become apparent that their maintenance (including auditing) is greatly enhanced by high-level abstraction networks, particularly those derived from partitions, i.e., groupings of concepts into smaller, more manageable collections. SNOMED\u2019s designers decided to partition their terminology into 18 top-level hierarchies, with each concept residing in exactly one of these. With respect to the UMLS, an abstraction feature was considered paramount and the Semantic Network was thus built as one of its fundamental knowledge sources [6,7]. In [8], we presented a refined Semantic Network (SN) of the UMLS which offers a partition of the UMLS Metathesaurus into disjoint sets of concepts with similar semantics, not offered by the SN. Later work went even further with a proposal for an additional layer of abstraction, a partition of the SN\u2019s semantic types into various subject areas [9,10]. We introduced the notion of metaschema of the SN [11,12] as another form of additional level of abstraction. As a matter of fact, most of the papers in a special issue of the Journal of Biomedical Informatics on Structural Issues in UMLS Research [13] utilize the interplay between the SN and the Metathesaurus [14,15] in one way or another. In [16\u201318], we presented an abstraction network for the Medical Entities Dictionary (MED) [19] that partitions it into disjoint sets of concepts of similar structure and semantics. Beyond the field of medical informatics, the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO) [20,21], developed toward the IEEE Standard Upper Ontology, and the mapping of WordNet [22] to SUMO [23] have been conceived in this spirit of abstraction. The large CYC project, an ontological effort to model everyday, common-sense knowledge [24,25], was found to be doomed to failure, relative to the goals of its designers, without an abstraction mechanism in the form of high-level contexts. 2.3 Auditing Auditing large terminologies is a serious challenge facing the medical informatics community. Terminologies are typically huge in size and have high complexity, making comprehensive audits very difficult\u2014indeed, overwhelming\u2014tasks. We refer here to complexity of a terminology as the ratio of the number of relationships (edges) to the number of concepts (nodes) as defined in [26]. Various auditing approaches have been applied in the context of the UMLS. For example, [27] proposed to use semantic methods to uncover concept classification errors. In [28,29], techniques were developed for discovering errors in concept hierarchies (e.g., cycles). The issue of balancing the problems of concept redundancy and ambiguity was addressed in [30]. Object-oriented models and databases have been constructed to support maintenance [8,31]. In [32], a meta-level abstraction of the Semantic Network called a metaschema [11] was used to locate concepts having a high likelihood of errors. A method for finding undetected synonymy in the UMLS has been presented in [33]. A method to find redundant categorizations is found in [34]. Auditing of SNOMED based on ontological and linguistic techniques is discussed in [35,36]. In this paper, we take an approach based entirely on structural aspects of the terminology\u2019s representation. We define a partitioning methodology that yields sets of structurally similar concepts. Our auditing is done by expert manual review of such sets which highlight concepts that have a good chance of being in error. A similar approach to auditing the MED is presented in [16]. However, as we shall see in the next section, the situation with SNOMED is more complex. 2.4 Previous work We originally introduced the notion of an area taxonomy in [37] as a structural abstraction network for a terminology in the context of work on auditing the NCI Thesaurus (NCIT) [38]. The technique was applied to the NCIT\u2019s small Biological Process hierarchy, which consisted of 589 concepts and had seven relationships defined for these concepts. An area taxonomy and partial area taxonomy for that hierarchy were derived. Our initial formulation was meaningfully influenced by the nature of NCIT\u2019s Biological Process hierarchy, on which the area and p-area taxonomies were demonstrated. As it happened, the Biological Process hierarchy was effectively a tree structure, where each concept had just one parent. (In fact, only four concepts had more than one parent, and following our feedback the hierarchy was reorganized into a strict tree structure [37].) The tree-structured hierarchy did not require the full scope of taxonomic development that a directed acyclic graph (DAG) terminology does, as is manifested in the current paper. It was natural, in fact, to proceed from the easier to the harder and first tackle the tree-structured case and only then extend our methodologies to the DAG case. In this paper, unlike in [37], we deal with the fact that the division of an area into p-areas is not necessarily a partition, as p-areas may overlap due to concepts having multiple parents. Moreover, the presence of multiple parents enables a kind of relationship obtainment pattern, called a strict inheritance region, that cannot occur with a tree-structured hierarchy such as NCIT\u2019s Biological Process. We also formally introduce an intermediate abstraction unit, called the region, that fits between areas and p-areas. This augments the p-area taxonomy. Regions are derived according to the relationship obtainment patterns exhibited by an area. All p-areas having a specific obtainment pattern are grouped into the same region. As we will show, strict inheritance regions, existing only for a DAG-structured terminology hierarchy, tend to contain concepts with a high degree of errors, and are of special importance to the auditing process. Finally, we introduce two new auditing methodologies supported by taxonomies which did not appear in the previous paper [37]. The first is based on structural irregularities in an area taxonomy (Section 3.5.1). The second is group-based auditing (Section 3.5.3). In previous work [17,18] on the MED [19], we introduced an abstraction network called a schema. We demonstrated the usefulness of the schema for structural orientation and auditing [16]. In this paper, we demonstrate the ways in which taxonomy is a necessary alternative to the schema. As an example, the schema could not accommodate the situation where the same relationship is introduced at multiple, independent points in the terminology\u2019s hierarchy. A schema can only accommodate a given relationship introduction at a unique concept [17]. The taxonomy remedies this deficiency (see Section 3.3). We describe the natural progression from the schema to the area taxonomy and on to the augmented p-area taxonomy. 3 Methods The concepts of SNOMED are organized in a subsumption hierarchy utilizing IS-As. Concepts\u2019 other relationships capture the associative knowledge of the terminology. Ordinarily, a concept\u2019s relationships are inherited from its parent concepts via the IS-As. However, for each kind of relationship, there is always a top concept in the hierarchy at which it first appears. Such a concept is characterized by the fact that the particular relationship does not appear at any of the parents. We call such concepts introducing concepts. Our partitioning methodology focuses primarily on the sets of relationships exhibited by various concepts. In particular, we use the similarity and disparity of such sets as the basis for partitioning of the terminology. Relationships are given primacy because of their overall definitional importance in terminologies. The reasoning underlying our approach is that dividing with respect to relationships along structural lines yields groups which are also likely to be semantically uniform. Furthermore, we seek a partition into groups of concepts that are semantically cohesive, as defined in terms of having a unique root concept. This provides a second dimension of division and results in two levels of partition granularity. From the various partitions, abstraction networks called area taxonomies are derived automatically. An analysis similar to that described in Section 3.1, based on both attributes and relationships, has previously been carried out [16,17] with respect to the MED [19]. The MED analysis assumed the uniqueness of all property introductions. That is, a given property, whether it be an attribute or relationship, must be introduced at exactly one introducing concept in the terminology. This constraint is relaxed in the analysis below, as SNOMED and other terminologies do not exhibit uniqueness of relationship introductions. As a consequence, the analysis becomes more complex. 3.1 Areas and schemas The first phase of partitioning focuses on the distribution pattern of relationships in the terminology and is based on the notion of area. In the following, we use structure of a concept to denote a concept\u2019s complete set of relationships. An area is a collection of all concepts with the exact same structure. It can be seen that all areas are disjoint since a concept will belong to one and only one of them. Hence, the areas of a terminology form a partition. We define structure with respect to an area to be the structure of its constituent concepts. A concept is a root of its area if all its parent(s) are not in the area. (As a special case, a concept without parents is defined to be a root.) That is, a root is characterized by having parents with different structures. As a consequence of the fact that an introducing concept is the first point at which a given relationship appears, such a concept will be a root of its area. A root is a generalization of all its descendants in an area and thus conveys the overarching semantics of the set. An area may have one or more roots. Let us first consider the simpler case of a singly rooted area. In such a case, the root concept neatly conveys the prevailing semantics of the whole area. For this reason, we name such an area after its root. Let us look at an abstract example to illustrate these ideas for singly rooted areas. Fig. 1 shows a terminology fragment with five introducing concepts, A through E, and some other unlabeled concepts that do not introduce any new relationships. All concepts are drawn as rounded rectangles. The unlabeled, thick arrows stand for IS-A relationships among concepts. Other labeled arrows represent the relationships between the two concepts. For example, the arrow from A to C labeled r 1 means that A has a relationship r 1 with C. Concepts A through E introduce the relationships r 1, r 2, r 3, r 3 \u2032 (the converse of r 3), and r 4, respectively. Note that the children and grandchildren of A all exhibit the relationship r 1 (and only that relationship in this terminology fragment) due to inheritance. Therefore, all these are grouped into an area called A, after the root, drawn as a box enclosing its constituent concepts. While concept B (a great-grandchild of A) also inherits r 1, it introduces the relationship r 2. So, B and its descendants exhibit the two relationships r 1 and r 2 and are grouped in area B. We similarly have the areas C, D, and E. Following our analysis of the MED [16,17], we can automatically derive an abstraction network, called an area schema, from the partition into areas as follows. For each area in the partition, a single corresponding node\u2014labeled with the area\u2019s name\u2014is defined in the schema. For conciseness, we refer to the node in the schema as an area, too. One area B is defined as a child-of of another area A\u2014and is connected to it via an unlabeled, thick arrow\u2014if the root of area B IS-A some concept (not necessarily the root) in area A. A relationship r is directed from area X to area Y if the root of area X introduces or inherits a relationship r whose target is some concept (not necessarily the root) in area Y. Note that for the definitions of both kinds of relationships, the target concept is not required to be the root of its area. Only the source concept of the relationship is required to be the root. This guarantees that all concepts of the area share the relationships of the root (and thus the area) whether those relationships are introduced at the root or inherited from the parent area. The inheritance is enabled at the source of the relationship. The target is inherited with the relationship kind. Overall, the schema abstractly displays the relationships exhibited by the various areas of similar concepts. It differentiates among the various kinds of concepts based on their differing structures. In particular, the semantics of one group of concepts is clearly distinguished from that of another group if each group exhibits a different structure. The naming convention for nodes makes each introducing concept a focal point. This is warranted because such a concept is where new semantics is introduced, paving the way for the spread of the new knowledge in the portion of the hierarchy below it. Hence, in the area schema, the name of an area expresses the semantics of its concepts, and its structure expresses the structure of its concepts. Thus, the area schema captures both the structure and semantics of a terminology in a compact and abstract way. Fig. 2 shows the area schema derived from Fig. 1, consisting of five areas, two child-of relationships, and five relationships. As can be seen, this area schema is a compact representation of the prevailing relationship pattern of the terminology fragment. 3.2 Multi-rooted areas An underlying assumption in the development of the area schema of the MED, guaranteeing singly rooted areas, was that each kind of relationship be introduced at a unique concept in the terminology. However, such a unique introduction point is not a natural requirement for a terminology. SNOMED and other terminologies do not adhere to this. Under the condition of unique introduction points, all areas are guaranteed to be singly rooted. Multiple introduction points for a given relationship imply that an area can have multiple roots. While the partition of concepts into areas with multiple roots is straightforward, complications do arise with respect to the area schemas. For example, consider Fig. 3 , where we see five areas. The interesting one is on the lower left side and contains two roots, X and Y, and their respective children. The concept X introduces the relationship r directed at concept W, which happens to be the unique root of its area. The concept Y also introduces r, which in this case is directed at Z, also the unique root of its area. Since X, Y, and their children all exhibit r, they are placed together in an area, as shown in Fig. 3. Meanwhile, the ancestor A of X and Y introduces the relationship r 1 directed at B, the parent of W and Z. B itself introduces no relationship. In addition, Z introduces the relationship r 2 targeted at W, while the converse relationship r 2 \u2032 points from W to Z. There are problems with an area schema for this configuration. First, what do we call this area rooted at X and Y? None of the two roots is a generalization of all concepts of the area and thus none of them is appropriate as a name of the area. A second problem is that if we let the relationship r head in multiple directions from this area to areas W and Z, it conveys the knowledge that for each concept of the area there are two relationships r, one to a concept of the area W and one to a concept of the area Z. But this configuration is not applicable to any concepts in this area. Hence, there is no natural area schema for the terminology fragment of Fig. 3. 3.3 Area taxonomy Due to the above problems, we introduce an alternative abstract view called an area taxonomy. The term \u201ctaxonomy\u201d typically denotes a terminology\u2019s entire set of concepts and the hierarchical IS-A relationships connecting them [39,40]. The non-IS-A relationships are not included. Similarly, an area taxonomy graphically consists of only the area nodes and hierarchical child-of relationships (defined as in the area schema) connecting them. Note that an area taxonomy is acyclic, since a cycle in the area taxonomy will imply a cycle of IS-A relationships in the underlying hierarchy, which is impossible due to the hierarchical nature of IS-A relationships. Relationship arrows other than those for child-of are not defined as part of the area taxonomy. The only information pertaining to such relationships is maintained inside an area node in textual form. As a matter of fact, the set of relationships defined for an area node (i.e., its structure) is used as its name to overcome the above area\u2019s naming problem for multi-rooted areas. The targets of the relationships are not represented in any way. So, the area taxonomy ignores the targets of relationships, and instead concentrates on the relationships\u2019 names. Hence, it avoids the above two problems that prevented us from defining an area schema. Fig. 4 shows the area taxonomy for the terminology fragment of Fig. 3, where the rectangles are area nodes and the solid arrows stand for child-of relationships between area nodes. The area rooted at A in Fig. 3 is named { r 1 \u2217 } , 1 In the text, an area will be denoted by listing its relationship(s) in a pair of braces. Commas will separate multiple relationships. 1 the relationship it introduces. The \u201c\u2217\u201d indicates that r 1 is introduced in this particular area. The area with the two roots X and Y is named after its relationships r and r 1. In particular, its name {r 1, r \u2217} indicates that this area inherits (via its roots) the relationship r 1 and introduces the new relationship r, as again denoted by the \u201c\u2217\u201d. The area rooted at B in Fig. 3 exhibits no relationships, so we name it \u2205, the symbol for the empty set. The area taxonomy succeeds in providing a compact, abstract, structural view of a terminology. That is, an area contains all the concepts of the terminology sharing the same structure, and this structure is used to name the area. However, the area taxonomy fails to provide semantic uniformity, as illustrated by the concepts X and Y in the multi-rooted area of Fig. 3. Their different semantics is manifested by having the targets for the common relationship r in two different areas, W and Z, and by the lack of one concept as a generalization of all concepts in this multi-rooted area. To illustrate the definitions and further demonstrate the details of the area taxonomy in the context of SNOMED, Fig. 5 shows an excerpt of the area taxonomy for the Specimen hierarchy. While Figs. 3 and 4 followed a graph model where each concept (area) was displayed as a node in a semantic network, Fig. 5 simply lists some of the concepts in their area boxes. (The ellipsis \u201c\u2026\u201d indicates the omission of other concepts.) An area is named by its list of relationships enclosed in braces, e.g., {specimen substance, specimen procedure \u2217, specimen source morphology \u2217} in the lower left of Fig. 5. A relationship may be marked by a \u201c\u2217\u201d indicating that it is introduced at the particular area. (The \u201c+\u201d marking will be explained in Section 3.4.2.) Thick arrows are child-of relationships between areas. The concept indentation within an area box indicates IS-A relationships. IS-A relationships across areas are drawn as thin arrows. These concept-to-concept arrows are not part of an area\u2019s definition, but are included to illustrate the IS-As that underlie the area\u2019s child-of relationships. There are over 50 concepts in {specimen substance \u2217}, all of which share that single relationship. Similarly, all four concepts in {specimen substance +, specimen source morphology} have the same structure comprising these two relationships. In fact, each area has a structurally uniform set of concepts. The child-of from {specimen source morphology \u2217} to the top-level area \u2205 is due to the IS-A from the root Lesion sample to General biological sample. The IS-A relationships from Liquid material specimen to Inanimate samples and substances, and from Fluid sample to General biological sample are responsible for the child-of from {specimen substance \u2217} to \u2205. Since an area taxonomy is a high-level abstraction of the actual hierarchy, some information is naturally not displayed. For instance, in Fig. 4, there is no indication of whether a particular area is multi-rooted or not. More specific information is shown in the next level taxonomy. 3.4 P-areas and the p-area taxonomy 3.4.1 P-areas A natural solution to the semantic problems in the area taxonomy of Fig. 4 is to divide the area {r 1, r \u2217} into two constituent parts. Even though the roots X and Y introduce the same kind of relationship r, they each represent a unique semantics given that the targets of their r relationships are in different areas. Furthermore, each of the two roots, being a generalization of its descendants, captures their overarching semantics. Thus, X and its descendants in the area {r 1, r \u2217} can be seen as a unique semantic grouping. The same is true of Y and its descendants in this area. We define such a grouping as a partial area (p-area, for short). While such a multi-rooted area is named after its relationship(s), each p-area can be named after its unique root. The root X and its descendants form one p-area X, while Y and its descendants form another p-area Y. The area {r 1, r \u2217} contains both p-areas X and Y. It is important to note that while the p-areas form a semantic division of an area, they do not necessarily constitute a partition of the area. In particular, a concept, say, O in {r 1, r \u2217} might be a descendant of both X and Y. In such a case, O would be in both p-areas X and Y. Formally, the collection of p-areas of an area is thus a cover [41] and not a partition. This second level of division of areas into p-areas induces a second-level p-area taxonomy. The p-areas themselves are defined as nodes, and each area is displayed as a collection of p-area nodes within an area node that is named after the relationship(s). In a p-area taxonomy, we use a dashed (instead of solid) rectangle to stand for an area, indicating that it comprises p-areas. For consistency, we define the notion of p-area for singly rooted areas as well, although in such a case it contains all (not part of) the concepts in the area. The hierarchical child-of relationship in the p-area taxonomy is defined similarly to the one in an area taxonomy. That is, if there is an IS-A from the root of a p-area P 1 to a concept (not necessarily a root) of a p-area P 2, then in the p-area taxonomy there is a child-of hierarchical relationship from node P 1 to node P 2. Note that this IS-A needs to be from the root of the p-area P 1 to guarantee that each of the concepts of P 1 is a descendent of the root of P 2 and inherits its relationships as symbolized by P 1 child-of P 2. However, this purpose is achieved even if this IS-A\u2019s target is any concept of P 2, as such a concept itself is a descendent of the root of P 2 and inherits its relationships. In the case where all the p-areas of an area {Q} are child-of the same p-area P, we may, in order to prevent clutter, draw one hierarchical arrow from the boundary of {Q} to P. This also pertains, as a special case, to areas with a single p-area. Fig. 6 shows the p-area taxonomy for the terminology fragment of Fig. 3, including five different areas (the same as in Fig. 4). P-areas, named after their roots, are arrayed inside the area nodes. The area {r 1, r \u2217} contains the two p-areas X and Y. All other areas are singly rooted and thus contain only one p-area: A, B, Z, and W, respectively. The child-of relationship from the area node {r 1, r \u2217} to the p-area node A indicates that both p-areas X and Y are child-of the p-area A. Note that each p-area is singly rooted. As discussed in Section 3.1, it is paramount that the units of a division be singly-rooted if they are to yield nodes which make a view readily comprehensible. The single root of a p-area provides one uppermost generalized concept of which all other concepts in the group are descendants. The comprehensibility of a p-area taxonomy stems from the fact that each one of the concepts in the p-area is a specialization of the unique root. Due to this, the root functions as an effective designation for an aspect of the semantics: all things in the group are \u201cspecializations of the root.\u201d The root itself can be a representative of the entire collection, capturing its general category, and thus in the p-area taxonomy we name the corresponding p-area after the root. Similar to the area schema discussed in Section 3.1, we may define relationships among p-areas and create the p-area schema. However, we made the choice of avoiding those relationships and prefer the framework of a p-area taxonomy. There are several reasons for this choice. The first is that for our purpose of auditing, the p-area taxonomy is sufficient. The other reason is that a potential p-area schema will be so overwhelming in its size and complexity [26] that it will not properly promote comprehension of a terminology. In Section 4, we will see that the number of p-areas for a sample hierarchy of SNOMED is an order of magnitude higher than the number of its areas. Furthermore, the target p-areas of relationships of a p-area of one SNOMED hierarchy are typically in another hierarchy. Thus, a p-area schema will not be constrained within one hierarchy. Thus it will be very difficult to graphically display a p-area schema and comprehend all its parts. By keeping only the names of the relationships listed once in an area node and not repeated in its multiple p-area nodes, we are providing a much more compact view of the relationships of the p-areas. Since all p-areas in an area share the same structure, we do not need to make the structure part of the display of each p-area. At the same time, for the purpose of auditing, displaying just the names of the relationships of a p-area without the targets will be sufficient for highlighting most of the irregular or missing concepts of a p-area. Thus, the decision to use a p-area taxonomy rather than a p-area schema seems to be both practical and functional for the purpose of auditing. When needed, an auditor can review the targets of relationships of concepts by accessing the terminology itself. 3.4.2 Regions Another complication that can arise due to multiple introduction points for the same relationship is demonstrated by the terminology fragment in Fig. 7 . There we see that the concept H introduces the relationship r 6, while it inherits the relationship r 5 from its parent F. As such, H is the root of an area, which by the convention in Section 3.3 would be denoted {r 5, r 6 \u2217 }. (To simplify the discussion, we assume that r 5 is the only relationship exhibited by F. So, F\u2019s area is { r 5 \u2217 } .) However, this name is not accurate in this context. The concept I also has the relationships r 5 and r 6, but it introduces r 5 while inheriting r 6 from G. Therefore, with respect to the root I, the area should be named { r 5 \u2217 , r 6}. There are also problems concerning the child-of relationships of this area. The IS-A between H and F induces a child-of from H\u2019s area to { r 5 \u2217 } . A similar situation exists regarding the concepts I and G, with a child-of pointing to { r 6 \u2217 } . However, the area-taxonomy abstraction in this case gives an inaccurate picture of the status at the concept level. One would infer that all concepts in the area rooted at H and I would have ancestors in both areas { r 5 \u2217 } and { r 6 \u2217 } . But that is not even true for I and H. To deal with these issues, the p-area taxonomy is augmented with a division of the problematic area into separate obtainment-pattern regions (just regions for short). Each region is distinguished by the pattern in which its relationships are introduced and/or inherited, and each is named as if it were a separate area. But graphically all regions of a single area are drawn within the same box, with boundaries between regions drawn as dashed lines. Moreover, for an area with multiple regions, we define the child-of\u2019s directly from the regions instead of from the area as a whole. An example can be seen in Fig. 8 . We note that the combination of two relationships, such as r 5 and r 6, leads to the possibility of four different regions. In Fig. 9 , we show all four possible patterns of relationship obtainment with respect to r 5 and r 6. The two additional patterns yield the other two possible regions: { r 5 \u2217 , r 6 \u2217 } and {r 5, r 6}. The former is a strict introduction region. The latter is a strict inheritance region, previously referred to as an intersection area [8,18]. Such strict inheritance regions play an important role in our auditing methodology, as will be discussed below. If a region is neither a strict introduction region nor a strict inheritance region, such as the two regions in Fig. 8, we refer to it as a mixed region. The p-area taxonomy for Fig. 9 can be seen in Fig. 10 . Notice that the region {r 5, r 6} is a child of two p-areas residing in different areas. Strict inheritance regions always have multiple parents. They are also distinguished by the absence of \u201c\u2217\u201d from their names. It will be noted that in an area taxonomy we do not display areas down to the level of regions. However, when an area exhibits multiple patterns of obtainment with respect to a given relationship, say, r, then we use r + in its name. For example, Fig. 11 shows the area taxonomy of Fig. 9, where the area involving r 5 and r 6 is marked as { r 5 + , r 6 + } . As we will discuss below, this notation is useful in the auditing process. For convenience, in the following discussion, we will refer to areas containing only a strict inheritance region as \u201cstrict inheritance areas,\u201d while referring to p-areas of strict inheritance regions as \u201cstrict inheritance p-areas.\u201d 3.4.3 An illustrating example In Fig. 12 , we present the p-area taxonomy excerpt corresponding to the area taxonomy excerpt of Fig. 5. In this figure, the p-areas appear as solid-line boxes inside their respective areas, now drawn as dashed-line boxes. Inside the box of a p-area, its name, derived from its unique root, and its number of concepts (in parentheses) are listed. For example, the area \u2205 has only one p-area Specimen containing 30 concepts. The thick arrows stand for the child-of relationships between p-areas. For example, the p-area Fluid sample (9) is a child-of Specimen (30). In the case of multiple obtainment patterns within one area (indicated by a \u201c+\u201d following the appropriate relationships in the area\u2019s name), the area is divided into several regions, each with a disambiguated name. For example, the area {specimen source morphology, specimen substance +} in Fig. 5 is divided into two regions in the p-area taxonomy of Fig. 12: {specimen source morphology, specimen substance} and {specimen source morphology, specimen substance \u2217}. The strict inheritance region on the left contains two p-areas, Blister fluid sample (1) and Vesicle fluid sample (1), both of which do not introduce any relationship. Instead, both inherit specimen substance from Fluid sample and specimen morphology from Lesion sample, respectively. The p-area Biliary stone sample (2) in the right region introduces the relationship specimen substance while inheriting specimen source morphology from Lesion sample. Thus, an individual region exhibits a unique obtainment pattern and has p-areas whose child-of\u2019s capture their roots\u2019 parentage in other areas\u2019 p-areas. 3.5 Auditing methodologies The concept groupings and the taxonomy diagrams they induce can serve as the basis for efficient auditing by highlighting irregularities in the terminology. The two levels of taxonomy offer the auditor opportunities to detect irregularities of two kinds, structural and semantic, respectively. 3.5.1 Detecting structural irregularities in the area taxonomy In the area taxonomy, one could detect structural or hierarchical irregularities on the abstract level that may indicate errors on the concrete level. Generally, areas are arranged in levels according to their numbers of relationships. The number of levels depends on the total number of relationships defined for a hierarchy and the actual combinations. These relationships may combine with one another in any form. Combinatorially, n relationships may have up to 2 n different combinations, with n combinations on the first level, n 2 on the second level, etc. Comparing the actual number of areas on the lower levels with the theoretical bound can help to uncover potential errors. Missing relationship combinations in the levels with fewer relationships may be due to errors that occurred in the editing process. Areas on the first level are usually expected to have children in the area taxonomy, because relationships are presumably introduced in the lower levels and are inherited all the way through the hierarchy. Therefore, a first-level area {r \u2217} without any children is a noticeable irregularity, especially when the particular relationship r appears in higher levels of the hierarchy combined with other relationships. A natural question is: is this introduction pattern without further inheritance a reasonable one, and why does it exist? Similarly, a first-level area with very few children (e.g., one child) in the second level compared with other such areas may indicate an irregularity. We do not expect to encounter many concepts with a large number of relationships since such situations typically denote very complex concepts. If they were to be found, they would be at the higher levels of the area taxonomy. Of special interest in auditing are areas with a large number of relationships but very few concepts, since those concepts would have a complex and uncommon structure. 3.5.2 Detecting irregularities in the p-area taxonomy However, the area taxonomy itself is not sufficient to answer these questions because it only contains structural information. This is where the p-area taxonomy with its semantic knowledge comes in to support the auditing process. It presents a \u201cclose-up\u201d abstraction of the concept hierarchy, including information on regions and p-areas, identifying groups of concepts of uniform structure (relationships) and semantics (a unique generalizing root concept). 3.5.2.1 Areas with just a few small p-areas An area taxonomy also conveys the number of p-areas each area has. Using the area taxonomy, we can concentrate on areas with small numbers of p-areas. We would then further check the p-area taxonomy to see whether those few p-areas have a small number of concepts. In such a case, we have identified with this two-step process a p-area having a small number of concepts whose combination of relationships (from its area) and its semantics (represented by its root) both occur infrequently. A domain expert would review such a small group of concepts in the context provided by the two taxonomies. 3.5.2.2 Small p-areas with many relationships As mentioned in Section 3.5.1, it is recommended that an expert review the p-areas with a large number of relationships in the higher levels of the p-area taxonomy. Special attention should be given to such p-areas with only a few concepts. As mentioned before, the concepts of a small p-area with an infrequently occurring combination of relationships are highly suspicious. 3.5.2.3 Small, strict inheritance p-areas Multiple obtainment patterns (denoted using \u201c+\u201d notation) induce more than one region in an area. When looking into these regions, strict inheritance regions are of special interest in the auditing process. As a matter of fact, our experience [16] in auditing the MED has shown that hunting for errors among strict inheritance regions (referred to in [16] as \u201cintersection areas\u201d) can be extremely fruitful. Concepts in strict inheritance regions are more complex, as manifested not only by their compound nature but also by the multiple inheritance of relationships from different parents. Thus, we expect a higher likelihood of errors in strict inheritance regions than in other regions, especially when such a region contains only a few p-areas of small size. We expect errors such as mis-classifications, redundancies, omissions of concepts and relationships, incorrect synonyms, incorrect relationships and relationship targets, incomplete modeling, and modeling inconsistencies. 3.5.2.4 Compact view irregularities The p-area taxonomy provides a concept-oriented compact view of the content of an area. For example, the area {specimen substance} with its 51 concepts is summarized by the p-area taxonomy as just nine p-areas whose names indicate what kind of concepts are found in each. This compact view helps the auditor detect irregularities such as duplicate concepts and missing concepts. Such irregularities may be found strictly at the p-area level or in conjunction with the concept level. An example of a concept duplication observed strictly on the p-area level is the existence of the two p-areas Specimen from ear and Ear sample in the area {specimen source topography \u2217} (Fig. 15). Clearly, their roots are redundant. An example of a missing-concept irregularity observed in conjunction with the concept level occurs with the p-area Surgical excision sample which has only two concepts (Fig. 14). There are certainly more kinds of surgical excisions that should exist in this p-area besides the child concept Specimen obtained by radical excision. In this case, the p-area\u2019s number of concepts alerted us to these omissions. 3.5.3 Group-based auditing The current systematic quality-assurance methods used by the SNOMED editorial staff employ several different tools, notably, Apelon\u2019s TDE, the Clue browser [42], and Prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Most of the editing work is done using the TDE \u201ctree editor\u201d display that focuses on the relationships of one concept. This display shows the children of a concept, along with its defining relationships. When displaying multiple concepts and their interrelationships, the various tools currently employed all display a single folder-type view of a hierarchy, or minor variations such as the TDE\u2019s \u201cconcept walker.\u201d The concept walker displays the parents of a concept, as well as its children. Each of these can be expanded to display indented hierarchy views of the corresponding ancestor and descendant hierarchies. The efficient auditing methodologies we have previously developed [8,16,32] for large terminologies are based on partitions/divisions and their derived associated abstractions, which distill large networks of concepts down to more manageably sized networks. This distilling process divides the terminology into small groups of \u201csimilar concepts,\u201d as defined by a variety of criteria. In turn, reviewing such groups directs auditors toward identifying concepts that are clearly different from others in the group\u2014though they were presumed to be similar\u2014and are thus potentially in error in some way. Forming smaller groups of structurally and semantically similar concepts also enables the identification of \u201cmissing\u201d concepts, those which would naturally be expected to belong to a group but are currently absent. Such situations could arise because the concepts were omitted from the terminology originally (perhaps by mistake), or were mis-classified or misplaced in the IS-A hierarchy. As such, one can characterize our auditing methodologies as \u201cgroup-based\u201d auditing as opposed to the standard \u201cconcept-based\u201d approaches. We are presenting here an alternative approach to the interfaces currently used by the SNOMED editorial staff. According to the paradigm of area and p-area taxonomies, concepts are first grouped according to similar structure, and then as a secondary criterion, are grouped as descendants of a root concept. That is, concepts are grouped by areas and p-areas. Group-based auditing is organized around these groups instead of around individual concepts. Of course, specific concepts are the ultimate targets of auditing, but our approach offers a unique path for arriving at them. We believe that reviewing the concepts of a p-area as a group provides a context that helps in detecting errors that would not be exposed when each concept is reviewed separately. Besides the error of missing concepts, other kinds of errors that we expect to find in terminologies while reviewing uniform groups of concepts include: redundant concepts, incorrect IS-A arrangements, erroneous relationship configurations, and modeling errors. It will be noted that a p-area taxonomy provides an effective basis for group-based auditing. Moreover, the current auditing methodology fits the characterization of group-based auditing even more so than our previous methodologies. While the identified groups in [16] were structurally similar and those in [8,32] were semantically similar, a p-area is a group of concepts of both structural and semantic uniformity, and thus is an ideal unit for group-based auditing. 4 Results We will now demonstrate our techniques on an excerpt of SNOMED. The excerpt we have chosen, the Specimen hierarchy containing 1,056 concepts (as of the January 2004 release), gives a good illustration of the benefits of our methodology. 4.1 Area and p-area taxonomies for the Specimen hierarchy There are five relationships defined for concepts of the Specimen hierarchy: specimen substance, specimen source identity, specimen source topography, specimen source morphology, and specimen procedure. The area taxonomy derived for this hierarchy contains 19 areas, each named after its relationships, with the number of its p-areas appearing in parentheses (Fig. 13 ). For example, the area {specimen substance \u2217} has nine p-areas. The areas in Fig. 13 are displayed in color-coded levels according to the number of relationships defined for each. Note that the rightmost area {specimen substance \u2217, specimen procedure \u2217} on level 2 (area \u2205 is on level 0) is an area consisting of one strict introduction region. Another area where two relationships are introduced together is {specimen substance, specimen procedure \u2217, specimen source morphology \u2217} (leftmost on level 3), where only specimen substance is inherited from its parent area on level 1. Among these 19 areas, seven have multiple patterns of relationship obtainment. For instance, {specimen source topography +, specimen substance +} contains 19 p-areas of three different obtainment patterns. Detailed information about the obtainment patterns is shown in the p-area taxonomy that will be discussed below. The p-area taxonomy of the Specimen hierarchy is shown in a sequence of three figures, Figs. 14\u201316 . Due to the extent of some areas, we have omitted some p-areas from Fig. 14. They can be found in later figures. In particular, {specimen source topography \u2217} consisting of 33 p-areas is fully displayed in Fig. 15 . Similarly, {specimen source topography, specimen procedure +} with 42 p-areas is fully displayed in Fig. 16 . The number of concepts in a p-area appears in parentheses. For example, among the nine p-areas of {specimen substance \u2217}, the p-area Body fluid specimen contains eight concepts. The p-area taxonomy also presents the regions of the Specimen hierarchy\u2019s areas. An example with a complex obtainment pattern is shown in Fig. 15. The area {specimen source topography +, specimen substance +} contains 19 p-areas divided into three regions. Among them, two p-areas, Tears specimen and Peritoneal fluid specimen, inherit from {specimen substance \u2217} and introduce the other relationship specimen source topography. (We say a p-area introduces a relationship when its root does.) Another seven p-areas, including Breast fluid sample and Urological fluid sample, have the opposite inheritance pattern: they introduce specimen substance while inheriting from {specimen source topography \u2217}. The other 10 p-areas, e.g., Sweat specimen and Saliva specimen, are in a strict inheritance region. Another such complex area is {specimen substance, specimen procedure +, specimen source topography +} (Fig. 15), which also contains three regions. We give special attention to the strict inheritance regions because of their special importance to our auditing methodologies. The partitioning of the Specimen hierarchy yields nine strict inheritance regions, containing 27 p-areas and 83 concepts altogether. 4.2 Auditing using taxonomies With the area taxonomy and p-area taxonomy in place, we can demonstrate how to utilize them to uncover errors of various kinds. 4.2.1 Structural irregularities in Specimen area taxonomy Let us first consider the area taxonomy (Fig. 13) of the Specimen hierarchy of SNOMED. Theoretically, with five relationships, the child-of hierarchy could be as deep as five levels. The actual taxonomy turns out to have areas with at most three relationships. That is, the most complex specimen concepts have no more than three relationships. All five relationships are represented in the first-level areas, and each area has children on level 2. Among the five first-level areas, only two, {specimen procedure \u2217} and {specimen source identity \u2217}, have just a single child on level 2. According to our methodology, those situations are suspicious and need to be investigated. The other three first-level areas, {specimen source topography \u2217}, {specimen substance \u2217}, and {specimen source morphology \u2217}, have more children on level 2. The sole child of {specimen source identity \u2217} on level 2 is {specimen source topography +, specimen source identity}, containing two p-areas. The p-area taxonomy shows two regions (Fig. 14). The only p-area, Specimen from digestive system, in the region {specimen source identity, specimen source topography \u2217} contains 38 concepts denoting specimens from different parts of the digestive system, such as Specimen from stomach, Tissue specimen from liver, etc. While the introduction of specimen source topography is totally legitimate, the fact that it is a child of the p-area Specimen from patient, from which it inherits specimen source identity, is wrong. The root concept Specimen from digestive system should rather be a child of Specimen. Instead, Specimen from patient should have six other new concepts as its children, e.g., Blood bag specimen from patient, Leucocyte specimen from patient, and Serum specimen from patient. Thus, this structural irregularity leads to the discovery of a modeling error. It will be noted that following this study, this error has been corrected in the Jan. \u201905 release of SNOMED by removing the specimen source identity relationship from the root concept Specimen from digestive system. Thus, the p-area moves accordingly to the area {specimen source topography \u2217}. Furthermore, six new concepts were added as children of Specimen from patient. The only child of {specimen procedure \u2217} on level 2 is {specimen source topography, specimen procedure +}, with 42 p-areas. The p-area taxonomy shows two regions (Fig. 16). One region {specimen procedure \u2217, specimen source topography} of 39 p-areas introduces specimen procedure rather than inheriting it directly from the first level. A natural question is: why is this region not a child of {specimen procedure \u2217} instead? The 39 p-areas in this region are further reviewed. Each introduces the relationship specimen procedure connecting it with one of the three following procedures: biopsy, excision or resection, and swab (although the actual terms may be different when the procedure is applied to different body parts, e.g., the excision of breast is Mastectomy). Due to the difference in the names of the procedures, these subsumptions were probably not realized in the editing stage. Two of these three procedures appear at {specimen procedure \u2217} in the p-area taxonomy excerpt in Fig. 14. The concept Swab is in the hierarchy residing at \u2205 on level 0 and not in {specimen procedure \u2217} because of a missing-relationship error. Adding this relationship, Swab will move to the {specimen procedure \u2217} area. Therefore, in addition to their current parent p-areas in {specimen source topography \u2217}, these 39 p-areas should be children of one of the corresponding p-areas in {specimen procedure \u2217}. For example, Skin biopsy sample should be a child of Biopsy sample in addition to Tissue specimen. Likewise, Excised salivary gland sample and Resected lung sample should have another parent, Surgical excision sample. As a matter of fact, the Jan. \u201905 release of SNOMED confirmed these findings: 37 out of 39 p-areas appearing in {specimen source topography, specimen procedure \u2217} (Fig. 16) have been corrected to include one more parent p-area depicting the procedures. Although the SNOMED editorial team uncovered the errors using other editing tools, they serve to show the effectiveness of our auditing methodology. The only two p-areas left, Specimen from pleura obtained by thoracoscopic procedure and Specimen from thymus gland obtained by thoracotomy, do not correspond to any specific procedure in {specimen procedure \u2217}, and thus will remain in this region. After this correction, 37 out of 39 p-areas move to the strict inheritance region {specimen procedure, specimen source topography}, joining three other p-areas that were there before. As we see, the irregularity of two first-level areas having just one child on level 2 led to the discovery of these errors. 4.2.2 Irregularities in the Specimen p-area taxonomy 4.2.2.1 Areas with just a few small p-areas Special attention is also given to areas/regions with small numbers of p-areas. There are 10 regions having only one p-area in the p-area taxonomy (Figs. 14\u201316). One problematic p-area, Specimen from digestive system, with 38 concepts has been previously identified by its structural irregularity. Among these 10 regions, seven of them (four on the second level and three on the third) consist of a single p-area with three concepts or less. These \u201csmall\u201d p-areas are deemed highly suspicious according to our auditing guidelines. In fact, after review of the p-area taxonomy and the actual concepts, we found three such p-areas having confirmed errors. For example, the p-area Skin lesion sample in the region {specimen source topography, specimen source morphology \u2217} (Fig. 14) has only one concept. In addition to its current parent p-area, Tissue specimen, it should also have the parent Lesion sample in the area {specimen source morphology \u2217}. Thus, this region disappears and the p-area joins the three other p-areas in the strict inheritance region of the same area. Another example is the p-area rooted at Biliary stone sample with two concepts (Fig. 14), which should not inherit specimen source morphology from Lesion sample. In this case, the p-area moves to the area {specimen substance \u2217}, and the region {specimen source morphology, specimen substance \u2217} disappears as a result of the removal of the relationship specimen source morphology. 4.2.2.2 Small p-areas with many relationships The relationship combinations get more complex on the third level. A review of the third-level p-areas reveals more errors. One area, {specimen source identity, specimen source topography, specimen source morphology \u2217}, contains only one p-area, Colonic polyp sample (Fig. 14), which includes only two concepts. It is obvious that the relationship specimen source identity is irrelevant in this context. As we pointed out previously, this area\u2019s parent {specimen source identity, specimen source topography \u2217} inherits an incorrect relationship specimen source identity, and this error propagates via the subsumption hierarchy to its descendants. In fact, another third-level area, {specimen source identity, specimen source topography, specimen procedure +}, has the same error due to this problematic parent. After removing the incorrect relationship specimen source identity, these two areas disappear and their p-areas move accordingly to some second-level areas. 4.2.2.3 Small, strict inheritance p-areas Our auditing methodology pays special attention to concepts of strict inheritance regions and especially to their small p-areas. The root concept of the p-area Specimen obtained by fine needle aspiration procedure (Fig. 16) in the strict inheritance region {specimen procedure, specimen source topography} has only one child, Fine needle aspirate of thyroid, cytologic material. This is thus a small p-area of a strict inheritance region with few p-areas. Other specimens obtained by the same procedure are missing from SNOMED, demonstrating the incompleteness of the modeling. This is another example where the compact view of the p-area taxonomy exposes irregularities on the concept level. All concepts of such small p-areas warrant close inspections, not just the roots. For example, the p-area Specimen from gastrointestinal tract obtained by incisional biopsy in the strict inheritance region {specimen source identity, specimen source topography, specimen procedure} (Fig. 16) has only two concepts. Its child concept Specimen from stomach obtained by incisional biopsy has a relationship specimen source topography connecting it with the wrong target, Large intestinal structure. Another error was revealed when reviewing the singleton p-area Specimen from lung obtained by fine needle aspiration procedure in the strict inheritance region {specimen procedure, specimen source topography, specimen substance} (Fig. 15). The root concept should have Specimen obtained by fine needle aspiration procedure as a parent instead of Specimen from lung obtained by biopsy. Respiratory fluid specimen in the strict inheritance region {specimen source topography, specimen substance} (Fig. 15) has Upper respiratory sample as one of its parents. Apparently, Respiratory fluid specimen could be from either the upper or lower respiratory tracts. The fact that all its children are fluid samples from upper respiratory tract (Fig. 18) made us wonder whether the correct concept here should be Upper respiratory fluid sample, which was mistakenly defined as a synonym of Respiratory fluid specimen in SNOMED. 4.2.2.4 Compact view irregularities As mentioned in Section 3.5.2, the compact view of the concepts in an area provided by a p-area taxonomy can help expose irregularities. For example, a p-area Female genital fluid specimen is in the region {specimen source topography, specimen substance \u2217} (Fig. 15), but its potential counterpart Male genital fluid specimen is missing from SNOMED. Such an omission is observed due to the view of just seven p-areas in the region containing 36 concepts. Furthermore, the review of these seven p-areas reveals that all consist of body fluid sample concepts, and their roots, including Breast fluid sample and Urological fluid sample, should therefore have IS-As to Body fluid specimen, the root (and name) of a p-area observed in the review of {specimen substance \u2217} (Fig. 14). Due to these new IS-As, the relationship specimen substance of all these p-areas will be inherited rather than introduced, and the whole region will disappear because its p-areas will move to the strict inheritance region {specimen source topography, specimen substance}. Moreover, when the above mentioned area {specimen substance \u2217} is reviewed in the context of the p-area taxonomy, it is observed that Body fluid specimen itself should be a child of both Fluid sample, the root of its p-area in {specimen substance \u2217} (Fig. 14), and Body substance sample, a root of another p-area in that same area. But when one tries to add Body fluid specimen as a child of Body substance sample, it becomes apparent that there is already a child Body fluid sample. This is an example of two identical concepts, one of which should be a synonym of the other, instead. The reason for such an error is that the term \u201cspecimen\u201d was used previously in SNOMED RT, and \u201csample\u201d was used in CTV3. Such redundancy errors occurred as a result of the integration process. The incorrect subsumption relationships among Fluid sample, Body fluid sample, and Body fluid specimen lead to other errors in the strict inheritance regions. For example, there are redundant IS-A links if concepts have both Fluid sample and Body fluid sample/specimen as their parents. The roots Saliva specimen, Sweat specimen, and Seminal fluid specimen of their respective small p-areas in the strict inheritance region {specimen source topography, specimen substance} (Fig. 15) should not be, as a consequence, children of Fluid sample, just of Body fluid specimen. When reviewing some larger p-areas in that region, we found some other roots, such as Respiratory fluid specimen and Saliva specimen, that should also not have Fluid sample as a parent. 4.3 Group-based auditing To demonstrate such group-based auditing, we consider the part of the Specimen hierarchy that includes Body fluid specimen and all its 70 descendants. In the structural analysis displayed by our p-area taxonomy (Fig. 14), the p-area rooted at Body fluid specimen contains only eight concepts. Hence, the other 63 descendants have a different structure and thus appear in a different area. Figs. 17 and 18 present the same 71 concepts in a different way: in an indented format as in the SNOMED CLUE browser [42]. The concepts are grouped into p-areas of different regions. Fig. 18 shows only the concepts that are in the strict inheritance regions; the other descendants of Body fluid specimen are shown in Fig. 17. For completeness, we show all concepts in every p-area, but only the descendants of Body fluid specimen are shown in black; others are in blue. The indented hierarchy display of SNOMED CLUE can be used to support review of groups, such as a concept together with all its children (e.g., Urine specimen and its nine children), or a concept and all its descendants (e.g., Sputum specimen). However, these groups have some deficiencies. Although such a group is cohesive due to its unique root, the structures of its concepts are not necessarily the same. For instance, neither Catheter specimen nor Urinary catheter specimen, both children of Urine specimen, has the same structure as its parent. Furthermore, concepts may have other parents that appear in a different location and are not seen in the tree representation. For example, in addition to the parent Body fluid specimen, Urine specimen has the parent Urological fluid sample, appearing in another part of the Specimen hierarchy. Similarly, Catheter specimen has the parent Device specimen, in addition to Urine specimen. Figs. 17 and 18 break down the hierarchy into multiple p-areas and go down to the concept level, thus providing us with a more refined view of the p-area taxonomy. As mentioned previously, the typically small groups of concepts of a p-area are uniform both structurally and semantically. In addition, the p-area taxonomies reflect the multiple parents of a p-area if they exist (especially for the p-areas in the strict inheritance regions). Hence, review of concept groups of p-areas is more promising for the purpose of auditing than review of the indented tree representation. The errors we report here were exposed while reviewing such groups. For instance, when reviewing the p-area Respiratory fluid specimen in the strict inheritance region {specimen substance, specimen source topography} (Fig. 18), we noticed two concepts, Nasopharyngeal washings and Oropharyngeal aspirate, and realized that a related concept expected in this group, Nasopharyngeal aspirate, was missing. In fact, Nasopharyngeal aspirate, a child of Respiratory fluid specimen, appears in a separate singleton p-area in another area {specimen substance, specimen source topography, specimen procedure \u2217} (Fig. 17). This leads to our discovery of a \u201cmissing relationship\u201d error: seven concepts from this Respiratory fluid specimen p-area, such as Nasopharyngeal washings, Sinus washings, etc., should have one more relationship, specimen procedure, just like two of their siblings, Nasopharyngeal aspirate and Transtracheal aspirate sample. Reviewing a group of concepts that is structurally and semantically uniform, as with a p-area, helps to uncover irregularities. For example, the p-area Body fluid specimen contains the two concepts Cerebrospinal fluid sample and Cerebrospinal fluid specimen, which are identical. In another example, the p-area Peritoneal fluid specimen is a child of the p-area Body fluid specimen, but the latter contains a concept, Peritoneal fluid sample, identical to the root of the former. When the p-area Gastrointestinal fluid sample is reviewed, it is observed that Gastric washings is missing the relationship specimen procedure. Such examples demonstrate the power of group-based auditing in exposing irregularities in groups that are supposed to be uniform. Such irregularities may indicate errors that would not otherwise have been detected without the group context. Altogether we found 54 errors of different kinds using the auditing methodologies reported in this paper. These errors were reviewed by one of the authors (KAS) who is the Scientific Director of SNOMED. All but four of the errors were confirmed and corrected in the Jan. \u201905 release of SNOMED. 5 Discussion 5.1 Interpretation In summary, auditing using the two-level taxonomies can be very fruitful. The area and p-area taxonomies provide the auditor abstract views of different granularities, thus prompting the auditor to view the hierarchy first structurally and later semantically. Consequently, the taxonomies help to detect irregularities, which leads to the identification of potential errors. The development of area and p-area taxonomies described above is of more than theoretical interest. Maintenance personnel face great challenges when trying to keep a terminology relatively error-free. A thorough understanding of the general structure of a terminology is imperative. On the other hand, an understanding of every last concept in a large terminology is impractical. Our taxonomies aptly fulfill this need by providing a high-level abstract view of the terminology. The compact two-level taxonomy enables better navigation and orientation into the content and structure of a terminology. When we previously applied a related object-oriented methodology to the MED [16,17], the schema we obtained was 500 times smaller than the original concept network. It thus compactly revealed the gestalt of the terminology and allowed its designers to see it in a brand new perspective. J.J. Cimino, the designer of the MED stated \u201cThe schema captures the essence of the MED while ignoring its minutiae.\u201d 2 J.J. Cimino, personal communication. 2 In addition, the construction of the schema led to the discovery of some errors and inconsistencies that would otherwise have gone undetected. As we see in the example of the Specimen hierarchy, we encounter a similar phenomenon for the two-level area taxonomy. For a hierarchy of 1056 concepts we obtained 19 areas and 164 p-areas. Together the two levels, taken in parts, provide a compact view of the structure and content of this hierarchy. For example, looking at the p-area taxonomy in Fig. 14, one sees several groups of concepts with the same specimen substance relationship structure, such as Body fluid specimen (8), Body substance sample (11), Milk specimen (9) and Fluid sample (9) as well as few smaller groups. Looking at these p-areas, one obtains a good comprehension of the concepts with such a relationship. The primary partition into areas helps the orientation by providing structurally similar groups of small to medium numbers of p-areas. It has often proved to be the case that when new vocabularies are integrated into the UMLS, the developers of that vocabulary have seen opportunities for improvement as a result of the mapping process, e.g., when the Gene Ontology (GO) was integrated into the UMLS [43]. Likewise, the UMLS developers have seen room for improvement and enhancement. When SNOMED CT was integrated into the UMLS, errors in 800 concepts, about 0.25% of all concepts of SNOMED CT, were uncovered. In other words, integration of one terminology into another has also a side effect in terms of auditing. However, the percentage of errors found is much lower than when we applied our techniques to the sample of the Specimen hierarchy. General quality-assurance techniques employed by SNOMED involve direct inspection of the hierarchies, inspection of the stated and inferred forms of the description logic definitions of individual concepts, and inspection of the hierarchy changes that result from changes in definitions. The focus of the effort is identified by reports of needed corrections that come from multiple parties, including end users of the terminology. In particular, within the Specimen hierarchy, many needed changes were identified as a direct result of feedback from the research described here. Identification of the same errors also occurred independently through inspection of the concepts by the editors. We do not have specific data that would compare the effort involved in the two different auditing processes. 5.2 Limitations Our auditing methodologies are based on abstraction networks that require systematic inheritance of relationships (via the terminology\u2019s IS-A hierarchy) for their derivation. They are, therefore, applicable to a number of terminologies exhibiting this behavior, including: SNOMED; the Veteran Administration\u2019s Enterprise Reference Terminology (ERT) [44]; Kaiser\u2019s Convergent Medical Terminology (CMT) [45] (the preceding two based on SNOMED); NCIT [38]; FMA [46]; RxNorm [47]; MED [19]; and the Vocabulary Server (VOSER) terminology [48] (the basis for the 3M Healthcare Data Dictionary [49]). While the list of such qualifying terminologies is not overly extensive, it comprises many that are very important and widely used. Moreover, we foresee many emerging terminologies being of this ilk and therefore being amenable to our methodologies. In fact, the design of SNOMED anticipates the need for extensions and subsets in order to craft terminological artifacts that are tuned to the needs of individual hospitals as well as groups of organizations of all sizes. SNOMED International\u2019s \u201creference set specification\u201d [50] serves the purpose of extracting components of SNOMED tailored to particular organizational preferences and use-cases. Thus, SNOMED itself is in an ideal position to be the progenitor of a whole family of new terminologies. Because our methodologies group concepts based on their structure, an auditor may be preferentially directed to review concepts whose structure stands out as being exceptional. This is not necessarily a problem as structural similarity tends to parallel semantic similarity, and semantic errors are liable to be discovered in this manner. However, our methodologies will not readily reveal errors of a semantic nature for concepts whose structure is not particularly exceptional. Our taxonomy derivation and auditing methodology were successfully applied to one small hierarchy of SNOMED, the Specimen hierarchy. However, other hierarchies may potentially yield different results. For example, hierarchies with low numbers of concepts having multiple parents, such as SNOMED\u2019s Event, Staging and Scales hierarchy or its Dependent Categories hierarchy, will probably have no strict inheritance regions where our methodology can focus the search for errors. Some hierarchies have a high or low number of relationships that will influence the number of levels of the taxonomies. A more extensive investigation of larger SNOMED hierarchies is needed to further substantiate and refine our auditing methodology. 6 Conclusion Terminologies, such as SNOMED, have attained an important position in the medical information domain, underlying applications from decision-support systems to clinical patient record processing. As such, it is critical that the conceptual content of terminologies be kept as accurate and up-to-date as possible. Thus, auditing plays a major role in their maintenance. We have developed systematic auditing methodologies based on the notion of abstraction networks that afford high-level contextual views of a terminology. In particular, we presented two kinds of abstraction networks, area taxonomies and p-area taxonomies, each of which is based on a division of the underlying terminology and is derivable via algorithmic means. We have shown that various kinds of errors tend to manifest themselves as irregularities at the level of the taxonomies. Thus, the taxonomies\u2014orders of magnitude smaller in size than the terminology itself\u2014can be used as efficient means of discovering errors. The p-area taxonomy also supports group-based auditing, where sets of purportedly similar concepts are reviewed together in their respective contexts. We have applied our methodologies to the Specimen hierarchy of SNOMED, leading to the discovery of a variety of errors and their subsequent correction. Even though SNOMED was our sole test-bed in this work, our methodologies have been formulated abstractly and can easily be applied to other terminologies that utilize a knowledge model similar to that of SNOMED. However, experimentation with other SNOMED hierarchies and other terminologies is needed to further substantiate these findings.

Glossary \u2217 (asterisk) When adorning a relationship r in an area name, indicates that r is introduced by all the roots of the area. In a relationship obtainment pattern, indicates that the relationship is introduced by the particular concept. Cf. \u201c+\u201d (plus sign) and region. + (plus sign) When adorning a relationship r in an area name, indicates that r is introduced by a root(s) of the area and inherited by another root(s). In such a case, the area will comprise multiple regions. Cf. \u201c\u2217\u201d (asterisk) and relationship obtainment pattern. Area A set of all concepts having the exact same set of relationships (or structure). Area taxonomy A directed acyclic graph (DAG), derived from a terminology, consisting of nodes that are the terminology\u2019s areas and links called child-of relationships that abstract the underlying IS-As of the terminology. Overall, it captures the relationships exhibited by the terminology\u2019s various areas and the ways in which those relationships are obtained. Cf. schema. Child-of relationship A hierarchical link in an area taxonomy connecting one node (area) to another. A child-of relationship between a node B and a node A conveys the fact that a root of B has an IS-A link to some concept in A. In a p-area taxonomy, a child-of connects two p-areas. Introducing concept A concept exhibiting at least one relationship, say, r not exhibited by any of its parent concepts. The concept is said to introduce r. Mixed region A region that is neither a strict inheritance region nor a strict introduction region. Multi-rooted area An area having more than one root. Partial area (p-area) A subcollection of an area consisting of one root together with all the root\u2019s descendants in the area. P-area taxonomy A DAG, derived from a terminology, consisting of two-level (area/p-area) nodes and child-of relationship links. Each node is an area containing subnodes that are the area\u2019s p-areas. The child-of relationships connect p-areas to other p-areas. A p-area taxonomy extends an area taxonomy to include additional information about the hierarchical grouping of concepts. Partition (of a terminology) A collection of disjoint sets whose union constitutes the entire terminology. Region Also calledobtainment-pattern region. A collection of p-areas (of a given area) whose roots all have the exact same relationship obtainment pattern. The region is named after that pattern. Relationship obtainment pattern A listing of all of a concept\u2019s relationships denoting the manner in which they are obtained. A given relationship can either be obtained via inheritance or introduced directly at a concept. (See introducing concept.) When writing relationship obtainment patterns, a \u201c\u2217\u201d is used to indicate a relationship that is introduced; an inherited relationship contains no adornment. Relationship obtainment patterns form the basis of regions and are used for their naming. Root (of an area) A concept of an area, say, A whose parents all reside in areas other than A. Every area must have at least one root. Schema Also called area schema. A network, derived from a terminology, consisting of nodes that are the terminology\u2019s areas and two kinds of links that abstract the underlying IS-As and (attribute) relationships of the terminology. A schema is used for a terminology that has unique introducing concepts for all relationships. Singly rooted area An area having exactly one root. Strict inheritance area An area consisting of only one region that is a strict inheritance region. Strict inheritance region A region whose concepts\u2019 relationships are obtained only via inheritance. There are no introducing concepts in such a region; thus, there are no \u2217\u2019s in the region\u2019s name. Strict inheritance p-area A p-area contained in a strict inheritance region. Strict introduction region A region whose p-areas\u2019 roots obtain their relationships only via introduction. The roots in such a region have no inherited relationships; thus, all the relationships in the region\u2019s name are adorned with \u2217\u2019s. Structure (of a concept) A concept\u2019s complete set of relationships, including those introduced and those inherited.", "scopus-id": "34548266126", "pubmed-id": "17276736", "coredata": {"eid": "1-s2.0-S1532046406001377", "dc:description": "Abstract SNOMED is one of the leading health care terminologies being used worldwide.
