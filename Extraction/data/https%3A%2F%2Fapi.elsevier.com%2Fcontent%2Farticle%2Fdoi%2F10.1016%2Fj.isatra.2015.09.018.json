A predictor-based neural dynamic surface control design method is presented to develop the distributed adaptive containment controllers, under which the trajectories of follower vehicles nearly converge to the dynamic convex hull spanned by multiple reference trajectories over a directed network. Prediction errors, rather than tracking errors, are used to update the neural adaptation laws, which are independent of the tracking error dynamics, resulting in two time-scales to govern the entire system. The stability property of the closed-loop network is established via Lyapunov analysis, and transient property is quantified in terms of L\n                     2 norms of the derivatives of neural weights, which are shown to be smaller than the classical neural dynamic surface control approach. Comparative studies are given to show the substantial improvements of the proposed new method.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Autonomous underwater vehicles"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Containment"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Dynamic surface control (DSC)"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Predictor"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Neural networks"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019057815002323", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019057815002323", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84947601283", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84947601283", "pubmed-id": "26506019", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84947601283", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20151023", "$": "2015-10-23"}}}}}
