One approach for facilitating protein function prediction is to classify proteins into functional families from primary sequence. Being the most important group of all proteins, the accurate prediction for enzyme family classes and subfamily classes is closely related to their biological functions. In this paper, for the prediction of enzyme subfamily classes, the Chou's amphiphilic pseudo-amino acid composition [Chou, K.C., 2005. Using amphiphilic pseudo amino acid composition to predict enzyme subfamily classes. Bioinformatics 21, 10\u201319] has been adopted to represent the protein samples for training the \u2018one-versus-rest\u2019 support vector machine. As a demonstration, the jackknife test was performed on the dataset that contains 2640 oxidoreductase sequences classified into 16 subfamily classes [Chou, K.C., Elrod, D.W., 2003. Prediction of enzyme family classes. J. Proteome Res. 2, 183\u2013190]. The overall accuracy thus obtained was 80.87%. The significant enhancement in the accuracy indicates that the current method might play a complementary role to the exiting methods.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Enzyme subfamily classes prediction"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Support vector machine"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Amphiphilic pseudo-amino acid composition"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519307002809", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519307002809", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "34548439881", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-34548439881", "pubmed-id": "17628605", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34548439881", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20070609", "$": "2007-06-09"}}}}}
