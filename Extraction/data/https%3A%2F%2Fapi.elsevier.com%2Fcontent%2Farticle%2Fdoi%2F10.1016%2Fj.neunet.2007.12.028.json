The reduced multivariate model (RM) is a recently proposed classifier model which is easy to implement and analyze, and has been observed to efficiently capture the nonlinear input\u2013output relationships in many classification applications. Since the freeway incident detection can be treated as a two-category pattern classification problem, the reduced multivariate polynomial model is particularly suitable for this incident detection application. Both Recursive Singular Value Decomposition (RSVD)- based and gradient descent-based least square estimators were adopted to learn the RM classifier in this work. The comparison of results obtained with those from several other classification strategies demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed model for traffic incident detection.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Reduced multivariate polynomial model"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Least square estimator"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Singular value decomposition"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608007002651", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608007002651", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "40649118931", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-40649118931", "pubmed-id": "18276107", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/40649118931", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20071227", "$": "2007-12-27"}}}}}
