We evaluate Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) and several other network architectures on the benchmark task of framewise phoneme classification, using the TIMIT database. Our main findings are that bidirectional networks outperform unidirectional ones, and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is much faster and also more accurate than both standard Recurrent Neural Nets (RNNs) and time-windowed Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). Our results support the view that contextual information is crucial to speech processing, and suggest that BLSTM is an effective architecture with which to exploit it.\n                        1\n                     \n                     \n                        1\n                        An abbreviated version of some portions of this article appeared in (Graves and Schmidhuber, 2005), as part of the IJCNN 2005 conference proceedings, published under the IEEE copyright.\n                     \n                  \n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608005001206", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608005001206", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "27744588611", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-27744588611", "pubmed-id": "16112549", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/27744588611", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20050819", "$": "2005-08-19"}}}}}
