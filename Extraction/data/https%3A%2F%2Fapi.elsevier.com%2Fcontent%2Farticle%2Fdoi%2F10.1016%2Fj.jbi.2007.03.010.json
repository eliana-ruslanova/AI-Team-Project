Abstract Visualization can largely improve biomedical data analysis. It plays a crucial role in explorative data analysis and may support various data mining tasks. The paper presents FreeViz, an optimization method that finds linear projection and associated scatterplot that best separates instances of different class. In a single graph, the resulting FreeViz visualization can provide a global view of the classification problem being studied, reveal interesting relations between classes and features, uncover feature interactions, and provide information about intra-class similarities. The paper gives mathematical foundations of FreeViz, and presents its utility on various biomedical data sets. Keywords Explorative data analysis Multivariate visualization Intelligent visualisation Projection search for supervised data 1 Introduction Biomedical data analysis may significantly benefit from visualization. The right visualization may uncover important relationships in the data and present them in the format that supports and encourages interpretation. In the paper, we are concerned with the use of data visualization in predictive data mining, where each data instance (case) is described with a set of features (predictive variables) and labelled with a class (e.g. outcome, diagnosis). Multivariate visualization is often one of the tools used in biomedical data mining, and may provide a starting point in explorative analysis. When considering data sets with many features, the principal problem to solve is which features to visualize and how to combine them in the visualization. Data may include several tens, hundreds or even thousands of features, while in visual presentations we are limited to two or three dimensions. To visualize such data, we therefore have to find an appropriate projection, that is, a transformation of data points from many-dimensional to two- or three-dimensional space. With the increasing number of features, any manual search for good projections becomes unfeasible. The procedure thus requires some automatic means of finding good projections that would optimize some criteria of quality or interestingness, that is, would result in visualization that exposes any inherent structure in the data. Finding an appropriate data mapping or projection is in fact a traditional approach in examining multi-varied data [1]. For classless (unsupervised) data, a viable and popular technique that addresses this problem is the projection pursuit, which finds a linear combination of features so that projected data exhibits structure, such as clusters and surfaces [2]. Interestingly, supervised data mining techniques for finding interesting projections for data display are at best rare, although the task is somehow better defined: interesting visualization is one that well separates data instances of different classes. We are aware of two approaches in this category that both use radial visualization (RadViz) [3] that features a transformation allowing to simultaneously display more than two features in a single point-based planar graph. The first is McCarthy\u2019s [4] variant of RadViz that places correlated features close to each other and in this way tries to improve on class separation, and the other is Leban\u2019s Vizrank [5,6] that directly optimizes class separation and uses the heuristic search through projection space. The paper presents the algorithm called FreeViz that optimizes a linear projection and displays the projected data in a scatterplot. The target projection is found through a gradient optimization approach and aims at separating the instances of different classes in class-labelled data. The procedure often results in very informative projections that are prone to simple interpretation. FreeViz can handle large data sets in matter of seconds, and can be further used for feature subset selection and feature interaction discovery. Let us introduce FreeViz on a simple example. In this, we considered zoology data set from UCI Machine Learning repository [7]. The set includes data on 101 animals described by 15 binary (lays eggs, breathes, has hair, \u2026) and one six-valued feature (the number of legs). The animals are classified into seven groups (mammals, birds, reptiles, \u2026). Fig. 1 f shows a two-dimensional projection found by FreeViz. The visualization reveals several interesting findings about animals in the data, including: \u2022 having hair is strongly correlated with giving milk and somewhat less with having teeth, \u2022 having feathers, being airborne and laying eggs look correlated and are all a property of birds, \u2022 the above two groups of features are at the opposite sides, which, in interpretation, means that animals that give milk do not lay eggs or fly, \u2022 mammals typically give milk, and have hair and teeth; \u2022 similarly, there are aquatic animals called fish, which have fins, do not breath and have no legs, \u2022 there seem to be two groups of airborne animals, birds and insects; the former are the ones that lay eggs and have feathers \u2022 animal\u2019s domesticity, venomousness and size are not very informative. Not all of the above hypotheses stemming from interpretation of the FreeViz visualization are necessarily correct. For instance, in the above example, we wrongly concluded that the insects do not lay eggs. Neither does the picture show every relation there is in the data: the picture does not clearly suggest that animals having fins are not airborne, and having backbone is put close to the center which wrongly suggests this feature is not important in animal classification. These limitations are uncircumventable results of using a low dimensional projection. However, in explorative analysis, as it was our attempt with the above example, data visualizations are used only to hint at potential patterns and relations, in this way helping us to formulate working hypotheses, and are not meant to replace the statistical tools for (dis)proving them. The next section describes the mathematical foundation of FreeViz algorithm, and the interpretation and use of its results. We then use several cases to demonstrate the utility of FreeViz in biomedical data analysis, both on classical clinical data sets and on cancer gene expression data sets. Being on the crossroad of statistics, visualization and machine learning, FreeViz bears some similarity to various methods from these fields, which are discussed in the section on related work. Throughout the paper we shall use a convenient term \u201cprojection\u201d, although the presented method is in fact more general and optimizes arbitrary linear transformations into lower dimensional spaces. 2 Methods The search algorithm used in FreeViz is based on a metaphor from physics. After introducing the notation, we first work out the mathematics needed to simulate the physical process. This is followed by guidelines for interpreting projections and using them to make predictions. Let e be a data instance described by values of n continuous features, e =[e 1, e 2,\u2026, e n ]. To equivalently treat the discrete (non-continuous) features, these are replaced by corresponding continuous dummy variables. Each instance hence represents a point in n-dimensional feature space. Our algorithm will optimize the projection of the data set into two-dimensional space; the limit on the number of dimensions is imposed to match the limitations of graphical devices and human perception, not due to the mathematics of the algorithm. Let A be a projection matrix in which the row A i = [ A x i , A y i ] represents the projection of i-th base vector, that is, the x and y components of the vector corresponding to the i-th descriptive feature. The position of an instance e in the projection is computed as e x = \u2211 i e i A x i , e y = \u2211 i e i A y i or, in matrix notation, e\u2032= eA. 2.1 Optimization method The physical metaphor for the optimization procedure goes as follows. Imagine that each instance in the two dimensional space is a particle (we will use the terms instance and particle interchangeably from now on). As between the physical particles, our data instances will also exert forces on each other, with the strength depending on their distance and the direction of the force depending on the types of charges\u2014instances\u2019 classes. Instances of the same class will attract and instances of different classes will repel each other. The goal of optimization\u2014finding a good class separation\u2014then translates to finding the configuration (projection) with the minimal potential energy. Let F f\u2192e be the force acting on instance e due to instance f. When a particle e is moved by de\u2032, the work and the change of the potential energy equals dE = A =\u2212F f\u2192e de\u2032. In a system composed of multiple particles, the force acting on a particle equals the sum of forces exerted by all other particles, F e = \u2211 f \u2260 e F f \u2192 e and the change of potential energy when moving e is dE e =\u2212F e de\u2032. When multiple particles are moved at once (as they will be in our case), the change of the potential energy of the system equals the sum of changes, d E = - \u2211 e F e de \u2032 FreeViz uses gradient descent method to minimize the potential energy of the system. Since our particles can only be moved by moving the projections of the base vectors, we need to compute the gradient of the energy as a function of the projection. Consider that e\u2032= eA and so de\u2032= e dA. When projections of the base vector are moved, the change in the system\u2019s energy equals to d E = - \u2211 e F e ( e dA ) When moving the x-coordinate of the i-th vector, the related change in the energy is d E = - \u2211 e F e , x e i d A x i , where F e,x is the x-component of F e , so d E d A x i = - \u2211 e F e , x e i The computation for the y-coordinate is analogous. The formula is consistent with our intuition and with the principal laws in the nature which (at least on the grand scale) minimizes the potential energy by accelerating the objects in the direction opposite to the energy gradient, that is, in the direction of the force. Instances are attracted or repelled from each other, but since they are \u201cheld\u201d in their corresponding places by a particular projection defined through projections of the base vectors, the forces between the instances are transmitted to the vectors, moving them accordingly. The force acting on each particle (data instance) is distributed among the base vectors proportionally with the values of corresponding features, e i . The formula is independent of the definition of the force. Its sign should be determined by the class labels: if two instances are from the same class, the force between them is attractive, otherwise, it is repulsive. As for the distance, in our three dimensional space the usual large scale forces decrease by the inverse-square law, F \u223c1/r 2. In the two-dimensional world of FreeViz, the density of the field lines decreases linearly with the distance, so the force should be proportional to 1/r. On the other hand, we can borrow the idea of Gaussian kernels from the statistics and let the force be proportional to e - r 2 . After some initial testing we have decided to use inverse-linear law, although the differences between the methods were neither significant nor consistent. A more important consideration regarding the force is whether it needs to decrease or increase with the distance. When separating instances of different classes, we are most concerned with those that are close together, while we do not need to push the groups that are already well-separated further apart. The repulsive force must therefore fall with the distance. On the other hand, if the attractive force decreased with the distance (and thus increased with proximity), it would be manifested through squeezing the already well-defined groups of instances from the same class, while an instance far from other instances of its own class would not be attracted by them but rather pushed around by instances of other classes and thrown out in a random direction. The attractive force should therefore increase with the distance. In a sense, the repulsive forces act like the electromagnetic or gravitational forces which decrease with the distance, while the attractive forces resemble the strong force that binds quarks and which increases by the distance, like binding a pair of particles with a rubber band. 2.2 Implementation The algorithm for computation of gradients (Fig. 2 ) makes use of the action-reaction symmetry: the force between each pair of instances is computed only once and added to the sum of forces for both instances, but with different directions (F f\u2192e =\u2212F e\u2192f ). The force (F_ef) is separated into its x and y components (Fefx and Fefy) by multiplying it by projections to x and y axis, dx/r and dy/r, respectively. The algorithm is rather simple and relatively fast: its time complexity is O(N 2 + NA), where N is the number of instances and A the number of features; the first term comes from the computation of forces between particles and the second from the loop that distributes the forces acting on each instance between the base vectors. The operations performed by the algorithm are elementary; note that we can also easily avoid computing the square root in the above algorithm, as we did in our actual implementation. We did not encounter performance problems on any of our example sets, yet due to quadratic dependency on the number of data instances the algorithm may run observably slower on very large data sets. The computed gradients can be used for the gradient descent optimization. To keep the projection from exploding or imploding, we recenter and renormalize it after each step, so that the sum of all base vector projections is zero and the longest base vector is of unit length. The procedure is repeated until there is no considerable decrease (e.g. 1%) of the potential energy for few consecutive steps. Optimization by a gradient descent could be replaced with more advanced methods, but we found it fit for our purpose: it is fast and does not seem to have a tendency to stop in various local minima. Fig. 1 shows six snapshots of the optimization procedure on the zoology data. The optimization stopped after 150 steps and took only a split second. An important note about the algorithm is that it should not be used when the number of features exceeds the number of instances. Formally, if E is a matrix of instances and its rank equals the number of instances, the system EA = P has multiple solutions for any matrix of instances\u2019 positions P, so it is possible to find a projection matrix for any prescribed set of projected positions of instances. The algorithm can in this case overfit the data (or fit it to anything), resulting in meaningless projections. 2.3 Visualization and interpretation Since FreeViz visualizations may contain many features, they can reveal a lot of information, yet may not be trivial to interpret. Following is a list of choices we have made in terms of data presentation aimed at producing clear visualizations, and a few guidelines on how to interpret the resulting graphs. 2.3.1 Presentation of base vectors In visualizations we have introduced in this paper the projections of base vectors are represented with lines, except for Fig. 4, where base vectors are visualized through a symbol at the non-origin end-point of the vector projection. The former emphasizes the mathematical meaning of the presentation, since the lines represent the coordinate axes in the original space. Base vectors presented in this way are also easier to spot and compare. Instead of using lines, the symbol-based representation of base vectors can be motivated by Gestalt laws of perception[8]: grouping by proximity, on which the interpretation of FreeViz graphs relies, could be disturbed by the connectedness suggested by the base vector lines. Symbols in place of lines may also be favored when the data set has many attributes, in avoidance of obscuring the picture with too many vector lines. 2.3.2 Use of colors and color shading The projections of instances are shown as points that can be colored to signify their class membership. We can also color the region in which a certain class prevails with the corresponding color (see Section 2.4 for coloring procedure). In black and white prints, we can use different symbols and shade the region corresponding to a certain class. The latter is only suitable for binary problems. 2.3.3 Feature\u2019s importance w.r.t. classification Biomedical data sets most often include features with varying influences on the observed instance class. In linear projections with normalized features, features with longer projections of base vectors are those that have a higher impact on the placement of instances. As FreeViz optimizes the projection with respect to classification, features that are more important for classification will generally have longer projections. One should also observe the direction of the projection: the more perpendicular it is to the line (or curve) that separates two clusters, the more useful it is for distinguishing between them. When dealing with many features, we can expose the most important ones by explicitly visualizing base vectors only if their end points exceed a certain distance from the center. We did so in most pictures in this paper and marked the area within which the base vectors are not shown with a dashed circle. 2.3.4 Projection co-location of features and instances The lines representing the base vector projection show the direction in which to expect the instances with the high value of the corresponding feature. If a region in the graph is mostly populated by instances of a certain class, the features in that direction may be good indicators of that class. On the zoology graph (Fig. 1f), fins are a good indicator for fish. 2.3.5 Feature clustering/separation In trying to group the instances of the same class, the optimization procedure will place the features with the same effect on the class closer together and the features with the opposite effects away from each other. On the zoology graph, hair and milk have the same effect on the class (i.e., both predict mammals) and are opposite of laying eggs, having feathers and being airborne. There are indeed only a few animals that lay eggs and give milk, and there is a choice between feathers and hair. The other axis separates the breathing animals from the aquatic. 2.3.6 \u201cOrthogonal\u201d features Multi-class problems may result in the feature sets spread all around the visualization. This may indicate that certain groups of features are orthogonal to each other. In the zoology graph, breathing and having legs may be a feature of both mammals (who give milk) and insects and birds (eggs, airborne). A similar spread is less common and harder to interpret in binary class problems. 2.3.7 Class-value clustering Instances of classes that resemble each other are placed closer together (literally, if they are harder to separate, they are less separated). The zoology graph has insects and birds together. Amphibians are close to the fish and reptiles, and not far from invertebrates. 2.3.8 Discovery of sub-classes The projection may separate instances of a certain class and place them in two or more clusters. This can be easily spotted in the zoology graph if we manually move the projection of the vector for airborne towards birds: the change splits the insects into the flying and non-flying. Interpreting the graph needs to be done with a grain of salt. For the zoology data set, we noted that having legs is unrelated to having hair and feathers. Not so with fins\u2014there is probably no animal with fins and feathers or hair at the same time. Positions of instances depend on the values of other attributes as well; an eggs-laying airborne animal with feathers and hair would be placed on the left-hand side of graph in Fig. 1, despite the hair. However, the optimization procedure puts the features with the similar effects closer together and thus aims at avoiding such cases. The reason that mammals are so well-separated from others is also in their abundance in the data: as a large group, they exerted a great force in the optimization process while, for instance, the insects and birds did not have enough power to separate from each other. As we have already warned: the purpose of (any) visualization is to help in the exploration of the data and the generation of working hypothesis, while it is the job of statistics to confirm or reject them. 2.4 Classification To use the FreeViz visualization in classification, we use the projection to find the coordinates of a new, unclassified instance and let the instances from the original, training set \u201cvote\u201d for its class, with the weight inversely proportional to their distance to the new instance. The classifier can either predict a class or normalize the distribution of votes to obtain a class probability estimate. Probability estimates obtained in this way can also be used for coloring the graphs. For each point in the Fig. 1 we computed the class probabilities and plotted it with the color corresponding to the most probable class, with color saturation proportional the class probability. 3 Experiments and discussion We here provide several case studies that further illustrate the applicability of FreeViz as a tool to perform explorative analysis and supervised data mining. 3.1 Case studies We have used the data from several publically available data sets from domain of clinical or veterinary medicine from the UCI machine learning repository [7]. In Wisconsin breast cancer data set (Fig. 3 c), FreeViz found an excellent separation based on the mean and the worst number of concave points as indicators of malignity, and the mean and the worst fractal dimension and smoothness as indicators of benignity. The pairs of attributes which are expected to be correlated (the mean and the largest values) are placed together in the graph. In the four-valued problem from lymphography (Fig. 3d), the two biggest classes are separated by the number of nodes, lymph. enlargement and oval shapes, which all indicate malignity, as opposed to marginal changes which are more common in metastases. The third, rather small class of fibrosis is distinguished by having a high value for lym-dimin. This was confirmed by plotting the histogram for that feature. The fourth class contains only two instances, which could not be separated from the others. The projection for horse colic (Fig. 3e) is interesting for featuring a strong cluster of horses which survived the disease, while the horses that died or were euthanized are scattered around the cluster. There may be two explanations: the surviving horses may indeed be similar to each other (the especially important features are high rectal temperature and reflux pH), while straying away in any direction (severe pain, high pulse or cell volume, etc.) may indicate a more serious condition. The other explanation is rather technical: the surviving horses represent two thirds of the data, so they have a stronger influence on the optimization than the minority classes which failed to group. What is truly the case should be determined by further investigation of the data. In the data for heart disease (Fig. 3f), the patients are split across SW\u2013NE line, with those in the upper-left part having narrowed vessels. All patients had a certain kind of chest pain, of which typical and atypical anginal pain and non-anginal pain seem to be the symptoms of the disease, for a contrast from the asymptomatic pain which was more likely experienced by the patients without this particular heart disease. The features lying on the SW\u2013NE axis separate the patients that lie closer to the margin between the two groups, with the maximal heart rate under exercise being a good indicator for a healthy heart. This is intuitively correct and was confirmed with a histogram. The role of the cholesterol was also checked in a histogram, which showed that the relation between cholesterol and the disease is rather weak. Higher age and defects discovered with the thal test are, on the other hand, indicators for narrowed vessels, as expected. To test the visualization on the data that includes more features, we have used several gene expression cancer data sets. The resulting visualizations are shown in Fig. 4 . The feature names are intentionally and for the sake of clarity not displayed, as we focus only on the study of class-separability. While biomedical interpretation for these data sets would be required, it is beyond the scope of our reported study. Since these data sets have many more features than cases, which FreeViz cannot handle, we used only 20 most important features (expressions of genes) for each data set as chosen by ReliefF [9]. The exception was Lung cancer data set which has somewhat larger number of instances, where we have chosen a subset of 40 features. Fig. 4.a shows the visualization of the data set that studies the outcome for the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) [10], where the selected 20 features are well able to separate between the two classes. In another example, the data on four types of tumors in childhood (SRBCT) [11], see Fig. 4b, the optimization yielded an even clearer separation. The largest data set we tackled is that on lung cancer [12] with 203 instances, expressions of 12,600 genes and five classes (Fig. 4c). The separation is generally good, except for the class SMCL, which is apparently too small, so the total force due to instances of this class is inferior to the forces by instances of the larger classes. In such cases, the algorithm could be augmented by adjusting the strength of forces according to the sizes of classes. For the brain tumor data [13] with 5920 genes and 90 instances (Fig. 4d), separation was somewhat worse. Again, the instances belonging to the smaller classes (Nc, Np) are lost between those of the larger classes. In all cases, selecting the features by ReliefF took up to half a minute, while FreeViz optimization took a few seconds on a mediocre PC (Pentium IV, 1800MHz). 3.2 Discussion Do the FreeViz visualizations depict the true relations in the data or are they result of data overfit? First and where possible, we checked the projections against our background knowledge of the domain. An excellent (and in this respect the simplest) example is the zoology data set, where the projections of base vectors and the corresponding animal\u2019s positions agree perfectly with the common knowledge, and we were able to easily interpret the graph. We did not venture into deep interpretation of FreeViz visualizations for other data sets, or at least have not done so beyond common reasoning exerted in the section above. But it was clear that in most if not all the cases FreeViz found clear separations of instances of different class. To verify that this is not an overfitting we have run ten-fold cross-validation test on the data sets presented in this paper. That is, we have split the data into ten sets of approximately equal size and class distribution. FreeViz was then run on instances from nine sets, leaving the remaining one for testing. Repeating this ten times, each time for a different test set, we have observed classification accuracy and area under ROC [14] on test sets and averaged the scores across ten runs. The scores were then compared to majority classification (classification to the most frequent class in the learning set), and to support vector machines (SVM) with linear kernel. In this preliminary study, FreeViz results were significantly different from a majority classification, being slightly worst than SVM in terms of classification accuracy and slightly better in terms of area under ROC. These results are encouraging, and show that\u2014as expected\u2014FreeViz indeed finds non-random patterns, with the study being preliminary and of more interest to machine learning community than to explorative data analysis, as is the focus in this paper. 4 Related work Lying on the crossroads of visualization, machine learning and statistics, the presented method bears similarity with techniques coming from these diverse fields. 4.1 RadViz RadViz [15] is a method which initially inspired the development of FreeViz. RadViz visualization is defined in terms of anchors, which are placed evenly around the unit circle. The data instances are plotted inside the circle, the position of each determined by the value of its features and the positions of the corresponding anchors. Informally, each anchor pulls the instance towards itself with a strength proportional to the value of the corresponding feature, so the position of an example depends upon the relative values of features (e.g. if all features have equal values, the instance is placed in the center). Despite a slightly different mathematical formulation, RadViz and FreeViz are similar with the essential difference that in FreeViz the \u201canchors\u201d can be anywhere in the projection plane and are not placed evenly around the circle. Fig. 3a shows a RadViz for three features (smoothness, worst area, worst concavity) of the Wisconsin breast cancer data as used in Section 3. The visualization shows that tissues with large worst area tend to be malign and tissues with a large smoothness are benign, while the role of worst concavity is not clear. The problem arises when (or, better, because) the data instances are described by more than a few features. The actual data set has 20 features and the corresponding RadViz looks as shown in Fig. 3b; the order of feature placement around the circle follows the order of features in the data set. The original RadViz has three major limitations. First, the graph is impossible to interpret when it shows all the features, and manual search through myriads of possible projections is not an option. Second, placing the attributes evenly around the circle implicitly assumes that they are uncorrelated. Allowing the well-correlated features to pull in the same direction should be beneficial in cancelling out the noise in the data. Finally, placing the features on the circle assumes their equal importance, which is clearly not the case in practice. There have been quite a few modifications to alleviate these shortcomings. Among them, Leban et al. [6] developed VizRank, an algorithm which searches through all combinations of features up to a given size (usually anywhere from three to ten) to find projections in which each instance is surrounded mostly by instances of its own class. Due to the huge number of combinations which can on, say, microarray data easily reach 1020, VizRank uses efficient search heuristics which help it to stumble upon good projections within minutes of runtime. The features on Fig. 3a were selected using VizRank. McCarthy et al. [4] proposed a different solution to this problem and dealt with the correlated features by placing the anchors corresponding to the strongly correlated features closer together. FreeViz essentially incorporates both Leban\u2019s and McCarthy\u2019s optimization: correlated features can be (and usually are) placed closer together by the optimization procedure and the less important features can be projected closer to the center. If they are projected exactly into the center, they are effectively removed. VizRank\u2019s advantage is that it can be used even when the number of features strongly exceeds that of instances and is thus useful in the domains with cursed dimensionality, such as with data sets coming from genome-wide gene expression experiments. To use FreeViz on these data sets, we first had to select a suitable feature subset. 4.2 Projection pursuit Projection pursuit was designed by Friedman and Tukey [16] and has a goal to find \u201cinteresting projections\u201d of unlabelled multidimensional data. They defined a projection index which is a product of the global spread and local density of the data. An interesting projection is thus one in which the data is condensed in local clusters which are as apart from each other as possible. Like in FreeViz, they proposed to use a gradient optimization for finding local extrema. Various other projection indices have been proposed since, and the method has been extended to allow for probability density estimation and for regression [2]. Attempts of handling labelled data have been limited to binary problems, either by treating the class as a dummy continuous variable or through using the statistics from Fisher discriminant analysis [17] as projection index. From this viewpoint, FreeViz can be considered a specialization of projection pursuit that deals with class-labelled data. The difference is that FreeViz is not focused on optimizing a certain projection index but instead uses a metaphor from particle physics which directly defines the gradients and results in an optimization method with a simple physical interpretation. FreeViz is in this respect unique, as we are not aware of any projection pursuit approach that would naturally handle multi-class supervised data sets. 4.3 Principle components analysis (PCA) Principle components analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique which finds the projection in which the greatest variance of the data set lies along the first axis, the second greatest variance along the second one and so on. Although also often used in analysis of labelled data, PCA is an unsupervised technique that is not specifically designed for finding good separation of classes and can easily miss such projections. PCA is also quite susceptible to outliers. [18]. FreeViz is somewhat related to PCA. PCA maximizes the variance, which equals to 1 2 \u2211 e , f r e , f 2 . FreeViz would optimize the same criterion function as PCA if all examples repelled each other with forces proportional to the distances, that is, F e,f \u223c r e,f , disregarding the classes of e and f. However, it would make little sense to use FreeViz for such an optimization since PCA solves the optimization problem more efficiently. Unlike in PCA, the number of dimensions in FreeViz is fixed in advance. Besides, PCA constructs projections, while FreeViz optimizes general linear transformations. Koren and Carmel [18,19] describe an exciting modification of PCA which makes it quite similar to FreeViz. Instead of ordinary variance, their PCA maximizes a weighted variance, \u2211 e , f d e , f r e , f 2 , where d e,f is not a function of the projection but is fixed in advance. If d e,f conforms to certain limitations, the optimization problem is still solvable using a generalized eigenvalue decomposition, like in PCA. With d e,f =1, the method resolves into the standard PCA. Among different other choices for d e,f there are several with which the PCA can be turned into a supervised method unsusceptible to outliers. FreeViz uses optimization that is more general than the one proposed by Koren and Carmel. Like PCA, their method is limited to optimizing the weighted sum of squares, which is equivalent to linear forces that raise with the distance; this limitation is needed to maintain the problem solvable by eigenvalue decomposition. Koren and Carmel remedy the problems with outliers by dividing the weight (or the force, in FreeViz) by the distance between the two examples in the original space. Based on the reasoning in Section 2.1 we believe that the repulsive forces should diminish and not increase with the distance, which also alleviates the problem of outliers. FreeViz can be used to optimize any of the functions proposed by Koren and Carmel, while the opposite is not the case. Their algorithm has also another limitation: the method looks for projections or for a kind of generalized orthonormal projections. The authors turn this to a potential advantage by looking for the projections in which the projected coordinates are uncorrelated, which should prevent the loss of information through the correlated features. We do not see how this potentially beneficial constraint could be added to FreeViz. We should also note that the supervised PCA does not require an iterative optimization procedure although, on the other hand, FreeViz optimization typically takes only a few seconds at most. Concerned with the analysis of principal components, Koren and Carmel mostly neglect their method\u2019s use for visualization-based explorative data analysis. Our testing showed that projections defined by the first two components of their modified PCA are usually quite different from those found by FreeViz. None of the two methods, though, has a clear advantage over the other; one of them may find an excellent class separation even in a case when the other fails completely. 4.4 Related machine learning methods One way to look at the optimization is that it finds a good feature space transformation for a kNN-like classifier. From that point of view, FreeViz is a constructive induction method or, more accurately, a feature transformation algorithm, since it replaces the original attributes by two new features. These two are explicitly expressed as the x and y coordinates in the projected space, but we can reinterpret them by any perpendicular axes in the projection. For instance, in the zoo data set (Fig. 1), the first feature can be having hair, teeth and giving milk against having feather, laying eggs and fly, and the second would be having legs and breath against being aquatic and having tail, fins and backbone. There is abundance of methods for optimizing the kNN metrics in machine learning [20]. Since they are not limited to (two or three dimensional) projections, they may yield better classification performance than FreeViz, yet they usually offer no visualization of the classifier or explanation of its decisions and are thus less suitable for the area of biomedicine. 5 Conclusion The paper presents a new method for intelligent visualization of class-labelled, multi-dimensional data sets. We have presented its utility on a number of biomedical data sets. Results of these preliminary studies are very encouraging: FreeViz is very fast and in all presented cases found visualizations of high quality with clear class separation. In the paper we have focused on explorative data analysis side of the FreeViz, and were primarily interested in its ability to find class-separated visualizations and their interpretation. We have hinted that as such the projection it finds may be used as a probabilistic classifier. This issue deserves further attention and should be explored in the ongoing research. FreeViz is available as a part of Linear Projection visualization widget in open-source data mining suite Orange (www.ailab.si/orange, [21,22]). As such it also offers other functionality, such as manually adjusting the projection, selecting subsets of examples and similar, which is due to its triviality not described in this paper, but can turn practical data exploration with this widget into an exciting experience.

It plays a crucial role in explorative data analysis and may support various data mining tasks. The paper presents FreeViz, an optimization method that finds linear projection and associated scatterplot that best separates instances of different class. In a single graph, the resulting FreeViz visualization can provide a global view of the classification problem being studied, reveal interesting relations between classes and features, uncover feature interactions, and provide information about intra-class similarities. The paper gives mathematical foundations of FreeViz, and presents its utility on various biomedical data sets.", "openArchiveArticle": "true", "prism:coverDate": "2007-12-31", "openaccessUserLicense": "http://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/", "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1532046407000275", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Dem\u0161ar, Janez"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Leban, Gregor"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Zupan, Bla\u017e"}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1532046407000275"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046407000275"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": "Full", "pii": "S1532-0464(07)00027-5", "prism:volume": "40", "prism:publisher": "Elsevier Inc.", "dc:title": "FreeViz\u2014An intelligent multivariate visualization approach to explorative analysis of biomedical data", "prism:copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 2007 Elsevier Inc.
