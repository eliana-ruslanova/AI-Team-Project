Graphs that have optimized their output for particular inputs with respect to predetermined outputs are asymptotically stable and can be characterized by attractors, which form a representation space for an associative multiplicative structure of input operations. As the mapping from a series of inputs onto a series of such attractors generally depends on the sequence of inputs, this structure is generally non-commutative. Moreover, the size of the set of attractors, indicating the complexity of learning, is found to behave non-monotonically as learning proceeds. A tentative relation between this complexity and the notion of pragmatic information is indicated.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Complexity"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Graph theory"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Non-commutativity"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Pragmatic information"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Recurrent networks"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Supervised learning"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0303264706000451", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303264706000451", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "33744920348", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-33744920348", "pubmed-id": "16687206", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33744920348", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20060509", "$": "2006-05-09"}}}}}
