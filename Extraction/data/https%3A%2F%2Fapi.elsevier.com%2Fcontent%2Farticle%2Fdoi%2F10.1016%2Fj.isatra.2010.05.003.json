In this paper, based on a simulation system model of PMSM position servo control, the cogging force, viscous friction, and applied load in the real PMSM control system are considered and presented. A dual high-order periodic adaptive learning compensation (DHO-PALC) method is proposed to minimize the cogging effect on the PMSM position and velocity servo system. In this DHO-PALC scheme, more than one previous periods stored information of both the composite tracking error and the estimate of the cogging force is used for the control law updating. Asymptotical stability proof with the proposed DHO-PALC scheme is presented. Simulation is implemented on the PMSM servo system model to illustrate the proposed method. When the constant speed reference is applied, the DHO-PALC can achieve a faster learning convergence speed than the first-order periodic adaptive learning compensation (FO-PALC). Moreover, when the designed reference signal changes periodically, the proposed DHO-PALC can obtain not only faster convergence speed, but also much smaller final error bound than the FO-PALC.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Cogging force"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM)"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Adaptive control"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Dual high-order periodic adaptive learning control"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "State-dependent disturbance"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019057810000571", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019057810000571", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "77957901203", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-77957901203", "pubmed-id": "20605022", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77957901203", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20100705", "$": "2010-07-05"}}}}}
