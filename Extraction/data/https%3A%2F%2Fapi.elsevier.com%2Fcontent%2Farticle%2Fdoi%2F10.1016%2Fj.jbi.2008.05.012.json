Abstract As emerging technologies, semantic Web and SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) allow BPMS (Business Process Management System) to automate business processes that can be described as services, which in turn can be used to wrap existing enterprise applications. BPMS provides tools and methodologies to compose Web services that can be executed as business processes and monitored by BPM (Business Process Management) consoles. Ontologies are a formal declarative knowledge representation model. It provides a foundation upon which machine understandable knowledge can be obtained, and as a result, it makes machine intelligence possible. Healthcare systems can adopt these technologies to make them ubiquitous, adaptive, and intelligent, and then serve patients better. This paper presents an ontological knowledge framework that covers healthcare domains that a hospital encompasses\u2014from the medical or administrative tasks, to hospital assets, medical insurances, patient records, drugs, and regulations. Therefore, our ontology makes our vision of personalized healthcare possible by capturing all necessary knowledge for a complex personalized healthcare scenario involving patient care, insurance policies, and drug prescriptions, and compliances. For example, our ontology facilitates a workflow management system to allow users, from physicians to administrative assistants, to manage, even create context-aware new medical workflows and execute them on-the-fly. Keywords Medical workflow Ontology Knowledge representation Business process management Service oriented architecture 1 Introduction As a formal declarative knowledge representation model, an ontology provides a foundation for machine understandable knowledge, which in turn makes machine intelligence possible. To automate personalized healthcare workflows, we develop a framework of healthcare ontology to describe a healthcare network including hospital resources and processes, and to serve as a knowledge base for our healthcare information management system\u2014in particular a workflow management system. By providing a more comprehensible and formal semantics, ontology helps the functionalities of services in a workflow to be described and advertised from a business perspective, and then these functionalities can be discovered and composed by business specialists, instead of IT professionals. Moreover, ontology helps the relationships, properties of concepts to be rigorously defined and linked to business objects, which in turn are defined as concepts. Therefore, the use of and reference to ontology help business rules, enterprise policies, and personalized patient context to be described in a machine understandable way to support adaptive workflow composition and execution. With the widespread of Internet and Web services, workflows are becoming ubiquitous in enterprise applications from manufacturing industry to healthcare industry. From a process-centric point of view, a workflow is a process composed of a set of activities, each of which is fulfilled by performing a service. Workflows encompass both system processes and human workflows. Herein, we use the process and workflow terms interchangeably. From a SOA point of view, a workflow is a set of services and a specification for the control and data flow among these services to address some business needs. SOA has become the most praised way to deal with issues in enterprise application integration, such as interoperability, development efficiency and system scalability. BPM systems provide methodologies to govern service selection, composition, execution, and monitoring in a SOA framework. With the proposed ontological healthcare network, we implemented an adaptive medical workflow system. Our system allows users to: (1) control and monitor the process flow that a patient will pass through; (2) manage patient\u2019s medical record and personal data; (3) create new processes composed of tasks from a medical service repository; and (4) maintain historical process data for further diagnosis. Note that our intended system users are healthcare professionals such as physicians, therapists, nurses, and administrative assistants who have no or little IT background. Our workflow system, together with the ontological knowledge framework, will help these users to create, mange, and monitor workflows without intervention from IT people. Most existing workflow systems are not able to support process design or composition at semantic level by exploiting ontological knowledge. They are not context-aware and do not support run-time process composition and execution. In contrast, this paper advances the state of the art by (1) developing healthcare processes, resources, organizations, and policies in an ontological knowledge framework; (2) providing a prior knowledge base for task scheduling and resource allocation at semantic level in an adaptive medical workflow system, and (3) bridging the gap between IT and healthcare business by allowing physician to build personalized workflows for patients at runtime. 2 Related work 2.1 Semantic web services and workflows Web services are standard-based software components that can be accessed over the Internet by other software components. Semantic Web services, as envisioned by Berners-Lee [1], are intended to be applied not statically by developers, but dynamically by the services themselves through automatic and autonomous selection, composition, and execution. Many efforts have been made to automate service composition. In [2], the authors introduced a workflow composer agent to compose Web service workflows by finding and matching the semantic descriptions of Web services. Mandell and McIlraith [3] used a bottom-up approach to integrate Semantic Web technology into automating the dynamic discovery and binding of Web services. Processes are ubiquitous in business applications. When we choose a representation for the processes, trade-offs must be made among expressive power, rigor, ease of use, and computational tractability of a representation [4]. In a SOA environment, a workflow can be represented as a set of composed Web services. Therefore, various standards for representing and coordinating Web services have been developed, such as WS-BPEL (Web Service Business Process Execution Language), OWL-S (Ontology Web Language for Services), and WSDL-S (Semantic Web Service Description Language). WS-BPEL, also known as BPEL (Business Process Execution Language), is the most popular and most widely used language in the industry for defining the execution logic of a business process. It uses an (eXtensible Markup Language) XML-based vocabulary to describe business processes, and its code is interpreted by an execution engine. BPEL relies on WSDL (Web Service Description Language) for the description of the messages exchanged between the different participants (Web services). OWL-S is an initiative of the Semantic Web community to facilitate automatic discovery, invocation, composition, interoperation, and monitoring of Web services through their semantic description [5]. OWL-S supports a richer semantic description of Web services by: (1) a profile that describes what the service does, (2) a process model that specifies how the service works in terms of inputs, outputs, preconditions, and results, a.k.a., IOPRs, and (3) a grounding that defines how the service is accessed. OWL-S augments the input and output specifications of WS-BPEL with preconditions and results, by which the side effects of services, can be encoded. 2.2 Ontology and ontological knowledge base An ontology is a data model that represents a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships among those concepts. It is used by machines to reason about the objects within that domain. RDF (Resource Description Framework) is an XML-based syntax standard where one can define statements about a resource in the form of subject-predicate-object expressions called triples [6]. RDF Schema (RDFS) defines the semantics of any particular domain with which concepts can be readily described and referred by RDF. Both RDF and RDFS have limited expressive power. OWL (Web Ontology Language) provides a more expressive ontological description of complex relations between concept pairs than RDFS does. RDFS elements can be used to define a concept in terms of a class and assigned properties in OWL. A knowledge base may use ontology to specify its structure (entity types and relationships) and its classification scheme. Ontology, together with a set of instances of its classes constitutes a knowledge base that includes: (1) a set of concepts, properties, and the relationships among them in a specific application domain, (2) high-level abstraction of rules in the form of constraints, low-level rules defined with semantic rule markup language such as SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) [7], (3) semantic service descriptions and (4) a semantic model of event context. A ontological knowledge base builds the metadata needed by a program to understand its environment and status, reason about them, then this program can composed services automatically to create new tasks, which in turn can be scheduled with optimized resource while complying with business policies and compliances. 2.3 Workflow and data exchange in healthcare Healthcare workflow management systems are critical for enabling efficient and quality-improved work in healthcare enterprise and for individual healthcare professionals. Dickmann [8] considered IT-managed workflows as a cornerstone for data and application integration in healthcare industry, and investigated the existing Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) imaging workflow and Health Level (HL) standard-based clinical information system. He proposed a better workflow integration of the above two systems. With the emergence of e-filing and electronic data/document exchange, issues like electronic signature and digital certificate are becoming more and more important. Emanuele and Koetter [9] discussed these issues, and explored how BPM and workflow technology can make a profound impact on the issues while examining the challenges of dada and process integrations. Shaikh [10] discussed and outlined a method to combine identity management with automated healthcare workflow. In pharmaceutical industry, BPM has received increasing interest. Simon [11] provided a case study of BPM solution in clinical research and development (R&D) to manage efficiency and compliance. To support prescribing decision software, Liaw et al. [12] proposed a formal analysis and modeling methodology to define and capture the process and logic of prescribing practice in a process reference, which is expressed in BPEL using a SOA approach. As discussed in [13], BPM-over-SOA is for business agility. BPM address business needs and design flexible processes that are based on services, which can be implemented later with SOA infrastructure. New and changed processes modeled in the BPM may be implemented in the SOA infrastructure more rapidly because the SOA decouples the described service from the specific implementation of particular service [14]. We believe BPM is the SOA enabler. It provides the governance to service composition, execution, and coordination. Semantic Web technologies including ontology make the machine intelligence possible. Healthcare systems can adopt ontology, BPEL processes, and semantic Web services when dealing with workflows applied in a healthcare enterprise. By doing this, the systems can coordinate the processes to improve the service they deliver, monitor the status of the tasks in real-time and change the flow according to the context. This paper aims to propose an ontological knowledge framework that allows a medical workflow system to deliver these features to a hospital. In the rest of the paper, Section 3 introduces Siemens healthcare process reference with a motivating medical workflow scenario. Section 4 presents our ontological knowledge framework named the healthcare network. Section 5 describes the system architecture and components with an emphasis on dynamic process composition, and Section 6 concludes. 3 Background 3.1 Healthcare process references To build an adaptive workflow system for hospitals, it is important to build a process model by which hospitals can take good care of their patients. The Medical Global Solutions (MED) group at Siemens adopted a methodological approach, and developed a hierarchical healthcare process references to describe different processes accomplished in a healthcare enterprise. As illustrated in Fig. 1 , a patient passes through four main phases: Admit, Detect, Treat and Discharge. Each of these can be again separated in different sub-phases and composed of atomic processes. This process model provides a base for us to describe the semantics of healthcare processes. As a core component, a semantic service repository is defined and included in our knowledge framework, which make their content and relationships explicit for machine intelligence. Therefore, Non-IT users such as physicians and therapists can compose new healthcare processes, deploy and execute these processes to treat patients better in an agile and flexible way. 3.2 A motivating scenario Here, we introduce our motivating scenario with a simplified healthcare process. The Admit phase starts when a patient comes into a hospital, he/she should register himself/herself in a waiting list. An administrative assistant can check the relevant data including insurance information, medical history, patient address, emergency contact, etc. Then the patient will go through the Detect phase when a healthcare professional like physician might do some tests, such as blood test or X-ray test. Then, the Treat phase follows and consists of treating the patient\u2019s disease for instance by applying a surgery and/or a plaster. The last phase is Discharge when the patient leaves the hospital and all relevant data including the processes he/she has been through is gathered and saved for record and future diagnosis. Even with a well defined process reference, it is difficult to handle all events and emergencies in a hospital. From a patient\u2019s view, patient may have to have his/her processes including treatment plan updated from time to time. This uncertainty and dynamics exist because of: (1) the new come findings from test, unexpected outcome from treatment, (2) lack of resource, and (3) emergency. From a hospital\u2019s view, a hospital may want to dynamically route tasks among physicians and resources to provide better care, timely response with minimized cost. Our system provides an intuitive way to users to create and execute a context-aware user-specific process for patients. Moreover, this newly created process can be stored in our service repository for the future use. 4 Ontological knowledge framework Business rules are used to represent business policies and logics. Ontologies provide a formal semantic knowledge representation model to capture business objects as concepts and business rules behind the described business objects. Properties, constraints, and relations are defined to describe high-level business rules. Meantime, low-level business rules including business logic can be described explicitly with SWRL clauses. In this project, we define an ontological knowledge framework of a healthcare network as the schema for our ontological knowledge base. To provide a detailed view of all the entities involved when a patient goes to a hospital, this framework covers the domains that a healthcare enterprise encompasses\u2014in particular a hospital-from the medical or administrative tasks, to hospital assets, medical insurances, patient records, drugs and regulations. Therefore, it allows this ontological knowledge framework to capture all necessary knowledge for a more complex scenario involving patient care, insurance policies, and drug prescriptions, and compliances. To build the proposed knowledge framework, we need to obtain the corresponding domain knowledge. There are two major resources for us to extract the domain knowledge: Siemens Medical Solution (MED) group and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) [15]. Siemens MED [8] has conducted an extensive study on processes accomplished in a hospital and resources involved in the processes, as well as workflow systems integrated with other legacy systems in a hospital. We created our process-centric tasks and roles based on Siemens Healthcare Process Reference. AHRQ, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) aims to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of healthcare. It provides clinical practice guideline, quality and patient safety information, which serve as the basis of our Key Performance Indictors (KPIs) in a healthcare system. For demonstration purpose (see Fig. 2 ), we defined our ontology in OWL by using the Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Ontology Editor, an open-source ontology tools from Stanford University [16]. To accurately describe healthcare concepts and events, we need to aggregate knowledge from different domains and disparate resources. This is a challenging task since we need to choose the right model, which should be efficient, lightweight, business-driven and context-aware. ARIS EPC (Event-Driven Process Chains) has been created specifically for business process modeling [17]. The EPC model provides a \u201ccomplete\u201d description of a process from five different views, namely organization, function, product/service, data, and process/control. The organization view describes the entities involved in the business process, along with their communication executed, as well as their sequence. The product/service view describes concrete products or unsubstantial services and their flows, including fund flows. The data view shows the information objects of the business process and the data interchanged among them. Finally, all the views are integrated within the process/control view. Based on the EPC model, we proposed a novel model to align domain knowledge from a process-centric view, and developed the ontological healthcare framework using this model. Our framework has a root concept named Healthcare Network with five high-level views: Role, Resource, Organization, KPI, and Process. Concepts are defined as classes in ontology while binary relations are defined as properties. Based on a simplified version of the ontological knowledge framework, we will discuss five different views and their relationships from a process-centric viewpoint. A role is an abstraction of capabilities used by an actor in dealing with a process (task). An actor may have several roles; each is associated with different process under different contexts. It is essential to define roles and to have formalization of their capabilities and hierarchy. For example, by defining roles and the tasks they are assigned as prior knowledge in ontology, we can allow only physicians to create new processes and deploy them. Properties are defined to describe the relationships among concepts, which are defined as classes as well. From Fig. 3 , we can see that the classes Task and Role are related with a \u201cperforms\u201d property from Role to Task. The inverse function is \u201cperformedBy\u201d. This property allows us to distinguish which Role is responsible to accomplish which Task. More precisely, in a lower level, we define the relation that only Nurse performs BloodTest which states that only a staff member of the hospital who is a Nurse can do the BloodTest. Using OWL ontology gives us a very powerful tool to model all the constraints related to the domain of the hospital. Note that these constraints reflect business policies and they are part of business rules. As discussed in the previous section, we choose OWL over RDFS since OWL has more expression power. As an example to better understand this, the following OWL definition tells us that the class Role has a sub-class Physician, which disjoints the class AdministrativeAssistant and the class SupportStaff. As an instance of the Physician class, a physician has tasks including SurgicalOperation and deployNewProcess. <owl:Class rdf:ID=\u201dPhysician\u201d> <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource=\u201d#Role\u201d/> <rdfs:subClassOf> <owl:Restriction> <owl:onProperty rdf:resource=\u201d#hasTasks\u201d/> <owl:someValuesFrom rdf:resource=\u201d#SurgicalOperation\u201d/> </owl:Restriction> </rdfs:subClassOf> <rdfs:subClassOf> <owl:Restriction> <owl:onProperty rdf:resource=\u201d#deployNewProcess\u201d/> <owl:hasValue rdf:datatype=\u201d&xsd;boolean\u201d>true</owl:hasValue> </owl:Restriction> </rdfs:subClassOf> <owl:disjointWith rdf:resource=\u201d#AdministrativeAssistant\u201d/> <owl:disjointWith rdf:resource=\u201d#SupportStaff\u201d/> </owl:Class> As shown in Fig. 4 , the inverse function \u201cisPerformedBy\u201d is used to retrieve all the people who can perform a given task. This does not exist in the RDFS ontology. RDFS does not allow us to use quantifiers, for instance the relation that \u201conly Nurse performs BloodTest\u201d. You can see in Fig. 4 that Nurse has a property \u201croleID\u201d which is fixed to a default value. This ensures that the instances of Employee who have the role of Nurse have also their \u201croleID\u201d property fixed. Another property \u201cdeployNewProcess\u201d has a fixed Boolean value which is false. It sets the right to a user of the system to deploy new process in the workflow. Thus a Nurse cannot do that, in the current state, only physicians are allowed to do it. Many other OWL features like properties union and intersection could be used in the future. This is an important aspect that convinces us to use OWL instead of RDFS. Any resources including assets and people involved in a healthcare activity are defined in the resource view, which is dedicated to the resources that a healthcare organization and more precisely a hospital has. The relation \u201chasResource\u201d between HospitalDepartment and Resource, as well as its inverse function \u201cbelongsToDpt\u201d formalizes this constraint. Moreover, the relation \u201cuses\u201d between Task and Resource can help to manage the resources that a process needs to use. For instance, when a physician orders an X-Ray to be done on a patient and that the corresponding room is not available, the system can then schedule the tasks to be done and alert the physician when it has been accomplished. Further issues of managing assets related to beds in a department and rooms can also be solved using the ontology and keeping track which ones are free and which ones are occupied. The patient is also assigned to a department and the assets used during the Detect and Treat step can also be monitored with the help of the ontology. Organization view provides the organization context to both role and resource. The relations between the departments and their employees have also been implemented by adding the property \u201cemploys\u201d and the inverse \u201cemployedBy\u201d between the classes HospitalDepartment and Employee. As shown in Fig. 3, employee, a sub-class of resource, has a role defined in the role view and is employed by a healthcare organization. Another relation between Patient and HospitalDepartment will allow the system to keep track of a patient\u2019s stay in a department. The transfer of a patient between departments can then be more easily updated. Besides the administrative point of view, the ontology gives us also the opportunity to connect it with other ones, like an allergy ontology related to symptoms and connected to the Patient class. This could be a great help for a practitioner when prescribing medications. With the help of a reasoning system the practitioner will be notified of the allergies to which a patient is. The other use of the ontology is the control of the workflow executed in terms of BPEL processes. More specifically, the dynamic workflow part where processes like BloodTest or XRayTest can be injected in the flow of processes as long as the constraints are respected. For instance, in our ontology we define the Boolean datatype property \u201cisAtomic\u201d to test if the process can be executed in the context of a higher one like Detect or Treat. We have also defined the \u201cisPartOf\u201d object property between two tasks to only allow certain processes to be deployed under certain contexts. For instance, BloodTest can only be executed under the Detect context. These constraints can be easily changed in the ontology by adding or removing restrictions. KPI view defines all necessary indictors used to evaluate the performance of a healthcare organization [18]. In the context of processes analysis and optimization, KPIs in our ontology framework will play an important role to meet both business and operation excellence. These indictors are intended to monitor the performance from different view points and they draw interests from different user groups: From a financial point of view, an average income per patient can be calculated and added to the individuals of the ontology. From a management point of view, the assets like the beds or rooms can also be monitored in order to see which department and rooms inside the hospital are the most requested. This will allow the hospital to optimize its assets utilization. Task scheduling can be done for the employee utilization to see at what time in average, an employee is free or which ones are the most requested, in order to balance the staff\u2019s need. Many properties have been defined for the KPIs like the turnover rate of the hospital staff or the ones of the patients, the roomOccupation percentage for each room, the average number of patients discharged and admitted per day, etc. Other properties could be added to the ontology to reach a level of details which will allow the managers and practitioners to optimize the tasks in terms of efficiency and cost. These Ontological PKIs will lead to the implementation of an intelligent scheduling system and resource management to improve healthcare performance with higher efficiency and lower cost. Process view unifies all other views by: (1) consuming assets and people from resource view, (2) specifying actors with roles defined in role view, and (3) providing process activity information and business data to calculate KPIs from the KPI view. We created a process view by separating business rules represented in knowledge base from process logic defined in processes, and adding the semantic layer into the healthcare process reference. Processes in this hierarchy are defined in terms of their actors, inputs, outputs, preconditions, and results (AIOPRs). All concepts involved in the process AIOPRs are defined in other views namely resource, role, and organization. In addition, Some KPI-related concepts are also defined in the AIOPRs to extract process data in the execution time for KPI monitoring and analysis. 5 Adaptive workflow system In this section, we present an adaptive workflow system that adopts the proposed ontological knowledge framework as the knowledge base. Our ontology framework provides a foundation for describing patient context, healthcare processes, rules and resources. The ontological framework makes knowledge and information understandable to the workflow system. Therefore it helps our workflow system to (1) dynamically compose a personalized workflow, (2) automate the execution of the workflow, (3) and monitor its performance. 5.1 System architecture This workflow management system is composed of several web applications. There is a BPEL Server deployed on the Oracle application server for J2EE, which is the cornerstone of our system. As shown in Fig. 5 , we implemented a knowledge engine to retrieve business rules and logics from the ontological knowledge base. Eventually we created a prototype of workflow system that makes use of the knowledge engine to allow dynamic workflow composition and execution, and it goes further by putting the bases for a run-time resource allocation and task scheduling system for users. Here, we are going to explain major applications implemented and deployed in this workflow system: \u2022 TaskAssigner on the Tomcat server is the web service in charge of assigning tasks to different roles and checking their status. \u2022 KnowledgeRetrieveEngine is the application that uses Jena APIs to save ontologies in a relational database. It can also be used by other applications to retrieve ontological knowledge from the database. \u2022 ProcessComposition is the web service called when a physician wants to create and deploy a new process. The service creates all necessary files for the process and deploys them on the Oracle BPEL Server. 5.2 Dynamic process composition As described before, the dynamic workflow composition is one of the main features of our system. With the support from the proposed ontological knowledge framework, our workflow system makes adaptive personalized workflow possible by letting healthcare specialists create new medical processes without knowing anything about IT infrastructure or BPEL code. In detect or treat phases, a physician can create a new composite process in a graphic user interface by choosing atomic processes from a service repository and arranging them in sequence or in parallel. These atomic processes are defined in Web service description language and stored in a service repository. The pool of available processes for the physician keeps updating based on his/her current choice and context including hospital status and system performance. In addition, processes are available for the physician only if these processes comply with the business rules defined in the ontological knowledge framework. Therefore, the newly created process can better serve the particular patient with the optimized process and reduced cost while following all business rules. There is no need of a lot of small tailor-made connector services to create a new workflow. As described before, once a BPEL workflow is composed from the existing services, our system will generate necessary files to make the workflow deployable and executable. Our goal is to bridge the gap between business and IT, i.e., our system allow business people create new workflows without the intervention from IT developers. Ontological knowledge framework, together with the knowledge retrieve engine, helps us to separate the business rules from process logic while align them within an ontological knowledge base. This system can be seen as the first accomplishment from us to bridge healthcare needs and IT technologies in a hospital. In addition, the system constructs the tree of relationship between the parent process, the context in which the process has been deployed, and the new process. This allows the users to see the history of all the processes that a patient has passed through and build a personalized healthcare process for the patient. For the sake of usability, our system allows users to save newly composed processes on the BPEL Server, and make them available for the future use. 6 Future work This paper presents an ontological knowledge framework and the use of this framework in an adaptive workflow system. There are several possible directions for future work. First, we will adopt a semantic rule engine to enhance the ontological knowledge retrieval and reasoning features. Second, we will develop a systematical methodology to design process-centric ontology and align ontological business objects developed for healthcare processes from different purposes: Business Process Modeling, Business Intelligence, and Business Performance Management. Finally, we are exploring OWL-S semantic Web service description to elaborate the automation process selection and composition.
