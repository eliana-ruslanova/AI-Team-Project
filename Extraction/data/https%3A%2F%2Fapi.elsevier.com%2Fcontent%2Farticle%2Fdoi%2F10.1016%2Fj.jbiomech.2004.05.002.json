The gaits of 12 young and 12 elderly participants were recorded and analysed using a synchronized PEAK motion analysis system and a force platform during normal walking. Altogether, 24 gait features describing the three types of gait characteristics were extracted for developing gait recognition models and later testing of generalization performance. Test results indicated an overall accuracy of 91.7% by the SVM in its capacity to distinguish the two gait patterns. The classification ability of the SVM was found to be unaffected across six kernel functions (linear, polynomial, radial basis, exponential radial basis, multi-layer perceptron and spline). Gait recognition rate improved when features were selected from different gait data type. A feature selection algorithm demonstrated that as little as three gait features, one selected from each data type, could effectively distinguish the age groups with 100% accuracy. These results demonstrate considerable potential in applying SVMs in gait classification for many applications.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Gait"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Support vector machine"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Gait classification"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Elderly"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021929004002258", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021929004002258", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "12344268981", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-12344268981", "pubmed-id": "15652537", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/12344268981", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20040619", "$": "2004-06-19"}}}}}
