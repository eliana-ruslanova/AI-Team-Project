These tools are sensitive, adaptive, and responsive to each individual\u2019s needs, habits, gestures and emotions [4,5]. This shift in computing paradigms - AmI is transparent, readily available, and intelligent - is enabled by the tremendous advancements in technology that make computing ubiquitous and is empowered by the demands of people to live in an interactive environment with technology that responds to their various needs [6\u20138]. A critical human need where Ambient Intelligence can be used is health care [7,9], where it can improve and sustain quality of life without increasing financial or care burdens [10,11]. E-health applications are already improving the quality of health care, and the ongoing goal is to enhance the value and efficiency of health care [12,13]. One example of an Ambient Intelligence application is robotic and computer-assisted surgery, which allows physicians to perform remote surgical treatments with smaller incisions and a reduced risk of post-operative infections [14,15]. Additionally, psychiatrists and psychologists are using augmented and virtual reality to improve the efficacy of available treatments for anxiety disorders, eating and weight disorders, and pain management [16,17]. However, in these examples, advanced technologies are always a \u201cclosed experience\u201d, mostly offered in a clinical setting and separated from the spaces and behaviors experienced by patients in their daily lives. Ambient Intelligence may overcome this limitation, allowing a real connection between the fragmented e-health systems and the daily experiences of the patient. While Ambient Intelligence research in health applications is experiencing increasing momentum, it has not reached a level of full maturity. Reasons for this deficiency include the difficulty in working in multidisciplinary contexts and in dealing with a critical domain where errors are unacceptable. Given this situation and the limited number of research papers available in the domain, we asked researchers to discuss innovative and methodologically sound healthcare-based Ambient Intelligent research through this special issue. Our interest was not just in the infrastructure and technology required for achieving AmI in health, such as smart environments and wearable medical devices [18], but also on developing software testing and verification techniques that make such innovations reliable [19]. This special issue is the result of the AmI community\u2019s response to that call. We received a total of 28 paper submissions, from which 18 manuscripts \u2013 1 commentary and 17 research papers \u2013 were ultimately accepted for publication after revisions in response to a rigorous peer-review process. The final articles were selected based on their research contribution to the field, their innovation, and the quality of the writing. Submitted papers cover topics related to computational methods for biosensor analysis; ubiquitous and pervasive health; wireless sensor networks; data models; middleware for health environments; methods for everyday computing in health; smart-health environments; health monitoring; health reasoning and decision making; and ensuring security, reliability, energy efficiency and connectivity in health environments. The articles that were selected for inclusion in this special issue are organized in four categories: methodologies and guidelines for AmI health interactions; computational methods in vital-sign sensors; prediction and recognition of activities, and methods for monitoring and promoting active aging. Here we provide a summary of the research highlighted in this special issue to advance the development of this exciting field. 1.1 Methodologies and guidelines for AmI health interactions Transforming the AmI scenario in reality is not an easy task: both the patient and the physician have to be put at the \u201ccenter of the universe of technologies\u201d, by considering their subjective experience since the first steps of the technology design. To support this process, Triberti and Barello [20] present a theoretical framework to include patient engagement in the design of AmI technologies and suggest different tools to measure patient engagement in technology development and testing of the AmI prototypes for effectiveness. In line with this vision, Cardona Reyes and Mu\u00f1oz Arteaga [21] propose the multidisciplinary production of interactive environments as a technological support for rehabilitation of people with physical disabilities. In their view, establishing a multidisciplinary team involving therapists and technologists facilitates the collaborative production of interactive environments that parallel the evolution of every patient\u2019s rehabilitation. 1.2 Computational methods in vital sign sensors As is stressed by the Information Society Technologies Advisory Group\u2019s vision of AmI [2], the ambient intelligent environment \u201cis sensitive to the presence of living creatures (persons, groups of persons and maybe even animals) in it and supports their activities\u201d. An AmI environment \u201cremembers and anticipates\u201d their behaviors. For this reason, data from vital-sign sensors and their analysis play a critical role in AmI for health applications. This is also reflected by the multiple papers in the Special Issue dealing with this topic. Fernandez-Caballero and colleagues [22] present a proof-of-concept architecture for emotion detection and regulation in smart health environments. The goal of their approach is to detect the patients emotional states by analyzing their physiological signals, facial expressions and behavior and then to help the patient to regulate these emotions towards a positive mood when possible. In this same line of research, but focusing on a different class of vital signs, Heintzman and Kleinberg [23] use glucose levels, insulin dosing, physical activity and sleep data collected from body-worn sensors to gain insight into type 1 diabetes. Through testing on simulation data, they demonstrate that the proposed approach is more accurate than the state of the art, making substantially fewer false discoveries. An open gap in this field is a method to integrate sensor-provided and self-reported data. To address this need, Blaauw and colleagues [24] present a platform that collects and integrates data from commercially-available sensors and service providers into one unified format for use in Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA) or Experience Sampling Methods (ESM). The merging and analysis of objective data (measurements deriving from smartphone sensors) and subjective data (self-reported questionnaires) is also the topic of research by Maxhuni and colleagues [25]. They introduce a combination of techniques\u2014semi-supervised learning, ensemble methods and transfer learning\u2014to build a working model of a subject\u2019s stress merging objective and subjective data. Alfredo Risso and colleagues [26] present a cloud-based mobile system centered on vital-sign monitoring, especially oxygen saturation through SpO2, to support and improve home care for respiratory diseases. One of the major strengths of this system is a design based on patients and their support networks, rather than one that solely offers a medical tool for diagnosis. The work by Mond\u00e9jar and colleagues [27] contributes to the design of serious games for health purposes, particularly in support of the diagnosis and treatment of cognitive-related pathologies, through the identification of videogame mechanics that involve EEG brain activity patterns related to particular cognitive skills. The experiment consists of users playing video games as well as performing traditional psychological assessments. During these tasks, the frontal brain activity was evaluated. Also. Victoria Meza et al. [28] promote the use of neural networks to recognize emotions from brain signals. In the last paper of this section, Monsalve-Torra and colleagues [29] introduce and evaluate the performance of a predictive system dealing with in-hospital mortality for patients who were undergoing repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The authors analyze a number of different machine-learning techniques for prediction in this application, including a multilayer perceptron, a radial basis function and Bayesian networks. 1.3 Prediction and recognition of activities Another key goal of AmI is the direct, natural, and intuitive interaction of users with applications and services embedded in their surrounding environment. In this regard, Llamas and colleagues [30] promote the construction of a collaborative dataset for human gait analysis based on an affordable open-source hardware and software platform based on inertial wearable sensors. The paper also includes a proof-of-concept dataset with sample data from 12 subjects. Gait analysis is also the topic of two additional papers. First, Nieto-Hidalgo and colleagues [31] employ a RGB camera to extract and identify gait features. Their results suggest that this approach not only can determine dynamic parameters (heel strike, toe off, stride length and time) and some skeleton joints, but can also satisfactorily discriminate between normal and abnormal gait. Second, Gonz\u00e1lez and colleagues [32] explore the differences between three quantitative gait analyses: a wearable inertial system that relies on two wireless acceleration sensors mounted on the ankles; a passive vision-based system that externally estimates the measurements through a structured light sensor and 3D point-cloud processing; and a reference clinical instrument. The results discussed in the paper can be considered a preliminary step towards the integration of the different solutions into Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) environments. Finally, the application of a change point detection algorithm to dynamically detect the starting position of windows for the purposes of activity recognition is provided by Ni [33]. Results demonstrate a statistically significant performance gain when using this approach when compared to non-overlapping segmentation methods and 50% overlapping segmentation methods that are commonly used in the literature. 1.4 Methods for monitoring and promoting active aging in the elderly In addition to the previously-discussed contributions of AmI, these technologies can support older adults with homecare assistance and health support in their daily living [7,8]. In agreement with this vision, Bilbao and colleagues [34] present an AAL framework developed within the SONOPA project, whose objective is to promote activity and social engagement in the elderly by combining a social network with information inferred using in-home sensors. The long-term goal of this work is to provide the elders with the possibility to develop new social connections with similar people in order to curb social isolation and promote a healthy social life. Sprint et al. [35] introduce a computational method for detecting and quantifying changes in physical activity patterns. By applying the techniques to wearable sensor data, the technique can determine if new healthy behaviors are being integrated and what additional effects the new patterns have on overall behavior. The technique is used to detect unintentional changes in behavior patterns as well as to validate that new healthy behaviors are being incorporated into a person\u2019s lifestyle. Even if AmI technologies have been identified as a potential aid for the provision of healthcare, not all older adults are well-disposed to adopting technologies and have limited experience using recently-developed technologies. As a result, prior to deploying new technologies, it is critical to evaluate their potential success and acceptance. In their paper, Chaurasia and colleagues [36] present an adoption model built using a set of features - such as physical, environmental and social perspectives - extracted from an older adult\u2019s background. The model achieved an average prediction accuracy of 92.48% when tested on 173 participants. Finally, in a methodological review paper, Danielsen and colleagues [37] identify what information is relevant for performing fall risk assessment and prevention using wearable sensors in a daily living environment. Based on their review, they introduce a Fall Risk Awareness Protocol describing how awareness of the elderly can be altered using wearable sensors in combination with other data that represent context. 2 Conclusions The papers in this special issue present a snapshot of the current empirical and theoretical work on the infrastructure, methods and technology required for achieving AmI in health. As their results clearly demonstrate, the growing AmI research is helping to lay a strong foundation for the creation of an integrated AmI landscape that is able to effectively support health care. It is our hope that the articles presented here will be a valuable resource that helps researchers to understand the complexity of this field and to provide an excellent starting point for advances in the development of improved and accepted AmI systems. Through continued research efforts such as those presented in this special issue, the future of AmI in health care will be bright, with the potential to enhance health care dramatically. Future work will face many remaining challenges, including user acceptance, ergonomics, security, intelligence design, ethics, and required organizational changes in the structure of health services.
