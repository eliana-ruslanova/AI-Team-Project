Main Text Benign vs. Malignant Genomes Matthew Meyerson Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Broad Institute of Harvard & MIT Cancer is a disease of the genome. Cancers harbor multiple alterations in oncogene and tumor suppressor gene sequences, in DNA structures, and in gene and chromosome copy number. But which features of cancer genomes make them cancers, and which features are instead compatible with benign growth? The statistical comparison of large numbers of normal and cancer genomes has revealed a wide array of recurrent somatic genome alterations that are specific for cancer genomes. Functional analyses can help identify genome alterations that promote unrestricted cell growth. However, when we look at the genomes of benign neoplasms or pre-neoplastic states on one hand and malignant neoplasms on the other hand, we cannot discern which genomic features distinguish these two types of cells, although these differences have vastly different implications for patients. The problem we are facing in part is a problem of statistical power\u2014we do not yet have enough genome or exome sequences of pre-cancerous lesions. More importantly, we are facing a problem of separating signal from noise. We may therefore benefit from the development of unique mathematical or data processing approaches to pinpoint the key gene alterations that determine whether aberrant cell growth will cause a cancer or a benign neoplasm. This is an important problem where systems biology approaches may help solve a long-standing mystery in cancer research and medicine. Cancer: An Evolving System Nuria L\u00f3pez-Bigas ICREA, Institute for Research in Biomedicine Barcelona Cancer is an evolving system that follows a Darwinian evolution, characterized by variation (at the time of each cell division some mutations appear in the DNA) and selection (some of these mutations may confer a selective advantage to the cell and become cancer driver mutations). Accurate statistical approaches are required to understand the evolutionary dynamics of cancer and particularly to measure the levels of positive and negative selection in the genome. The interaction of tumor cells with their microenvironment may also be studied through mathematical models. Understanding, for instance, tumor dynamics in the advent of chemotherapy, identifying the mutations involved in resistance, and being able to predict the likelihood that any given tumor develops resistance to a treatment are of great clinical importance. In addition, finding the genomic determinants (also called biomarkers) of cancer prognosis or treatment response is one of the major areas of research in cancer. Often, this involves integrating large datasets with multi-omics information and clinical parameters of patients in clinical trials or pre-clinical models. Machine learning or statistical approaches are needed to convert this multi-dimensional data into useful predictive models. Pre-cancer: Live with It? Nicholas Navin MD Anderson Cancer Center Why do some pre-malignant cancers remain dormant for the life-time of a patient, while others become invasive and cause morbidity? This enigmatic question remains poorly understood in most early-stage cancers, and consequently, many patients are faced with the difficult decision of whether to intervene with therapy or alternatively elect active surveillance with no intervention. Invasion is a complex evolutionary process that involves not only the tumor cells, but also interactions with the stromal and immune cell types and the physical properties of the microenvironment (e.g., mechanical stress, physical barriers, thermodynamics). To understand invasion, we will need multi-omic profiling at single-cell genomic resolution with spatial context and measurements of physical properties. Currently, these technologies do not exist, and their development will necessitate close interdisciplinary collaborations between engineers, researchers, and clinicians. Novel mathematical models and machine-learning approaches that integrate all of the genomic and physical parameters will be needed to understand which features can predict invasion. While clearly an ambitious endeavor, the potential impact of this work is tremendous. It may lead to accurate predictions of which early-stage cancer patients can avoid unnecessary treatments and their associated side-effects. Cancer Speaks in Epigenetics Andrew Feinberg Johns Hopkins University Systems biology fundamentally challenges determinism, as Denis Noble taught us, and we still do not fully appreciate the role of stochasticity in cancer genesis and progression. I have argued for many years that cancer is a disease of epigenetic instability, driven by the environment (e.g., diet, carcinogens) and by mutations that disrupt epigenetic modifiers of genes governing pluripotency. Recent theoretical and experimental work supports the idea that the epigenome encodes the regulation of entropy, as well as mean gene expression. Indeed, this entropy could represent the mathematical equivalent of biological pluripotency, an idea not included in Waddington\u2019s original framework of an epigenetic landscape governed entirely by gene sequence. The degree of \u201cchance\u201d thought to govern the accumulation of mutational hits in cancer may itself be titrated by exposures that promote epigenetic variability, such as carcinogens and inflammation. Most cancers take decades to develop, yet little research in either humans or model organisms is focused on this process. Moreover, new data suggest that cancer progression and metastasis involve selection of epigenetic clones arising stochastically and providing a selective advantage in the host. Systems biology has the perfect tools to approach the integration of genes and the environment throughout this process, particularly given that cancer can be viewed as the paradigmatic disease of programmed stochasticity gone awry. Modeling for Treatment Kornelia Polyak Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School One of the most challenging issues in oncology is designing rational combination therapies individualized to a particular patient at a specific stage of the disease. Dosing and sequence of drugs can determine treatment outcomes, but such decisions are almost never based on clinical or experimental data. This is in part due to the complexity of designing such trials. Even in experimental systems, the number of combinations feasible for testing is very limited compared to all the possibilities. In metastatic patients, lesions may differ from one another and from the primary tumor due to tumor heterogeneity. But until recently, treatment decisions were based on testing the primary tumor, and metastatic samples were rarely analyzed. Mathematics and artificial intelligence could enable this analysis by modeling tumor growth, metastasis, and treatment responses. Multiple combinations, dosing, and sequence of drugs can be tested rather quickly in silico to define the course of treatment with the highest probability of success. To be meaningful, in silico models require development and continuous improvement with the input of experimental data, such as single-cell molecular profiles (preferably from both clinical and preclinical samples) acquired before, during, and after treatment in responders and non-responders. However, I believe that in the not-so-distant future, there will be apps to run such simulations and help design the best course of treatment based on the information available. Understanding Pathogenesis Robert A. Weinberg Whitehead Institute, MIT At present, our understanding of the observed behavior of human tumors is held back by two profound problems that have long resisted resolution and are likely to continue to do so in the foreseeable future. First, the interactions of the cancer cell genome with the epigenetic programs operating within individual cancer cells are poorly understood. While many have embraced the sequencing of cancer cell genomes, which can now be accomplished with facility and precision, the insights conferred by the resulting sequences alone on cancer cell biology are ultimately limited. Distinguishable phenotypes of cancer cells\u2014including those associated with differentiation programs inherited from normal cells-of-origin and processes activated during the course of tumor progression, such as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition\u2014are largely, if not entirely, controlled by epigenetic programs. We simply don't know how to integrate the genetically templated and epigenetically regulated programs to predict overall cancer cell behavior. Second, we are still far away from being able to understand and predict the behavior of individual tumor cells in terms of the cell-surface proteins and intracellular signal-processing circuitry that govern their behavior. This represents an even more daunting task, given the numbers and intrinsic properties of individual signal-processing proteins within individual cells. Those who promise to predict this behavior are whistling in the wind and will be for many years to come. Cancer: The Mixer of Programs Andre Levchenko Yale University At once daunting, fascinating, macabre, and inspiring, cancer is, above all, a systems problem par excellence. Within the well-honed and balanced system of our body, cancer may emerge as a new system with features of both host and parasite, capable of establishing its own connections within its organs of origin or at distant locations. Cancers are fantastically complex and capable of learning new programs and algorithms not available to their cells of origin. Melanocytes do not undergo uncontrolled growth, nor do they invade into the dermis and the bloodstream. They do not move, nor should they. But melanoma cells excel at all this and more. They are Hogwarts students getting access to a restricted library section where they can learn new magic they are not supposed to know. Looser epigenetic control, genetic perturbations, and fluctuating environmental inputs can allow cancer cells access to genetic programs coding for new cell-cell interactions, escape from immune responses, dormancy, and metastatic outbreaks. With an unrestrained genome at their disposal, cells can become anything and travel anywhere. Understanding the power of genomes gone awry requires the context of analyzing the intricate organization and control of both the cancer cells themselves and their interactions with the surrounding tissues, frequently under the severe pressures imposed by various therapies. I do not know of an approach other than systems biology that can enable this analysis. Importantly, systems biology itself may be redefined and reborn as a truly integrative science when faced with a challenge as awesome and formidable as cancer. Transforming Diagnostics Elaine Mardis Nationwide Children's Hospital, Ohio State University College of Medicine The intersection of cancer research and physical sciences has great potential for advances due to the application of mathematics (mainly algorithmic approaches) that integrate multiple large-scale \u201comics\u201d datasets from different tumor types. Applying artificial intelligence to identify activation and inactivation of cellular pathways in different cancers or to predict cancer outcomes from genomic factors may simplify the use of genomic data for all oncologists. Other mathematical approaches, based on evolutionary studies, can be applied to genomic data from patient-matched primary and metastatic tumors. Quantitative comparison of metastases that occupy different tissues can define the evolutionary pressure that resulted in their outgrowth (e.g., resistance to therapies), elucidate progression from primary to metastatic disease, and inform how to prevent it. Engineering and math also form the basis of single-cell approaches, which can be used to investigate intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, evaluate the immune microenvironment of a cancer before and after immunotherapies, isolate and analyze circulating tumor cells from body fluids, or generate high-dimensional datasets of protein signatures with instruments such as CyToF. Such rapid technological advancement highlights the need to apply statistical methods to develop best practices and standardization of measurements, evaluate reproducibility, and devise quality assurance metrics. Data sharing and open source distribution of code will provide cancer-specific datasets for testing new approaches, which multiple end users can evaluate and improve. Taken together, these principles will broaden the adoption of cancer data analytics for diagnostics and ensure the success of precision cancer medicine for the benefit of all patients. Cancer Cell Identity Vito Quaranta Vanderbilt University School of Medicine These are exciting times in cancer research. However, the enormous amount of data now at our disposal is taking the amorphous shape of a boundless ocean. How do we integrate into coherent, meaningful vignettes the many types of data produced by cancer geneticists, molecular and cell biologists, physician scientists, clinicians, and epidemiologists, among others? The holistic nature of systems biology is a natural fit for this daunting task, but its effective implementation does not happen automatically. The challenge for systems biologists is finding the right mixture of theoretical and experimental tools to answer a systems-level question. As a complex adaptive system evolving over multiple biological and temporal scales in response to perturbations and treatment, cancer evokes many questions. But what question would make the most difference if answered? Unquestionably, it is the question of cancer cell identity. More generally, how do we best and most usefully define the identity of a single cancer cell? Key features might include responsiveness to treatment, propensity for emergence of a resistant phenotype in a population, or how a cell\u2019s shapeshifter phenotype relates to its (epi)genetics. Systems biologists must join forces across disciplines (computation, mathematics, physics, statistics, artificial intelligence, engineering) to build theoretical models of cancer cell identity useful to frame the breadth of existing data and guide further experimentation. If so, cancer systems biology will go beyond \u201cfinding the cure\u201d and make far-reaching contributions, given that the relationship between genotype and phenotype is, arguably, the central issue of biology in the 21st century.", "scopus-id": "85044108451", "pubmed-id": "29596779", "coredata": {"eid": "1-s2.0-S2405471218301017", "dc:description": null, "openArchiveArticle": "true",
