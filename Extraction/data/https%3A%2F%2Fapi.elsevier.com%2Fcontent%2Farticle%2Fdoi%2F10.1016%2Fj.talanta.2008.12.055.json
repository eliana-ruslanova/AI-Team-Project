It is based on a dynamic response of sensor array with the emphasis on the processing of discrete measurement data. The information needed for identification of test samples is obtained in course of profiling the data from calibration measurements. This operation consists of the following steps: classification of data sets, selection of representative data sets, parameterization of classifiers associated with representative data sets and determination of data records. In our work Discriminant Function Analysis was used for data classification. The information saved in data record describes: the sequential number of discrete measurement, combination of gas sensors in this measurement which are best for classification of calibration samples, and the parameters of associated classifier. They are identifiers of gas class. The procedure of data record determination itself is time consuming. However this operation will be performed only at the stage of the development of the measurement instrument and when its malfunction is diagnosed. The routine use of the instrument will be restricted to gas identification task, which only utilizes the results of profiling.\n                  The identification of unknown gas is performed on the base of data records and measurement data obtained for this gas. Data records guide the preparation of data sets, separately for each class of gases. These data sets are used as input of the discriminant functions which have parameter values also indicated by data records. It was shown in the present contribution, that the qualitative identification of nine test gas samples (vapors of ethanol, acetic acid and ethyl acetate in air) with our method was very accurate and fast.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Gas sensor"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Transient response"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Classification"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Volatile organic compounds"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0039914009000071", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039914009000071", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "61449140038", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-61449140038", "pubmed-id": "19269438", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/61449140038", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20090115", "$": "2009-01-15"}}}}}
