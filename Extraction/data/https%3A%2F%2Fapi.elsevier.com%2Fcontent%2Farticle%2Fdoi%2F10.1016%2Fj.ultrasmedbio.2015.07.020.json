Two independent feature sets consisting of visual features based on a radiologist's interpretation of images and computer-extracted features when used as first and second readers and combined by adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) and a pruning classifier resulted in a very high level of diagnostic performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve\u00a0= 0.98) at a cost of pruning a fraction (20%) of the cases for further evaluation by independent methods. AdaBoost also improved the diagnostic performance of the individual human observers and increased the agreement between their analyses. Pairing AdaBoost with selective pruning is a principled methodology for achieving high diagnostic performance without the added cost of an additional reader for differentiating solid breast masses by ultrasound.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Breast ultrasound"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Breast cancer"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Adaptive boosting"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Computer-aided diagnosis"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial intelligence"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0301562915004664", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301562915004664", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84947486716", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84947486716", "pubmed-id": "26354997", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84947486716", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20150906", "$": "2015-09-06"}}}}}
