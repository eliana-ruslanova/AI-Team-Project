However, the collaborations among hospitals, research institutes and enterprises are insufficient at the present, and there are various issues in technological transformation and value landing of products in this area. To solve the core problems in the developmental path of medical imaging AI, the Chinese Innovative Alliance of Industry, Education, Research and Application of Artificial Intelligence for Medical Imaging compiled the White Paper on Medical Image AI in China. This article introduces the current status of collaboration, the clinical demands for medical imaging AI technique, and the key points in AI technology transformation: robustness, usability and security. We are facing challenges of lacking industry standards, data desensitization standard, assessment system, as well as corresponding regulations and policies to realize the application values of AI products in medical imaging. Further development of AI in medical imaging requires breakthroughs of the core algorithm, deep involvement of doctors, input from capitals, patience from societies, and most importantly, the resolutions from government for multiple difficulties in links of landing the technology.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "medical imaging"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "artificial intelligence"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "white paper"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "innovative alliance"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S100192941930029X", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S100192941930029X", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85068870378", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85068870378", "pubmed-id": "31315748", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85068870378", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20190715", "$": "2019-07-15"}}}}}
