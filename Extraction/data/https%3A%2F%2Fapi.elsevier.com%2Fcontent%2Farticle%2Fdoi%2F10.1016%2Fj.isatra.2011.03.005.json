The method includes solving a polynomial equation on the basis of the chosen characteristic polynomial using the Manabe standard polynomial form and parametric solutions. Parametric solutions are introduced directly into the structure of the servo controller. On the basis of the chosen parametric solutions the robustness of a closed-loop system is assessed through uncertainty models and assessment of the norm \n                        \n                           \n                              \n                                 \u2016\n                                 \u2022\n                                 \u2016\n                              \n                           \n                           \n                              \u221e\n                           \n                        \n                     .
