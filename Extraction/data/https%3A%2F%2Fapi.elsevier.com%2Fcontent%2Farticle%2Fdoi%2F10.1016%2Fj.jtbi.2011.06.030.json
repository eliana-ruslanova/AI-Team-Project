Firstly, statistical analysis was performed on the sum of \u03b2-strands between each \u03b2-strand pairs in protein sequences. The results showed a propensity of near-neighbor pairing (or called \u201cfirst come first pair\u201d) in the \u03b2-strand pairs. Secondly, based on the same dataset, the pairwise cross-combinations of real \u03b2-strand pairs and four pseudo-\u03b2-strand contained pairs were classified by support vector machine (SVM). A novel feature extracting approach was designed for classification using the average amino acid pairing encoding matrix (APEM). Analytical results of the classification indicated that a segment of \u03b2-strand had the ability to distinguish \u03b2-strands from segments of \u03b1-helix and coil. However, the result also showed that a \u03b2-strand was not strongly conserved to choose its real partner from all the alternative \u03b2-strand partners, which was corresponding with the ordination results of the statistical analysis each other. Thus, the rules of \u201cfirst come first pair\u201d propensity and the non-conservative ability to choose real partner, were possible important factors affecting the \u03b2-strands alignment forming \u03b2-sheet structures.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Protein folding"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "\u03b2-Sheet formation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Amino acid pairs"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Machine learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Support vector machine"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519311003353", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519311003353", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "79960326636", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-79960326636", "pubmed-id": "21745480", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79960326636", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20110702", "$": "2011-07-02"}}}}}
