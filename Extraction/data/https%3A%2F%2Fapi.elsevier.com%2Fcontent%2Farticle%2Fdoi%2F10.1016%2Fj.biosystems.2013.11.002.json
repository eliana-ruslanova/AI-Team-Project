As a mechanism to handle the exploration\u2013exploitation dilemma in reinforcement learning, the loosely symmetric (LS) value function that models causal intuition of humans was proposed (Shinohara et al., 2007). While LS shows the highest correlation with causal induction by humans, it has been reported that it effectively works in multi-armed bandit problems that form the simplest class of tasks representing the dilemma. However, the scope of application of LS was limited to the reinforcement learning problems that have K actions with only one state (K-armed bandit problems). This study proposes LS-Q learning architecture that can deal with general reinforcement learning tasks with multiple states and delayed reward. We tested the learning performance of the new architecture in giant-swing robot motion learning, where uncertainty and unknown-ness of the environment is huge. In the test, the help of ready-made internal models or functional approximation of the state space were not given. The simulations showed that while the ordinary Q-learning agent does not reach giant-swing motion because of stagnant loops (local optima with low rewards), LS-Q escapes such loops and acquires giant-swing. It is confirmed that the smaller number of states is, in other words, the more coarse-grained the division of states and the more incomplete the state observation is, the better LS-Q performs in comparison with Q-learning. We also showed that the high performance of LS-Q depends comparatively little on parameter tuning and learning time. This suggests that the proposed method inspired by human cognition works adaptively in real environments.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Q-learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Exploration\u2013exploitation dilemma"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Bio-inspired computing"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Cognitive bias"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Loosely symmetric model"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Acrobot"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Multi-armed bandit problems"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S030326471300230X", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030326471300230X", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84890947551", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84890947551", "pubmed-id": "24296286", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84890947551", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20131201", "$": "2013-12-01"}}}}}
