We describe a cognitive robotics model in which the linguistic input provided by the experimenter guides the autonomous organization of the robot\u2019s knowledge. In this model, sequences of linguistic inputs lead to the development of higher-order concepts grounded on basic concepts and actions. In particular, we show that higher-order symbolic representations can be indirectly grounded in action primitives directly grounded in sensorimotor experiences. The use of recurrent neural network also permits the learning of higher-order concepts based on temporal sequences of action primitives. Hence, the meaning of a higher-order concept is obtained through the combination of basic sensorimotor knowledge. We argue that such a hierarchical organization of concepts can be a possible account for the acquisition of abstract words in cognitive robots.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Symbol grounding"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Abstract language"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Computational modelling"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Recurrent neural network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Developmental cognitive robotics"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S089360801200041X", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089360801200041X", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84861766092", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84861766092", "pubmed-id": "22386502", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84861766092", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20120214", "$": "2012-02-14"}}}}}
