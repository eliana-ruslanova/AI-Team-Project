Universit\u00e9 Paris 5-Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9 Place de l\u2019Od\u00e9on Paris 75005 France In any monthly journal, the January issue is traditionally devoted to saying goodbye to the previous year and welcoming the new one. January is the time of well-intended resolutions for the coming year. For many of us, these resolutions include quitting smoking, losing weight, eating less (or in a healthier way), not being late at meetings, eliminating procrastination, writing more scientific papers than last year, and so on. These well-intended resolutions depend on the context, the cultural background, and many other individual variables. As Editor-in-Chief, I have identified resolutions that I will try to achieve. One resolution is to speed up the editorial handling process and the turnaround of submissions. As an author myself, I know how keen authors are to have their accepted papers rapidly published. However, the delay between first submission and final display depends on several parameters, including the duration of revision by authors. During 2018, Diagnostic and Interventional Imaging has received a total of 440 papers submitted for potential publication. Of these, 124 were ultimately published, yielding an acceptance rate of 28.2%. Among the 124 published papers, 55 (44.4%) were original articles, and 57 (46%) were written by authors from abroad. The selection of the best articles has been made possible by the outstanding work of a panel of reviewers. In the era of artificial intelligence, the review of submitted manuscripts is still performed by human beings, but who knows? In a near future, it may be possible that scientific papers will be written by writing machines and reviewed by reviewing machines, all driven by computer programs. This raises complicated questions; for example, should the computer programs be developed by the same company, and if so, how would conflict of interest issues be handled? Perhaps by a conflict of interest handling program. Like many of my colleagues, I am fascinated by artificial intelligence. In the field of radiology, it is currently predicted that artificial intelligence will help radiologists spend less time with routine tasks and have more time for more pleasant and enriching activities [1,2]. This spared time could thus be devoted to human contact with patients, practicing interventional radiology, teaching, academic research and\u2026 writing and submitting papers to Diagnostic and Interventional Imaging [2]. I am very pleased to wish you an excellent 2019 in this Editorial that was written entirely by me. Let's hope that published papers will continue to be read by humans. But who knows\u2026 Disclosure of interest The author declares that he has no competing interest.
