However, letters written by genetic counselors also employ strategies to help clients cope. The objectives of this research were to discover methods for addition of coping-related strategies to the drafts and to explore their efficacy.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  Using an argumentation-based approach, the system design was modified to add coping-related strategies used by actual genetic counselors. An evaluation of computer-produced drafts was performed comparing those containing only biomedical arguments to those with coping strategies added to biomedical arguments.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  The evaluation mainly found no significant impact of adding coping strategies.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion\n                  The main contribution of this work was to show how coping-related strategies can be produced by an artificial intelligence approach within an argumentation-based theoretical framework. A possible future application would be to improve computer-drafted genetic counseling patient letters.\n               \n               \n                  Practice implications\n                  Computer-assisted drafting of letters has potential to aid in the practice of genetic counseling. Further research is needed to demonstrate the efficacy of adding coping strategies to computer-produced drafts.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Genetic counseling patient letters"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Coping"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial intelligence"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Argumentation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Evidence-based medicine"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0738399113001808", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738399113001808", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84880326937", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84880326937", "pubmed-id": "23726747", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84880326937", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20130529", "$": "2013-05-29"}}}}}
