Abstract Tissue engineers are often confused on finding the most successful strategy for specific patient. In this study, we used artificial neural networks to predict the outcomes of different vascular tissue engineering strategies, thus providing advisory information for experimental designers. Over 30 variables were used as features of the tissue engineering strategies. Different architectures of artificial neural networks with back propagation algorithm were tested to obtain the best model configuration for the prediction of the tissue engineering strategies. In the computational experiments, the artificial neural networks with one and two hidden layers could, respectively, detect unsuccessful strategies with the highest predictive accuracy of 91.45 and 94.24%. In conclusion, artificial intelligence has great potential in tissue engineering decision support. It can provide accurate advisory information for tissue engineers, thus reducing failures and improving therapeutic effects. Keywords Tissue engineering Decision support Artificial neural networks 1 Introduction Coronary and peripheral vascular diseases represent a growing health and socio-economic burden in most developed countries [1,2]. Surgical bypass with vein remains the majority of treatment [3,4]. However, usable vein is often absent [5,6]. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) and Dacron (polyethylene terephtalate fibre) are the most widely used synthetic materials. Although successful in large diameter (>5mm) high-flow vessels, in low flow or smaller diameter sites they are compromised by both thrombogenicity and compliance mismatch [7,8]. Tissue engineering represents a promising concept of applying the principles and methods of engineering and biology to develop functional tissue for surgical replacement [9]. Initial attempts to create tissue-engineered blood vessels resulted in the manufacturing of grafts with poor mechanical properties [10,11]. Dynamic mechanical conditioning had dramatically improved the mechanical properties of tissue-engineered blood vessels. Still, many challenges remain and are currently being addressed, particularly with regard to thrombogenicity and the improvement of graft mechanical properties in a limited period. When a tissue engineering strategy is appropriate for specific patient, the result is often satisfying. However, the determination of strategies for vascular tissue engineering can be very complicated. As the seed cells, scaffolds, growth factors, bioreactor setting, and operation methods are all highly variable, there can be numerous strategies for specific patient. But which is the most appropriate? No one can answer this question. Although informatics has been applied in the course of scaffold design and biomimetic modeling [12,13], no informatics tool has been developed for the determination of tissue engineering strategies. In this study, we used artificial neural networks to provide advisory information for tissue engineering experiment designers. The dataset was based on experimental records, and 36 variables were established to describe the features of tissue engineering strategies. Artificial neural networks with back propagation algorithm were trained and then used to predict the outcomes of vascular tissue engineering strategies. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Vascular tissue engineering strategy One tissue engineering strategy includes many experimental processes, which are basic for extracting features to predict the experimental result. As an example, one strategy for tissue engineered canine carotid (with smooth muscle cells, allogenic acelluarized matrix, and perfusion bioreactor) can be described below: Carotid smooth muscle cells were isolated from the canine saphenous vein and used at low passage to seed on the acelluarized matrix of allogenic canine carotids. Acellularized matrix of carotid arteries were obtained by a 0.25% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA solution for 176h, secondary to be freeze-dried, and then used fibronectin as lining. The smooth muscle cells were seeded both through the lumen and on the external surface by a dual syringe pump under dynamic conditions. After 24h of static culture, the construct was mounted in the bioreactor for mechanical stimulation. The pulsatile flow in the construct was started with a peak pressure of 25mmHg and a trough pressure of 10mmHg. In the second week, the pressure was increased to 60/35mmHg; and in the third week, the pressure was set at 120/70mmHg. The flow rates inside and outside the constructs were, respectively, kept at 45ml/min and 4ml/h. The construct was cultured for 21 days in the bioreactor and implanted in the dog. After 2 months, the experimental result was examined. If the carotid is fully reconstructed (with normal histological and mechanical properties, without thrombus), the result is \u201csuccessful.\u201d As for other strategies, the experimental processes (e.g., seed cells, scaffolds, growth factors, bioreactor setting, and operation methods) may be different. 2.2 Data preparation The experimental records for canine carotid tissue engineering was provided by the Tissue Engineering Laboratory of Harbin Medical University (founded in 1998), and altogether 36 variables were used as features of the recipients, the tissue engineering strategies and the results (Table 1 ). The dataset includes 450 dogs treated with tissue-engineered carotids. The variable \u201cResult\u201d denoted the outcomes of tissue engineering strategies, and other 35 variables were selected as features of dogs and tissue engineering strategies. Before ANNs and decision trees were trained, a 1-of-C encoding (one binary variable per class) was applied to the nominal attributes with few different values. For example, the scaffold of polyglycolic acid polymer, collagen gel, and polyurethane were denoted with 001, 010, and 100. The \u201cResult\u201d variable was denoted with 0 and 1, according to the scheme: successful reconstruction (with normal histological and mechanical properties, without thrombus)\u21920 (negative); failed reconstruction (with abnormal histological or mechanical properties, or with thrombus)\u21921 (positive). Because the numerical variables have very different orders of magnitude, they were rescaled to be included within the interval [0,1] by using the following equation: (1) V n = V o - V min V max - V min in which V o and V n are, respectively, the old and new value of the variable, V min and V max are the minimum and maximum values of that variable in the original dataset. In this work, three accuracy measures were used: the true positive rate (PR), also known as sensitivity, the true negative rate (NR), also known as specificity, and the predictive accuracy (PA), which gives an overall evaluation. The accuracy measures can be computed with True Positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) as following: (2) PR = TP FN + TP \u00d7 100 ( % ) , NR = TN TN + FP \u00d7 100 ( % ) , PA = TN + TP TN + FP + FN + TP \u00d7 100 ( % ) . A cross-validation method (K-fold cross-validation) was used to prepare training and test datasets. The 450 records were randomly cut into five (i.e., K =5) parts, with four of five parts used as training data and the remaining part used as test data each time. For example, for the first set, parts one to four were used for the training data and part five for test data; and for the second set, part one, two, three, and five were used for training data and part four for test data, and so on. The final predictive accuracy (PA) was the average of the five test samples. Standard deviations (SD) of the five test samples were also showed. The dataset was randomly cut for 20 times, and each time a cross-validation was implemented. The PA with the smallest SD best indicated the performance of the classifier. In the statistical analysis, a value of P <0.05 was accepted as significant. 2.3 Artificial neural networks The artificial neural networks (ANNs) with back propagation algorithm has been utilized in most of the neural networks applications [14\u201316]. In this study, different neural network architectures were tested to obtain the best model configuration for the prediction of the tissue engineering strategies. The modeling method was based on the principles of the backpropagation algorithm (Rumelhart et al., 1986) [17]. A backpropagation network typically comprises three types of neuron layers: an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer each including one or several neurons. As shown in Fig. 1 , nodes from one layer are connected to all nodes in the following layer, but no lateral connections within any layer, nor feed-back connections are possible. We compared the predictive accuracy of ANNs that had different hidden layers, neuron numbers, and training epochs. The computational test was carried out with one widely available commercial software program (Matlab). 3 Results In the cross-validation procedure (which was carried 20 times in this study), the classification model was more precise as the standard deviation becomes smaller. Thus, the performance of specific classifier was denoted by predictive accuracy with the smallest standard deviation. As shown in Table 2 , the artificial neural networks with two hidden layers performed better and achieved the predictive accuracy of 94.24%, which was significantly higher than that of artificial neural networks with one hidden layer (t test, P <0.05). 3.1 Optimization of the artificial neural networks with one hidden layer The predictive accuracy varied with the number of hidden neurons and the maximum training epochs (as shown in Table 3 and Fig. 2 ). After experimental trails, the number of hidden neurons was set to 8, being the maximum number of epochs set to 4000. The resultant predictive accuracy was 91.45% (the highest in all groups), and the relevant sensitivity (PR) and specificity (NR) were, respectively, 92.37 and 90.71%. 3.2 Optimization of the artificial neural networks with two hidden layers Neural networks with different training epochs and different numbers of neurons in the first and second hidden layers were, respectively, validated. The numbers of neurons in the two hidden layers all ranged from 2 to 8, resulting in 49 network architectures. The most appropriate training epoch for specific architecture was searched in the range of 2000\u201320,000. After experimental trails, a neural network with, respectively, 6 and 3 neurons in the first and second hidden layers achieved the highest predictive accuracy of 94.24% (as shown in Table 4 and Fig. 3 ). The training epoch was set to 13,000, and the relevant sensitivity (PR) and specificity (NR) were, respectively, 95.08 and 93.56%. 4 Discussion and conclusions Although tissue engineering progressed rapidly in the past 20 years, tissue engineers are often very confused on finding the most appropriate strategy for specific patient. Unfortunately, no decision support system has been developed to solve this problem, leaving the adoption of strategies at the discretion of experiment designers. Safety and effectiveness have been the biggest hurdles in the clinical application of tissue engineered products (especially the vessels). Thus, there is an urgent need for methods of determination in vascular tissue engineering. In this study, we have used artificial neural networks to predict the outcomes of different vascular tissue engineering strategies. In the computational experiments, the artificial neural networks with two hidden layers could identify improper strategies with the predictive accuracy of 94.24%. Thus, a prompt alarm could be given to tissue engineers before the improper strategy really run failed. The high predictive accuracy of artificial neural networks may due to its capability of generalization of nonlinearly separable problems. This work has proved that artificial intelligence has great potential in tissue engineering decision support. It can provide accurate advisory information for tissue engineers, thus reducing failures and improving therapeutic effects. In contrast to human intelligence, the artificial intelligent system can study larger dataset and make more precise decision. Artificial intelligence can effectively reduce the risk of tissue engineering, and thus, hopefully, making tissue engineering accepted earlier by the medical market. In future research, we plan to predict the strategies for other tissue types (e.g., skin, tendon, and cornea), thus raveling the applicability of this method in the whole realm. Another interesting direction is based in the use of further data mining tools on more species, especially human being. References [1] S. Ounpuu S. Anand S.

In this study, we used artificial neural networks to predict the outcomes of different vascular tissue engineering strategies, thus providing advisory information for experimental designers. Over 30 variables were used as features of the tissue engineering strategies. Different architectures of artificial neural networks with back propagation algorithm were tested to obtain the best model configuration for the prediction of the tissue engineering strategies. In the computational experiments, the artificial neural networks with one and two hidden layers could, respectively, detect unsuccessful strategies with the highest predictive accuracy of 91.45 and 94.24%. In conclusion, artificial intelligence has great potential in tissue engineering decision support. It can provide accurate advisory information for tissue engineers, thus reducing failures and improving therapeutic effects.", "openArchiveArticle": "true", "prism:coverDate": "2005-12-31", "openaccessUserLicense": "http://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/", "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1532046405000316", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Xu, Jie"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Ge, Haiyan"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Zhou, Xiaolin"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Yan, Jinglong"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Chi, Qiang"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Zhang, Zhipeng"}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1532046405000316"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046405000316"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": "Full", "pii": "S1532-0464(05)00031-6", "prism:volume": "38", "prism:publisher": "Elsevier Inc.", "dc:title": "Prediction of vascular tissue engineering results with artificial neural networks", "prism:copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Inc.
