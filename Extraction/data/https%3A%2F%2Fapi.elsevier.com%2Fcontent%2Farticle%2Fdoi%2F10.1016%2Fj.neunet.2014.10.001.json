In this review, we aim to report the current state of the theoretical research and practical advances on this subject. We first give an overview of ELM from the theoretical perspective, including the interpolation theory, universal approximation capability, and generalization ability. Then we focus on the various improvements made to ELM which further improve its stability, sparsity and accuracy under general or specific conditions. Apart from classification and regression, ELM has recently been extended for clustering, feature selection, representational learning and many other learning tasks. These newly emerging algorithms greatly expand the applications of ELM. From implementation aspect, hardware implementation and parallel computation techniques have substantially sped up the training of ELM, making it feasible for big data processing and real-time reasoning. Due to its remarkable efficiency, simplicity, and impressive generalization performance, ELM have been applied in a variety of domains, such as biomedical engineering, computer vision, system identification, and control and robotics. In this review, we try to provide a comprehensive view of these advances in ELM together with its future perspectives.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Extreme learning machine"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Classification"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Clustering"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Feature learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Regression"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608014002214", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608014002214", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84908682236", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84908682236", "pubmed-id": "25462632", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84908682236", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20141016", "$": "2014-10-16"}}}}}
