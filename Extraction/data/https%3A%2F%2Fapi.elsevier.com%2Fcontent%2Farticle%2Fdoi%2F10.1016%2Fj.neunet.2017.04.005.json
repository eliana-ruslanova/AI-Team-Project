Using matrix completion methods to recover missing entries is a common way to solve the problem. Conventional matrix completion methods require that the matrix should be of low-rank intrinsically, but most matrices are of high-rank or even full-rank in practice, especially when the number of subspaces is large. In this paper, a new method called Sparse Representation with Missing Entries and Matrix Completion is proposed to solve the problems of incomplete-data subspace clustering and high-rank matrix completion. The proposed algorithm alternately computes the matrix of sparse representation coefficients and recovers the missing entries of a data matrix. The proposed algorithm recovers missing entries through minimizing the representation coefficients, representation errors, and matrix rank. Thorough experimental study and comparative analysis based on synthetic data and natural images were conducted. The presented results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more effective in subspace clustering and matrix completion compared with other existing methods.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Subspace clustering"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Sparse representation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Missing entries"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "High-rank"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Matrix completion"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608017300850", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608017300850", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85019392282", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85019392282", "pubmed-id": "28531874", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85019392282", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20170425", "$": "2017-04-25"}}}}}
