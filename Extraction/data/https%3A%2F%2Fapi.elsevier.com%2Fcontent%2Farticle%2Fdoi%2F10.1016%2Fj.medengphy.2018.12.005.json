In this AI architecture, ultrasound images were segmented by the reaction diffusion level set model combined with the Gabor-based anisotropic diffusion algorithm. Then morphological features and texture features were extracted from SWE and B-mode ultrasound images at the contourlet domain. Finally, we employed a framework for feature learning and classification with the deep polynomial network (DPN) on dual-modal features to distinguish between malignant and benign breast tumors. With the leave-one-out cross validation, the DPN method on dual-modal features achieved a sensitivity of 97.8%, a specificity of 94.1%, an accuracy of 95.6%, a Youden's index of 91.9% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.961, which was superior to the classic single-modal methods, and the dual-modal methods using the principal component analysis and multiple kernel learning. These results have demonstrated that the dual-modal AI-based technique with DPN has the potential for breast tumor classification in future clinical practice.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Dual-modal diagnosis"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Shear-wave elastography"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "B-mode ultrasound"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Breast tumor"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial intelligence"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Deep polynomial network"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1350453318301747", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350453318301747", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85058664621", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85058664621", "pubmed-id": "30578163", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85058664621", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20181219", "$": "2018-12-19"}}}}}
