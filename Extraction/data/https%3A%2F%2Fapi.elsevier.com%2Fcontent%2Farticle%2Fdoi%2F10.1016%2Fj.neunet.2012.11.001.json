It is an important mechanism for autonomous systems due to the ability of exploiting the already acquired information and for exploring the new knowledge in the learning space at the same time. In these cases, the reliability of the labels is a crucial factor, because mislabeled samples may propagate wrong labels to a portion of or even the entire data set. This paper has the objective of addressing the error propagation problem originated by these mislabeled samples by presenting a mechanism embedded in a network-based (graph-based) semisupervised learning method. Such a procedure is based on a combined random-preferential walk of particles in a network constructed from the input data set. The particles of the same class cooperate among them, while the particles of different classes compete with each other to propagate class labels to the whole network. Computer simulations conducted on synthetic and real-world data sets reveal the effectiveness of the model.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Stochastic competitive learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Semisupervised learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Error propagation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Random walk"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Preferential walk"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Complex networks"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608012002778", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608012002778", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84875894908", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84875894908", "pubmed-id": "23200192", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84875894908", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20121117", "$": "2012-11-17"}}}}}
