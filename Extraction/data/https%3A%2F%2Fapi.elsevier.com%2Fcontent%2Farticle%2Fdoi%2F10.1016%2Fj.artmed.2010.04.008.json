Measurements of movement initiation in isometric conditions are widely used in clinical rehabilitation and their importance in functional assessment has been demonstrated for specific parts of the human body. The determination of the voluntary movement initiation time, also referred to as onset time, represents a challenging issue since the time window characterizing the movement onset is of particular relevance for the understanding of recovery mechanisms after a neurological damage. Establishing it manually as well as a troublesome task may also introduce oversight errors and loss of information.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  The most commonly used methods for automatic onset time detection compare the raw signal, or some extracted measures such as its derivatives (i.e., velocity and acceleration) with a chosen threshold. However, they suffer from high variability and systematic errors because of the weakness of the signal, the abnormality of response profiles as well as the variability of movement initiation times among patients. In this paper, we introduce a technique to optimise onset detection according to each input signal. It is based on a classification system that enables us to establish which deterministic method provides the most accurate onset time on the basis of information directly derived from the raw signal.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  The approach was tested on annotated force and torque datasets. Each dataset is constituted by 768 signals acquired from eight anatomical districts in 96 patients who carried out six tasks related to common daily activities. The results show that the proposed technique improves not only on the performance achieved by each of the deterministic methods, but also on that attained by a group of clinical experts.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  The paper describes a classification system detecting the voluntary movement initiation time and adaptable to different signals. By using a set of features directly derived from raw data, we obtained promising results. Furthermore, although the technique has been developed within the scope of isometric force and torque signal analysis, it can be applied to other detection problems where several simple detectors are available.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Human movement"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Isometric voluntary muscular contraction"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Onset detection"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Pattern recognition"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0933365710000400", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365710000400", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "77955271529", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-77955271529", "pubmed-id": "20510593", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77955271529", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20100526", "$": "2010-05-26"}}}}}
