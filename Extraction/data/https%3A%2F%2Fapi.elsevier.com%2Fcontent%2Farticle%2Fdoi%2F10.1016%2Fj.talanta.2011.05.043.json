The most common type of DNA modification consists of the methylation of cytosine in the CpG dinucleotide. The detections of DNA methylation have been determined mostly by experimental methods; however, these methods were time-consuming, expensive, and difficult to meet the requirements of modern large-scale sequencing technology. Accordingly, it is necessary to develop automatic and reliable prediction methods for DNA methylation.\n                  In this study, the pseudo-trinucleotide composition was proposed, and a novel method was developed by support vector machine (SVM) with the pseudo-trinucleotide composition as input parameter to represent DNA sequence for DNA methylation prediction. The model was evaluated on two datasets, including a dataset of Rollins (dataset_1) and a dataset collected healthy human records from the MethDB database (dataset_2). For dataset_1, the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and accuracy (ACC) by jackknife validation were 0.8051 and 0.6098, respectively. For dataset_2, the MCC and ACC were 0.8500 and 0.7203, respectively. The good prediction results reveal that the pseudo-trinucleotide composition is an effective representation method for DNA sequence and plays a very important role in the prediction of DNA function.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "DNA methylation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Pseudo-trinucleotide composition"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Support vector machine"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0039914011004528", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039914011004528", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "79959925756", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-79959925756", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79959925756", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20110527", "$": "2011-05-27"}}}}}
