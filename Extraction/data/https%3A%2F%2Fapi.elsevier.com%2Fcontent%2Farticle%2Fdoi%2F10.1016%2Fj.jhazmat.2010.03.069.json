The reactor was operated in an aerobic batch and continuous condition with 50% by volume which was filled with light expanded clay aggregate (LECA) as carrier. Efficiency evaluation of the reactors was obtained at different retention time (RT) of 8, 24, 48 and 72h with an influent COD from 100 to 4000mg/L. Exploratory data analysis was used to detect relationships between the data and dependent evaluated one. The appropriate architecture of the neural network models was determined using several steps of training and testing of the models. The ANN-based models were found to provide an efficient and a robust tool in predicting MBBR performance for treating aromatic amine compounds.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Aniline"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "COD"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Moving bed biofilm reactor"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Neural networks"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304389410003754", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389410003754", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "77952889909", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-77952889909", "pubmed-id": "20399558", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77952889909", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20100323", "$": "2010-03-23"}}}}}
