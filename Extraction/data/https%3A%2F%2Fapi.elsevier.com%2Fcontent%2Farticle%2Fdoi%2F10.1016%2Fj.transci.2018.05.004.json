It is a highly desirable academic field of many current fields of studies. Leading AI researchers describe the field as \u201cthe study and design of intelligent agents\u201d. McCarthy invented this term in 1955 and defined it as \u201cthe science and engineering of making intelligent machines\u201d. The central goals of AI research are reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, natural language processing (communication), perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects. In fact the multidisplinary AI field is considered to be rather interdisciplinary covering numerous number of sciences and professions, including computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy and neurosciences. The field was founded on the claim that a central intellectual property of humans, intelligence-the sapience of Homo Sapiens \u201ccan be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it\u201d. This raises philosophical issues about the nature of the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence. Artificial Intelligence has been the subject of tremendous optimism but has also suffered stunning setbacks.\n                  The goal of this narrative is to review the potential use of AI approaches and their integration into pediatric cellular therapies and regenerative medicine. Emphasis is placed on recognition and application of AI techniques in the development of predictive models for personalized treatments with engineered stem cells, immune cells and regenerated tissues in adults and children. These intelligent machines could dissect the whole genome and isolate the immune particularities of individual patient\u2019s disease in a matter of minutes and create the treatment that is customized to patient\u2019s genetic specificity and immune system capability. AI techniques could be used for optimization of clinical trials of innovative stem cell and gene therapies in pediatric patients by precise planning of treatments, predicting clinical outcomes, simplifying recruitment and retention of patients, learning from input data and applying to new data, thus lowering their complexity and costs. Complementing human intelligence with machine intelligence could have an exponentially high impact on continual progress in many fields of pediatrics. However how long before we could see the real impact still remains the big question. The most pertinent question that remains to be answered therefore, is can AI effectively and accurately predict properties of newer DDR strategies?\n                  The goal of this article is to review the use of AI method for cellular therapy and regenerative medicine and emphasize its potential to further the progress in these fields of medicine.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial intelligence"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Computational science"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Computational algorithm"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Cancer"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Immune therapy"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Regenerative medicine"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473050218301721", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473050218301721", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85047095825", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85047095825", "pubmed-id": "29784537", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85047095825", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20180509", "$": "2018-05-09"}}}}}
