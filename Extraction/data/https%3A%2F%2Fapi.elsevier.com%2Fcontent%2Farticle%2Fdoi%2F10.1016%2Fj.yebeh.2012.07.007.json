The algorithm computes the eigenspectra of space\u2013delay correlation and covariance matrices from 15\u2010s blocks of EEG data at multiple delay scales. The principal components of these features are used to classify the patient's preictal or interictal state. This is done using a support vector machine (SVM), whose outputs are averaged using a running 15-minute window to obtain a final prediction score. The algorithm was tested on 19 of 21 patients in the Freiburg EEG data set who had three or more seizures, predicting 71 of 83 seizures, with 15 false predictions and 13.8h in seizure warning during 448.3h of interictal data. The proposed algorithm scales with the number of available EEG signals by discovering the variations in correlation structure among any given set of signals that correlate with seizure risk. Highlights \u25ba A novel multivariate EEG feature extraction technique is introduced. \u25ba Features are components of spatiotemporal correlation structure with the most variation. \u25ba Features are combined with patient-specific machine learning for seizure prediction. \u25ba Superior seizure prediction results are obtained on the Freiburg EEG database. Keywords Epilepsy Seizure prediction Multivariate features Electroencephalogram Correlation structure Machine learning Eigenvalues Principal components Support vector machines 1 Introduction Epilepsy affects approximately 1% of the general population [1]. Epilepsy puts patients at higher risk for injuries. Seizures can cause many injuries including falls, submersion injuries, burns, and many others. These happen because seizures can be sudden and occur without warning, leaving the patient unable to protect him- or herself. A review of epilepsy-related injuries found that patients with epilepsy, especially children, are at higher risk for submersion injuries [2]. Epilepsy also results in a higher risk for fractures, burns and motor vehicle accidents. If seizures can be reliably predicted and a preictal state can be identified with high sensitivity and specificity, it could help significantly in reducing these injuries. Research into seizure prediction has focused on several types of features that discriminate between interictal (period of time between seizures) and preictal (period of time immediately before a seizure) states. These include univariate features, such as the power spectral density or autoregressive modeling coefficients of single electroencephalogram (EEG) channels, as well as bivariate features that measure pairwise correlations between EEG channels, such as maximum cross correlation or phase synchrony [3,4]. Comparisons of feature extraction techniques have indicated greater discriminability for bivariate compared to univariate features, with similar discriminability for both linear and nonlinear bivariate features [3]. In addition to the question of feature discriminability is the question of how best to combine features to generate accurate and reliable seizure predictions. Recent machine learning approaches using high\u2010dimensional feature vectors have demonstrated significant improvements over approaches of retrospectively selecting univariate or bivariate features [5\u20138]. As technology improves and the number and quality of available EEG channels increase, it will become increasingly important to develop a scalable approach for signal analysis that extracts all the available useful information. The high levels of phenomenological variation of brain dynamics, both within a single patient over time and between different patients, imply the need to discover patterns that potentially involve all the available EEG channels across a range of temporal scales. These considerations motivate our algorithm, which generalizes and extends approaches for feature selection among multiple bivariate signal coherence features into an approach for feature extraction from a multivariate representation of correlations across channels and time. Feature extraction is based on the eigenspectra of space\u2013delay correlation and covariance matrices, which are computed from multichannel EEG signals at multiple relative time delays. These eigenspectra comprise the spatiotemporal correlation structure of the EEG signals. We hypothesize that preictal periods of increased seizure risk are reflected in changed brain dynamics that can be detected by changes in the spatiotemporal correlation structure. We describe in detail the feature extraction, machine learning, and seizure prediction components of our algorithm and demonstrate its performance on the Freiburg EEG database, with comparisons to previously published results. 2 Methods 2.1 EEG database and patient characteristics Our seizure prediction algorithm was evaluated on the Freiburg EEG database, which contains the intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from 21 patients suffering from medically intractable focal epilepsy. The data were recorded while the patients were undergoing invasive pre-surgical epilepsy monitoring at the Epilepsy Center of the University Hospital of Freiburg, Germany [9]. The data consist of six channels (i.e., recordings from six different electrodes) sampled at 256Hz. Three of these are focal channels (located near the epileptic focus), and three are extrafocal. The electrodes were referenced to a contact located in a brain structure with lowest epileptic activity. The data records for each patient are divided into ictal and interictal records. The ictal records contain epileptic seizures notated by experienced epileptologists, with at least 50min of preictal data preceding each seizure. The interictal records contain approximately 24h of recordings without seizure activity, at least 1h removed from the nearest seizure. The median time period between the last seizure and the interictal data set was 5h and 18min, and the median time period between the interictal data set and the first following seizure was 9h and 36min. The seizures occurred spontaneously and at different times of the day. Antiepileptic medication was reduced from usual levels in a majority of the patients; however, the types and levels of medications were not identical across patients as these treatments had to be adapted to their individual clinical needs. Three or more seizures were recorded for 19 of the 21 patients. Our algorithm was evaluated only on these 19 patients to ensure that at least two other preictal periods from the same patient could be used by the algorithm's machine learning (i.e., model estimation) step for each preictal period that it was evaluated on. The epileptic focus was located in neocortical brain structures in 10 of these 19 patients, in the hippocampus in seven, and in both brain areas in two. Table 1 lists many of the patient and database characteristics. For more extensive information about the data set, see [9]. The data records were preprocessed via bandpass filtering between .5 and 120Hz and a notch filter to remove line noise at 50Hz. Finally, each channel was normalized over a patient's entire data set into standard units of zero mean and unit variance to control for different power levels between the channels. 2.2 Feature extraction The feature extraction approach finds correlation patterns, both within and across EEG channels that exhibit the most significant changes over time. The correlation patterns are derived from the eigenspectra of the space\u2013delay correlation and covariance matrices, which are obtained from multichannel EEG signals at multiple relative time delays, using several delay scales. These spatiotemporal correlation structure features are well suited to a problem in which it is unknown a priori which sets of correlations across space and time are predictive of seizures. The components of spatiotemporal correlation structure that explain most of the data variance provide the basis set from which a mapping to seizure predictions is obtained using machine learning. This feature extraction approach was initially described in an earlier version of the current work [10] and has since been applied to the analysis of cardiopulmonary correlation structure for apnea prediction in preterm infants [11]. Table 2 summarizes the parameters and variables used in the feature extraction process. High-dimensional feature vectors are extracted from space\u2013delay covariance and correlation matrices, computed from 15\u2010s blocks of data at multiple delay scales. The term space refers to the spatial array of EEG sensor channels, and the term delay refers to the set of time delays applied to each channel. At each delay scale, these matrices contain covariance and correlation coefficients computed from the product set of EEG channels and time delays defined for that scale. Let Z t(j) be a set of signals for the jth block of data, where t(j) is the time stamp for the jth block in units of seconds. The start of each successive 15\u2010s block is contiguous with the end of the preceding block. Z t(j) has dimensionality (n s \u00d7 n c ) where n s is the number of samples per 15\u2010s block (n s =3840) and n c is the number of channels (n c =6). X jk is a set of time-delayed multichannel signals, (1) X jk = Z t j \u2212 \u03c4 1 k , \u2026 , Z t j \u2212 \u03c4 n d k , where \u03c4 ik is the ith time delay at the kth delay scale. X jk has dimensionality (n s \u00d7 n c n d ). The spacing of time delays depends on the delay scale: \u03c4 ik =(i \u22121)\u03b4 k s, with \u03b4 1 = 1 64 , \u03b4 2 = 1 16 , \u03b4 3 = 1 4 , and \u03b4 4 =1. Multiple delay scales are used so that the spatiotemporal correlation structure can be efficiently characterized over a long span of relative time delays. The time delays are densely sampled over short delay spans to capture high-frequency changes in correlation and sparsely sampled over long delay spans to capture low-frequency changes in correlation. The number of time delays, n d , is 32 for the smallest scale and 16 for the other three scales. The space\u2013delay matrices C jk \u2208 R n c n d \u00d7 n c n d and R jk \u2208 R n c n d \u00d7 n c n d are computed as follows. (2) C jk = 1 n s f X jk T f X jk , (3) R jk = 1 n s g X jk T g X jk , where f(\u22c5) shifts each column of X jk to zero mean, and g(\u22c5) shifts and normalizes each column to zero mean, unit variance. Fig. 1 provides two feature extraction examples. Fig. 1 (top panels) plots the EEG signals in two consecutive 15\u2010s blocks of preictal data, which occur about 23min prior to the first seizure for patient 17. The EEG signals are plotted after normalization by g(\u22c5) into standard units (with offsets from each other for visualization) because it is these normalized signals that are used to produce the space\u2013delay correlation matrices in Eq. (3). The top three signals are the focal channels, and the bottom three signals are the extrafocal channels. Fig. 1 (middle panels) shows the magnitude of space\u2013delay correlation matrices at the smallest delay scale, R j1, extracted from these blocks of data. Each 32\u00d732 block matrix along the main diagonal contains the within-channel correlations for the 32 time delays, whereas the off-diagonal blocks matrix contain the cross-channel correlations. The set of eigenvalues of R jk , rank-ordered from largest to smallest, is referred to as its eigenspectrum, (4) \u03bb jk = eig R jk . The eigenspectrum encodes the shape of the covariance distribution; that is, the magnitude of covariance in each dimension under the change of basis that decorrelates the dimensions. The eigenspectrum is invariant to the ordering of the columns of R jk , and thus to relationships among particular time-delayed channels (this information being encoded by the corresponding eigenvectors). Fig. 1 (bottom panel) plots the eigenspectrum from the first and second blocks of data in blue and red, respectively. The differences in the two space\u2013delay matrices are reflected in differently shaped eigenspectra. These differences are consequential: based on the outcome of machine learning (described below), the first block provides evidence against a preictal state, and the second block provides evidence in favor of a preictal state. Fig. 2 provides further insight by showing how the eigenspectra evolve over time. The eigenspectra are plotted after conversion into standard units for each eigenvalue rank. This way, changes can be seen in units of standard deviation relative to baseline variation. The eigenspectra are plotted during two \u223c3\u2010hour time intervals (A and B) that contain the first two seizures for patient 17. The time axes (in minutes) are shifted so that both seizures occur at time zero. As Fig. 2 shows, the eigenspectra form a unique pattern about 25min before the first seizure and about 30min before the second seizure. This pattern lasts until the onset of each seizure. In this pattern, the eigenvalues of both moderate energy modes (rank: 5\u201325) and low energy modes (rank: 145\u2013192) attain higher amplitudes than usual. Seizure onset then unleashes a dramatic change in the eigenspectra pattern, with a brief period during the seizures of very high amplitudes for eigenvalues of moderate energy modes (rank: 5\u201340) followed by a longer period spanning several minutes in which the energy is concentrated in the highest energy modes. Complementary features are also extracted, based on covariance properties of the EEG signals, which are sensitive to the signal amplitudes. These features are computed using the sum and the product of C jk 's eigenvalues at each delay scale: (5) \u03c1 jk = log tr C jk , (6) h jk = log det C jk . \u03c1 jk is the log of the total power, and h jk is an approximation of the entropy. Across the four delay scales, a total of 488 features are extracted from the jth block of data: {\u03bb j , \u03c1 j , h j } k =1,2,3,4. These features are highly correlated. The final stage of feature extraction is dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis (PCA) into a smaller set of decorrelated features containing the greatest amount of variance [12]. A critical step is to first convert each of the features into standard units (zero mean, unit variance), allowing the variation of each feature to be considered relative to its baseline variation. The conversion into standard units is done based on the training set features, with the conversion parameters used to obtain normalized test set features. Following this, the top n p principal components, x j , are computed from the training set, with the PCA conversion parameters used to obtain principal components from the normalized test set features. The number of principal components, n p =20, was empirically determined. 2.3 Machine learning The goal of patient-specific machine learning is to find, for each patient, a reliable mapping from the feature set described in Section 2.2 into the patient states, preictal (Class 1) or interictal (Class 2). The challenge is to find a mapping that generalizes well from a training set into an unseen test set. Due to the limited amount of data available for each patient in the Freiburg data set, machine learning is evaluated using cross-validation. In each fold of cross-validation, the data for each patient are partitioned into a test set and a training set. Feature normalization, dimensionality reduction, and classifier training on the training set data produce a set of parameters used to obtain classifier outputs on the test set data. The classifier is a support vector machine (SVM), which learns nonlinear mappings from the training set features, {x} j =1,\u2026,n T , where n T is the number of training samples, into the patient's state, preictal (+1) or interictal (\u22121) [13]. In each fold of cross-validation, either the preictal data segment preceding a single seizure or a single (usually 60min) record of interictal data was used for testing. When a preictal data segment was tested, the SVM was trained on 30-minute preictal data segments preceding the other seizures of the same patient, as well as the entire interictal data set of the same patient. When an interictal data record was tested, the SVM was trained on all the 30-minute preictal data segments, as well as all interictal data that are separated in time by at least 30min from the tested data. This 30-minute buffer avoids training on interictal data that are highly correlated due to temporal proximity. The SVM classifier was implemented using the SVM-Light software package [14]. The radial basis kernel was used with regularization parameter \u03b3=.1; otherwise, the default parameters were used. Prior to training and testing, the training set features, {x} j =1,\u2026,n T , were normalized to standard units, with the resulting parameters used to normalize the held-out test data. Each SVM output, y j , indicates the likelihood of the patient being in a preictal state (Class 1: j \u2208 C 1) versus an interictal state (Class 2: j \u2208 C 2). Small relative biases in the y j values were found among different cross-validation folds and different patients. In order to obtain a consistent performance evaluation using a common seizure prediction threshold, these biases were estimated and removed. This was done, within each fold of cross-validation, using a training set validation procedure for bias estimation. This consisted of five validation runs on the training set. In each validation run, 80% of the training examples were randomly assigned to the validation training set, and the remainder to the validation testing set. Let y \u02dc j j \u2208 C i designate the SVM validation test outputs mapping to class C i , where i =1 or 2. The bias was estimated as the cross-over point for Gaussian models of the Class 1 and Class 2 SVM outputs, N \u03bc \u02dc i , \u03c3 \u02dc i , where \u03bc \u02dc i = mean y \u02dc j j \u2208 C i and \u03c3 \u02dc i = std y \u02dc j j \u2208 C i . The overall bias estimate, \u03b2, was obtained by averaging the bias estimates from the five independent validation runs. The bias estimate was then subtracted from the SVM outputs: y ^ j = y j \u2212 \u03b2 . Fig. 3 plots (in red) these bias-corrected SVM outputs before and after the first two seizures for patient 17. These correspond to the same time intervals as those shown in Fig. 2. The change in correlation structure, which is visibly evident in Fig. 2, is reflected in stronger SVM detections of a preictal state in the 25 to 30min prior to each seizure. 2.4 Temporal integration and prediction evaluation The corrected SVM outputs, y ^ j , are noisy and need to be integrated over time to produce a reliable prediction score. The y ^ j values are analogous to independent log-likelihood ratios, and so a temporal average is an appropriate form of integration, which keeps the integrated scores on the same scale as the original scores: (7) z j = 1 n a \u2211 j \u2212 n a + 1 j y ^ j , where n a =60 provides a time window average of 15min. Fig. 3 plots (in blue) the z j values. Note that integration is not done across session boundaries, and that the scores are valid only after 15min have elapsed since the beginning of each session. In our study, sensitivity is determined from the preictal data segments and specificity from the interictal data. This methodology is consistent with previously published reports [3,5\u20139]. Sensitivity and specificity are computed based on a seizure prediction threshold, T z , and a seizure prediction window of duration \u03c4 w . Whenever z j > T z , the seizure prediction is triggered (i.e., the seizure warning is on for the subsequent time interval \u03c4 w ). If a seizure takes place during this interval, then the seizure is correctly predicted. Unlike many previously published reports, we allow retriggering of the prediction window while the seizure warning is on [11,15]. This provides a more practical seizure prediction policy that tends to reduce the frequency of warnings while extending their durations. Retriggering is also easier to evaluate since the sensitivity, s n = TP TP + FN , can be computed exactly using only the data interval \u03c4 w preceding each seizure. Without retriggering, reasonable estimates of s n require much longer preictal data intervals, since successful triggers could easily be preempted by earlier unsuccessful triggers, which could in turn be preempted by even earlier triggers, and so on. With retriggering, specificity needs to be judged using two measures: the warning rate, r w , and the proportion of time spent in warning, \u03c1 w [15]. For our purposes, r w is the rate (per hour) at which continuous warnings are initially triggered in the interictal set, and \u03c1 w is the proportion of interictal time (which does not include the 15\u2010minute integration buffer at the start of each session) spent in warning. 3 Results 3.1 Default parameters The seizure prediction algorithm was tested on a data set of 19 patients, containing a total of 83 preictal periods and 448.3h of interictal data. Table 3 summarizes the seizure prediction results using the algorithm's default parameter set. The number of SVM support vectors (averaged across the folds of cross-validation) is shown, as are the prediction results for three prediction threshold values: T z =\u2212.1,0,1. Table 3 shows the s n , r w , and \u03c1 w values calculated on a patient by patient basis, as well as on the total population. As T z is varied, the total number of seizures that are predicted changes from 79 (s n =.95) to 73 (s n =.88) to 71 (s n =.86). These changes in s n are driven by only five patients, with 50% of the changes due to patient 20 alone. Meanwhile, the total number of false alarms varies from 33 (r w =.07/h) to 22 (r w =.05/h) to 15 (r w =.03/h). These changes are also driven by a small number of patients, with 56% of the changes due to patients 11, 19 and 20, and 33% of the changes due to patient 20 alone. The total number of interictal hours spent in warning varies from 38.3 (\u03c1 w =.09) to 20.8 (\u03c1 w =.05) to 13.8 (\u03c1 w =.03). With current parameter settings, the r w and \u03c1 w values are similar. Shortening the seizure prediction window, \u03c4 w , below its current value of 30min tends to increase the triggering rate, r w , relative to the time in warning, \u03c1 w . Increasing \u03c4 w tends to have the opposite effect. We have also found that adding a short prediction horizon buffer prior to each seizure, during which warnings are considered to be too late, has a negligible effect on sensitivity. For example, a prediction buffer of 2min results in the loss of only one correctly predicted seizure compared to the results shown in Table 3. 3.2 Parameter variations The sensitivity of seizure prediction performance to changes in the system parameters (listed in Table 2) was also explored. This was done by varying: the duration of each data block (and hence s n , the number of samples per block, and n a , the number of SVM outputs that are averaged to obtain a 15\u2010minute integration time); the number of delay scales, n d ; the number of principal components, n p ; and, finally, the marginal contribution of the covariance features, \u03c1 j,k and h j,k . For each parameter variation experiment, the remaining parameters were kept fixed. The sensitivity analysis was done using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, obtained from the summary results on all 19 patients. These curves are produced by sweeping through all possible values of T z , and then plotting prediction sensitivity, s n , as a function of proportion of time spent in warning, \u03c1 w . For example, Fig. 4 shows the ROC curve obtained using the default parameters (solid curve), with the three\u2010point cases from Table 3 (T z ={\u2212.1,0,1}) plotted with open circles. Fig. 4 also shows the ROC curve obtained in our first parameter variation by switching from 15\u2010s data blocks to 7.5\u2010s data blocks (dashed line). This change entails setting n s =1920 and n a =120. The 7.5\u2010s block size clearly results in degraded performance, as s n values are consistently lower for any given value of \u03c1 w . We use a summary ROC performance metric, the area under the ROC curve (AUC). At one extreme, AUC=1 indicates perfect prediction performance. At the other extreme, AUC=.5 indicates chance performance. The ROC curve obtained by using the default parameters (Fig. 4, bold line) results in AUC=.973. The ROC curve from the 7.5\u2010s data block condition (Fig. 4, dashed line) results in AUC=.936. A third condition of using a 30\u2010s data block (s n =7,680, n a =30) produces a result very similar to the default, with AUC=.972. Fig. 5A plots the AUC results, with conditions 1\u20133 corresponding to block durations of 7.5s, 15s, and 30s, respectively. These results indicate that performance is stable over a large range of data block durations, but it degrades if the duration is much shorter than the default 15\u2010s duration. The four delay scales span a wide range of relative delays over which EEG correlations are computed. The smallest scale covers delays of up to .5s, thereby spanning the range of typical cortical propagation times. The larger delay scales, covering ranges of 1s, 4s, and 16s respectively, are more speculative because they register correlations in EEG patterns that occur over longer time scales. The marginal utility of these scales is investigated by starting with the smallest scale, and then successively adding the next larger scale to ascertain its effect on prediction performance. These results are plotted in Fig. 5B, with conditions 1\u20134 corresponding to delay scales {1}, {1,2}, {1,2,3}, and {1,2,3,4}, respectively. Fig. 5B shows that the second scale, which only moderately increases the range of delays (from .5s to 1s), produces a negligible improvement in performance. The third scale, which spans delays up to 4s, produces a larger, yet still moderate, performance improvement. Finally, the largest scale, spanning delays up to 16s, produces a negligible additional improvement. Therefore, it appears that using two widely separated delay scales would probably suffice in producing similar performance as is achieved by using all four scales. Also, using only the smallest delay scale results in good performance, with only a moderate performance increment from using the larger delay scales. Using the default set of four delay scales results in a 488\u2010dimensional feature for each data block. One of the key steps for the seizure prediction algorithm is to project this vector, using PCA, into a lower dimensional feature vector that provides an effective basis for SVM machine learning. Too few principal components would provide insufficient discriminative information, whereas too many principal components would degrade the ability of the SVM to generalize novel test data, due to the inclusion of noisy features that have little discriminative value. Fig. 5C explores this trade-off by plotting the AUC values obtained with n p =10,15,20,30,40 in conditions 1\u20135 respectively. Fig. 5C shows that performance is sensitive to n p , with the default value of n p =20 appearing to be close to an optimal value. The final parameter variation experiment explores the marginal utility of the covariance-based features in Eqs. (5) and (6). Unlike the correlation-based features in Eq. (4), the covariance features are affected by the relative power levels in the EEG channels. As a preprocessing step, these power levels were equalized based on global statistics. In prospective operation, however, the seizure prediction algorithm would require that this normalization step be done based on retrospective data only. In addition, using fixed normalization coefficients could be inappropriate if the channel power levels are nonstationary. Therefore, it is of interest to discover how sensitive the seizure prediction performance is both to the availability of the covariance-based features and to the availability of the channel power normalization. Therefore, in the first condition, system performance was evaluated with the covariance features completely removed. In the second condition, the covariance features were used without the EEG normalization preprocessing step, resulting in power levels with considerable variation among the different channels. The third condition shows, for comparison, the results using the default setting of global channel normalization. As Fig. 5D shows, removing the covariance features entirely (condition 1) produces a relatively small decrement in prediction performance, and removing the channel normalization step (condition 2) produces an even smaller decrement. Based on the parameter variation experiments, we have isolated three important ingredients for the seizure prediction algorithm. These are: (1) using the space\u2013delay correlation features computed at the smallest delay scale, as well as preferably another much larger delay scale; (2) computing these features from data blocks of sufficiently long duration; and (3) extracting the appropriate number of principal components from these features to feed into the SVM. Finally, the relatively large sensitivity of prediction performance to the number of PCA components leads us to speculate that improvements in this dimensionality\u2010reduction step could lead to significant performance gains. 4 Discussion The primary purpose of our work is to develop a scalable multivariate feature extraction algorithm that captures sufficient information about changes in EEG spatiotemporal correlation structure to provide a useful basis for seizure prediction. The utility of the extracted features is demonstrated, in combination with a patient-specific SVM classifier, by the ability to predict seizures in the Freiburg data set with both high sensitivity and high specificity. 4.1 Feature extraction The proposed feature extraction algorithm is an extension and generalization of previous approaches, in which the eigenspectra of EEG spatial correlation matrices were used to analyze seizure dynamics [16\u201320]. We have replaced the spatial correlation matrices used in these studies with space\u2013delay matrices that contain correlation coefficients from the product set of multiple EEG channels and multiple time delays. This results in eigenspectra with richer information content and greater discriminatory power due to the presence of varying correlation patterns among the EEG channels at multiple time delays. We have also found additional discriminatory power by employing sets of time delays at four different delay scales, with the greatest contribution coming from the smallest scale (which is highlighted in Figs. 1 and 2). The neurophysiological meaning of the eigenvalue distributions found in our study is not entirely clear. The correlation patterns between the different areas of the brain represented by different iEEG channels are probably continually changing, depending on the different activities being performed and the state of consciousness. As per our study and previous studies [18,19], the eigenvalues of the highest energy modes become dominant during seizures, indicating greater synchrony. In the minutes preceding a seizure, on the other hand, the eigenvalues of moderate or low energy modes may dominate relatively speaking (see Fig. 2), indicating a less synchronized state. Synchrony is also a function of the state of consciousness, as EEG activity is more synchronized during sleep compared to the more alert states. Given this, we wonder if an amplification of the eigenvalue distributions in the low and moderate energy states during preictal phases indicates a general state of increased alertness. This would be in agreement with an analysis of frequency flow dynamics in temporal lobe and extra-temporal epilepsy in which it was found that frequencies build up in the 5\u201312\u2010Hz range just prior to a seizure [21\u201323]. Also, intracranial EEG gives only a focal rather than a global picture, and it is difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding the state of consciousness from this data. In the future, we plan to apply the algorithm to prolonged scalp EEG data of patients with epilepsy and normal volunteers to gain more insight into the neurophysiological meaning of the eigenvalue distributions. The relationship of the eigenvalue distributions to synchronization is also complicated by the effects of varying EEG signal bandwidths. There has been recent work aimed at disentangling the contributions of genuine versus random correlations in sample correlation coefficients by taking into account the fact that the relative contribution of random correlations increases as the effective signal bandwidth decreases [17,20]. In our work, these two contributions remain mixed, and so changes in the eigenspectra over time reflect not only changes in the phase relationships between the signal frequency components but also changes in the effective signal bandwidths. Separating out these contributions, either by using the approach proposed in [20] or by separating each EEG channel into multiple bandpass components, would add greatly to the computational complexity of our algorithm. An alternative multivariate analysis approach is to derive network topologies from sets of EEG correlation coefficients (or other measures of synchrony) and then to characterize network dynamics using summary statistics derived from the networks, such as average path length and clustering coefficient [24,25]. In contrast to our algorithm, which extracts eigenspectra directly from the entire set of correlation coefficients, these more elaborate network analysis approaches involve two stages of strong nonlinearities, during which valuable discriminative information may be lost. The first nonlinearity is computing a set of network edges from the correlation coefficients, and the second nonlinearity is computing various statistical measures from the resulting network, which characterize aspects of the network topology. 4.2 Seizure prediction A number of recent studies have reported good seizure prediction results on the Freiburg data set using patient-specific machine learning [5\u20138]. The features used in these studies include bivariate measures of EEG synchrony [5], univariate autoregressive model coefficients [6], and spectral power features following either time- or space-differential preprocessing [7,8]. Different groups have used different training/testing methodologies, and so comparative evaluations must remain tentative. Our methodology is most similar to the ones used in studies on seizure detection [26\u201328] in terms of how cross-validation is structured and how SVM classifiers are trained using the same parameters for all patients. Among the seizure prediction studies, the most notable methodological difference from our approach is the lack of temporal separation imposed between interictal training and testing data in [5,6]. The classifiers in these studies were trained and tested on short interictal segments that were randomly interleaved with each other. This methodology, especially when used in conjunction with powerful classifiers (convolution neural networks and SVMs), can produce significantly overoptimistic estimates of specificity. This is due to the fact that temporally proximate data tend to be highly correlated. In [7,8], on the other hand, a more valid cross-validation methodology was used in which the interictal data sets were partitioned into separate contiguous training and testing data sets in each fold of cross-validation. Thus, close temporal proximity between interictal training and testing data occurred only at the partition boundaries. In terms of seizure prediction results, these studies produced similar sensitivity (s n ) scores to ours, but with much lower specificity (higher r w and \u03c1 w scores). It is unclear to what extent these differences are due to differences in the extracted features or differences in the training/testing methodology. On one hand, the methodology in [7,8] could produce overoptimistic values for \u03c1 w due to the lack of seizure prediction retriggering and overoptimistic values for both r w and \u03c1 w due to the temporal proximities at the boundaries between training and testing interictal sets. On the other hand, [7,8] used fewer folds of cross-validation than we did, resulting in the inclusion of less interictal data in each training set partition. This could cause their specificity estimates to be more pessimistic than ours. A final notable difference is the use in [7,8] of different SVM training parameters for each patient, based on a double cross-validation parameter search. While this procedure is methodologically sound, the fact that tailoring of SVM parameters was needed suggests that the features used in these studies may not be as easily discriminable as ours. Further research is needed to resolve what the relative merits are of the spectral features used in these studies compared to the correlation structure features used in our study. 4.3 Way forward Moving forward, the best approach for comparative evaluations of feature extraction and machine learning algorithms will be to use the larger EEG data sets that are now becoming available, such as the European epilepsy database [29,30]. The availability of long-term continuous recordings for each patient will allow reliable prospective evaluations of seizure prediction performance, avoiding the difficulties and concerns associated with patient-specific cross-validation training on limited data sets. The capabilities (and limitations) of machine learning will then become more apparent, as prediction algorithms become exposed to broader ranges of patients' dynamical states. Continuous long-term recordings will also allow better assessments of the time-specificity of seizure predictions, which are difficult to do on the Freiburg data set due to the relatively limited durations of its preictal data. Finally, the Freiburg data set is limited not only temporally but also spatially due to its inclusion of only six iEEG channels. With the coming availability of large spatial arrays of up to 125 iEEG channels [32], it will be increasingly important to consider scalable multivariate approaches to feature extraction that are sensitive to changing correlation patterns among the channel arrays.
