Several additional descriptors determined by SVM method, such as highest occupied molecular orbit (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbit (LUMO), combined with conventional fields of CoMFA and CoMSIA were employed to construct 3D-QSAR model. The results show that inclusion of HOMO and LUMO is meaningful for 3D-QSAR model. The validation of this model was testified by some structural diverse compounds, which were not included in the CoMFA and CoMSIA models. Therefore, the non-linear SVM method can be applied to the selection of reasonable additional descriptors for 3D-QSAR investigations. The combination of these techniques could dramatically improve the statistical properties of model.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Support vector machine"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Additional descriptors"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Highest occupied molecular orbit"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Lowest unoccupied molecular orbit"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003267008012750", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003267008012750", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "48949085471", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-48949085471", "pubmed-id": "18706326", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/48949085471", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20080705", "$": "2008-07-05"}}}}}
