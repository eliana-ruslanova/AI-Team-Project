Fig. 1 Basic sub-processes involved in the healthcare provisioning for elective ambulatory chronic patients. Three main sub-processes are identified: (1) Medical evaluation to assess the overall health condition of the patient; (2) treatment planning to decide the strategy to tackle the patients follow up and (3) specialist control consultation to monitor and assess the evolution of the patient. Fig. 2 Redesigned processes to include stakeholders\u2019 coordination and data, knowledge and process management capabilities. Four main sub-processes are identified: (a) Assisted medical evaluation, which supports the diagnosis task with automated search of information; (b) assisted treatment planning to support the medical staff with automated treatments search and the patient monitoring setting; (c) signal control and alarm generation to provide input to the consultation and keep track of the patient\u2019s vitals and (d) assisted specialist control consultation to provide better information of the health index, medical alarms and history checkup, treatment evaluation and search for treatment activities.

Abstract New advances in telemedicine, ubiquitous computing, and artificial intelligence have supported the emergence of more advanced applications and support systems for chronic patients. This trend addresses the important problem of chronic illnesses, highlighted by multiple international organizations as a core issue in future healthcare. Despite the myriad of exciting new developments, each application and system is designed and implemented for specific purposes and lacks the flexibility to support different healthcare concerns. Some of the known problems of such developments are the integration issues between applications and existing healthcare systems, the reusability of technical knowledge in the creation of new and more sophisticated systems and the usage of data gathered from multiple sources in the generation of new knowledge. This paper proposes a framework for the development of chronic disease support systems and applications as an answer to these shortcomings. Through this framework our pursuit is to create a common ground methodology upon which new developments can be created and easily integrated to provide better support to chronic patients, medical staff and other relevant participants. General requirements are inferred for any support system from the primary attention process of chronic patients by the Business Process Management Notation. Numerous technical approaches are proposed to design a general architecture that considers the medical organizational requirements in the treatment of a patient. A framework is presented for any application in support of chronic patients and evaluated by a case study to test the applicability and pertinence of the solution. Keywords Data architecture Chronic disease management Ubiquitous health (u-health) services Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) Ubiquitous computing Interoperability 1 Introduction The World Health Organization (WHO) defines chronic disease as \u201ca disease that persists for a long time and of slow evolution\u201d [1]. Chronic diseases or non-communicative diseases (NCD) are one of the leading causes of death in the world; they account for 70% of the total diseases in 2016. More than 35 million people died from chronic conditions in 2016 [1]. The current growth of chronic diseases in the population is concerning. In the US alone, the number of chronic patients is estimated to increase by 15 million in 2025 [2,3]. The worldwide increase in the occurrence of chronic diseases, along with the impact of these diseases on total health expenditure, is driving the search for new alternatives to better adapt and improve current healthcare models and patient care provisioning systems [2,4\u20136]. Current healthcare technologies and practices are not specifically prepared to handle chronic patients and their special needs [1]. Their focus on quick diagnoses and the treatment of patients is not suitable for the need of chronic patients. Specific requirements arise for chronic patients, such as long-term treatment, in and out of the hospital monitoring, and the cooperation of a patient\u2019s family and friends and medical staff [7\u20139]. An active approach in treatment has been proposed to address the specific needs of chronic patients [4,10]. This approach aims to detect early symptoms and treat them before they evolve into a more complex condition. Also, this approach attempts to make patients stewards of their own care [11]. In this context, the role of computational systems in the support of the various processes related to a chronic patient\u2019s treatment has significant potential. Extensive work has proven the effectiveness of artificial intelligence in the support of medical staff [12\u201314], information management systems to assist in the treatment of patients [15], the coordination of people around patients [7], and signal processing to monitor \u2013 even remotely \u2013 patient vitals and provide early detection of symptoms [16]. There exist different solutions for different tasks of the diagnosis and treatment process of chronic patients. These systems do not address the entire healthcare provisioning process; instead, they focus on parts of it. Some of the limitations are the inflexibility of the developments that are only designed for specific chronic conditions and the difficulty of expanding or reutilizing the existing knowledge [6,17\u201319]. In addition, existing solutions are not embedded into the organizational context of healthcare processes, which hinder their implementation given the differences in each healthcare center [20\u201322]. This paper leverages the Business Process Management approach to comprehensively analyze the clinical pathways of the chronic patient care process [23,24]. This analysis highlights the basic clinical pathways that are involved in the care provisioning of these patients and is sufficiently general to be used in the diagnosis and improvement of existing processes. From this analysis, general requirements are elicited to support any chronic patient: (1) support and coordination of all participants in the treatment process, (2) data management, (3) knowledge management and (4) process orchestration. From these general requirements, the following technical approaches are developed to support chronic patients: distributed computing, ontology support, process composition, and context awareness. To address the previously mentioned requirements and approaches, the clinical pathways that comprise treatment of a chronic patient are redesigned using the Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN). This redesign involves the technological support in the context of healthcare organizational processes. To support these processes, this paper proposes ProFUSO (Process-oriented Framework for Ubiquitous Systems based on Ontologies), a framework that consists of four layers to gather, store, process and deliver information to interested stakeholders. This framework is a comprehensive architecture for a holistic approach to manage all stages of the chronic patient diagnosis and treatment. This general software architecture attempts to guide the development of healthcare provisioning support applications for chronic patients. The different functionalities are separated into services that can be selected and composed, which provides flexibility. They are termed ubiquitous health (u-health) services. In addition, two general solutions to solve the relevant issues of semantic matching and remote data gathering are proposed. The former enables applications derived from the framework to semantically match patients\u2019 context with possible diagnosis and treatments \u2013 in the form of u-health services \u2013, and the latter enables remote patient monitoring. From the chronic patient attention process analysis and redesign, this paper establishes a set of basic, invariant u-health services that are needed to implement any healthcare provisioning support application for chronic patients. These services are evaluated in a use case to test the framework\u2019s suitability and usability. The implementation involved 16 healthcare professionals from the largest pediatric hospital in Santiago, Chile, for the case of remote monitoring of respiratory-related chronic patients. The results indicated a high level of suitability and usability; 100% of healthcare professionals consider the implementation useful, 81% of healthcare professionals consider the implementation easy to use and 81% of healthcare professionals consider that the implementation contributes to triggering preventive actions. In terms of the technical evaluation of the architectonical solution for remote data gathering, the results are promising. A set of tests was conducted to measure the throughput of a remote system that implements the data-gathering layer. Different data sources of remote signals were considered to stress the system. In this manner, the throughput was measured to 92% in average considering data sources of high frequency, such as photoplethysmography (50\u202fHz), temperature (5\u202fHz), and accelerometer and gyroscope (50\u202fHz). Note that these sampling frequencies exceed the requirements of other medical devices that are used for gathering mobile vitals. In terms of the semantic approach, our tests indicate that the matching algorithms for service selection and composition according to the patients\u2019 context is kept under two minutes for an ontology that holds 100,000 healthcare-related processes. The roadmap of this paper is described as follows: Section 2 describes important concepts and literature review to follow this paper. This section addresses the existing approaches to the healthcare support for chronic patients and highlights the current accomplishments and areas of improvement. In Section 3, the requirements to address the chronic patient support problem are inferred. Section 4 presents a redesign of clinical pathways for chronic patients and a corresponding software architecture of the proposed framework to guide the development of healthcare provisioning support applications for chronic patients. The solution evaluation in terms of usability and pertinence to the medical reality, the technical evaluation of the framework and the sample u-health services implementation and deployment to support the real case scenarios are detailed in Section 5. Section 6 discusses the results and their validity, and Section 7 presents the paper\u2019s conclusions and outlines future work. 2 Background and literature review The healthcare condition of a chronic patient is determined by all medical, social, and environmental information that affects the medical decisions and the short- and long-term management of the patient. Lenz AND Reichert [25] states that all previously mentioned factors of a patient\u2019s condition can be summarized in a cycle of patient-related data gathering, decision-making and treatment application based on medical knowledge and patient information. Efforts in the areas of the formal representation of medical diagnostic and therapeutic business processes, electronic health (e-health), medical knowledge management and clinical decision support systems, which support the diagnosis-therapeutic cycle up, are relevant to this paper. Additionally, in the context of chronic patients, the concept of ubiquitous computing (Ubicomp) is particularly relevant given the requirement of continuous monitoring for these patients in their daily lives. 2.1 Computer-interpretable guidelines and business process modeling The diagnose-therapeutic cycle involves data gathering and interpretation, decision-making and the application of treatments. These aspects comprise medical procedures gathered in clinical practice guidelines that contain relevant information about specific diseases [26\u201337]. These guidelines contain clinical workflows \u2014formal structures to graphically represent procedures and decisions \u2014 as a means to provide a schematic representation of these procedures [38\u201345] in order to improve the quality of the care provisioning, standardize practices, and reducing healthcare cost [27]. It is paramount for these guidelines to be integrated into the care flow as to provide meaningful support in the context of the care provisioning process. The formalization of these guidelines into Computer-Interpretable Guidelines (CIG) fosters the integration of these guidelines into the healthcare operations. Based on CIG, computational systems can provide support to the decision making, giving birth to the CGI-based Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) \u2013 see Section 2.4 for more details in CDSS. This is how numerous computer-oriented languages, such as Asbru [46\u201348], PROforma [49], SAGE [33,50], BPeL [23,51], among others, are available to represent and execute medical procedures [26,50,52\u201358]. Instead of starting from the CIG to create a support system we propose to start from more general care provisioning process. To this end we use business process concepts to describe the healthcare processes, a tool extensively employed to describe organizational processes in different domains. A business process is a group of structured, coordinated and measurable activities that deliver a product or service [23]. The BPMN is a standard and a methodology to graphically model, understand and analyze these business processes [23,24,59]. BPMN is intended to design and optimize the resources that are employed in the provisioning of services, such as a patient treatment. Given the scope of the BPMN approach to represent both the organizational and the clinical view, we use BPMN to integrate the CIGs into the care flows. In this way it is possible to integrate multiple tasks in the health processes in charge of providing the patient with both treatment within the hospital and monitoring outside the hospital, avoiding the isolated implementation of CIGs. 2.2 E-health and ubiquitous computing E-health is an \u201cemerging field in the intersection of medical informatics, public health and business, referring to health services and information delivered or enhanced through the Internet and related technologies\u201d [60]. Based on this definition, the e-health concept is a broad idea that merges not only the medical field and the computer science field but also healthcare as a complex mix of processes, in which technology is used to derive information from multiple sources and include all stakeholders in the delivery of this relevant information. This field is composed of numerous other subfields, such as Telehealth, Telemedicine, Mobile-health, and Remote Patient Monitoring. These fields are part of the evolution of e-Health, which will foster a real ubiquitous and mobile treatment and support of patients [8,61,62]. The Ubicomp paradigm offers a formal approach from the computer science point of view to the realization of the idea of continuous and mobile support of the chronic patient. Derived in 1991 with the founding paper of Mark Weiser [63], Ubicomp proposes a set of characteristics for transparent, distributed, mobile and non-obtrusive systems [64]. These requirements include the autonomous working capability of computers in distributed networks, which interact with humans in their typical physical environment and provide meaningful information and support in their daily activities and awareness of a user\u2019s context information. Context is a relevant idea for the ubiquitous systems\u2019 transparent, implicit and autonomous interaction with humans. Context is \u201cany information that can be used to characterize the situation of entities (i.e., a person, a place, a topic, a system, and a network, among others) which are considered relevant for the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and the application themselves\u201d [65]. This general idea of context information can be divided into two types of context: a high-level context and a low-level context. A low-level context is the context that can be captured by sensors and is directly interpreted by computers, whereas a high-level context is the context that must be reasoned from the low-level context. For example, a patient\u2019s temperature is a low-level context associated with temperature, and \u201cfever\u201d is a high-level context associated with temperature. Any applications that continuously monitor patients and provide diagnosis and control support in a semi-automatic way anywhere and anytime based on context information are considered to be in the field of Ubicomp. Some examples of ubiquitous computing applications in the healthcare domain are WiBreath [66] and BilliCam [67]. The first one deriving the breath frequency out of wireless sensors and the second one detecting new born icterus using the smartphone\u2019s camera. These applications are available for specific purposes in the e-health field, which enables Ubicomp to evolve into more pervasive support systems for patients [8,61,62]. General and flexible Ubicomp platforms that support chronic patients in the full treatment process for any type of chronic disease remain lacking. 2.3 Knowledge management in healthcare One of the most relevant contributions of the Semantic Web to manage knowledge of any type is the construct of ontologies. Through them is possible to formalize precise definitions on concepts and their relationships. In particular the usage of ontologies in the medical domain allows the formalization of medical concepts and process to integrate unstructured data and identify new relationships among concepts via automated reasoning [68]. In the medical domain, ontologies enable the implementation of smart applications that utilize medical knowledge to provide services to patients and stakeholders in accordance with predefined treatments. Ontologies are typically written using markup languages (i.e. XML, RDFS, etc.) and accessed via semantic query languages (i.e. SPARQL), this semantic information is later used by inference engine to extract new knowledge. Every ontology includes the following main elements: \u2022 Classes: represent concepts in a specific domain. For instance, in the healthcare domain, \u201cPatient\u201d, \u201cPhysician\u201d and \u201cDisease\u201d are examples of classes. \u2022 Relationships: represent associations among classes. Since a \u201cPatient\u201d has a \u201cPhysician\u201d, a relationship \u201cisDoctorOf\u201d can be defined between a \u201cPhysician\u201d and one or more \u201cPatients\u201d. \u2022 Instances: are objects that pertain to a class. In the example, \u201cJohn Doe Md\u201d is an instance of the class \u201cPhysician\u201d. \u2022 Attributes: represent characteristics of the classes. For instance, a \u201cPatient\u201d may have an attribute \u201cAge\u201d, whereas an instance will take the value \u201c70\u201d. In the medical field, numerous initiatives aim to formalize medical knowledge into ontologies for later usage. These initiatives range from large ambitious projects, such as Opengalen [69], to domain-specific projects, such as the project in Prcela et al. [70]. The first type of initiative aims to formalize all existing medical knowledge \u2013 from the structural definitions of cells to different treatments for cardiopathic patients \u2013 whereas the second type of initiative is a specific ontology for knowledge related to cardiac insufficiency. 2.4 Clinical decision support systems Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) appeared in the 1970s. CDSS are software systems that are designed to assist health professionals in various stages of a patient\u2019s treatment, especially in decision-making tasks. The main goal of CDSS is to provide accurate information to the right person at the right time. CDSS have proven to be effective in supporting medical staff in the processes of diagnosis, treatment planning, alarms and reminders delivery, storage and retrieval of patient histories, and remote monitoring [71,72]. Recent studies of CDSS have focused on embedding support systems into Ubicomp environments. The aim of this approach is to enhance the data used to support a patient\u2019s treatment and to better communicate relevant information to all stakeholders involved in the patient\u2019s recovery process. In applications such as Smart CDSS for Smart Homes [73], the authors propose a framework to handle an alarm system for a patient enriched with clinical context from the patient\u2019s vitals. Similarly, [74,75] address a similar problem but focus on the specific domains of type 2 diabetes, predict the respiratory capacity of a patient, apnea, and papanicolaou test image classification. The idea of monitoring vitals has been extended to support medical procedures and clinical pathways, such as the case of CONFlexFlow [15], which generates recommendations to medical staff by considering the actual clinical pathways to create a more practical recommendation. Specifically, for chronic patients, the majority of existing studies focus on remote patient monitoring. By monitoring patients\u2019 vitals and extracting knowledge from this information, this approach has been successful in realizing the ideal of continuous healthcare provisioning. Although the majority of these systems are successful in the usage of some sort of context, they primarily focused on symptomatology as the context. The shortcoming of this approach is that symptoms represent a very specific low-level context and disregard the scope-relevant high-level context, such as the risk of a critical state, real-time patient evolution monitoring, and environmental context. In terms of the processes, existing studies consider only one or two of a chronic patient\u2019s process treatments; this support is provided by either specific software architectures that address particular situations related to a patient\u2019s illness and/or by specific ontologies that are tightly coupled with the system. Although these findings render these solutions a suitable approach to specific situations, they lack flexibility and do not provide holistic support of a patient or his/her medical staff and social circle. As the main focus of CDSS is to provide decision support they often do not act in other steps of the care provisioning \u2013 such as monitoring, sensing, or communication support \u2013 losing sight of the whole healthcare process. In this study we propose a framework that considers the whole patient\u2019s treatment cycle. 3 Requirements analysis The construction of a framework is an exercise of abstraction and modeling that is intended to create reusable structures to address similar problems in the future. Our method considers three main stages: \u2022 Business process model analysis: The goal is to understand, map, and generalize the clinical pathways involved in the attention of chronic patients. We present an overview of the patient-related processes that is extendable to the vast majority of scenarios. \u2022 High-level functional requirements inference: From the business process model analysis, we extract the general requirements for a support system for the specific case of chronic patients. \u2022 Technical approaches: High-level requirements are subsequently mapped to technical approaches to provide input to the framework and its concrete design. 3.1 Business process model analysis Medical organizations are complex institutions where medical staff collaborate. General medical guidelines are applied in coordinated interactions among medical staff, patients, and various stakeholders, such as patient\u2019s family, hospital administrative employees, and laboratory staff. In related studies, two main types of processes are identified in healthcare organizations: the organizational processes and the clinical processes \u2013 also known as clinical pathways [17]. The formers address the coordination of organizational units and healthcare professionals, whereas the latter are a road map linked to the patient management in his/her diagnosis and treatment cycle. In addition, organizational and clinical processes are dependent on the place of their occurrence [7]. Organizational processes will differ among centers according to the organization characteristics and physical environment (i.e., organizing medical staff that are physically located in a single location vs. multiple locations). The medical knowledge that is contained in the form of medical guidelines is managed and applied in healthcare centers by medical specialists who will apply these guidelines to actual patients in accordance with working conditions and available resources. This issue creates gaps between the general guidelines and the actual application of these guidelines to specific patients in each specific healthcare center. Medical aid is provided to patients based on medical guidelines but according to the organizational and physical constraints of healthcare centers. Therefore, it is necessary to perform a general analysis of the description of healthcare organizational processes to establish a common ground to describe chronic patient service provisioning. In fact, patients visit a healthcare center for multiple reasons, such as periodic checkups, medical complications, emergencies, and scheduled consultations. From a business process point of view, the service provisioning to patients can be categorized in three main groups in terms of the specific reason for the visit to the healthcare facility: \u2022 Urgency attention service: Patients in need of urgent medical attention, which could not have been scheduled in advance. Patients who visit this health service are ranked according to their health condition to ensure that healthcare is provided first to the patients who are most in need of care. \u2022 Elective/ambulatory attention service: Patients who visit a hospital due to a scheduled medical consultation. The majority of chronic patients fall in this category. \u2022 Hospitalization attention service: Patients who have to stay at a facility due to preparation for, performance of, or recovery from a medical procedure or surgery. Although the sub-processes in each service may vary among centers, at least these three types of services are common to every healthcare center. Service provisioning for chronic patients occurs in the elective/ambulatory attention service. The multiple participants in the process, the need for remote follow-up, the need for accurate and detailed data, alarms to coordinate efforts in case of emergency and the need for tools to motivate the patient to be consistent with his/her course of action renders chronic disease a challenging topic in modern medicine. Some examples of these challenges are as follows: Remote and in hospital monitoring, at home and in hospital treatments, communication among multiple stakeholders, organizational processes to keep track of the patient, and motivation of the patient and support network. The elective/ambulatory attention service is composed of three sub-processes detailed in Fig. 1 : Medical evaluation, treatment planning and specialist control consultation. The complexity, specifically for the case of the chronic outpatient monitoring process, lies in the number of activities and stakeholders. The first sub-process is the medical evaluation, in which the total health condition of the patient is assessed. The second sub-process involves the treatment planning, in which the total strategy to address a patient\u2019s follow-up is determined. This plan may include medication, in hospital or remote therapies, and lifestyle changes. In the third sub-process, responsible healthcare professionals follow the patient\u2019s vitals and evolution. We describe each of these sub-processes. \u2022 Medical Evaluation: This stage starts with a patient\u2019s visit to a doctor\u2019s office. The doctor will conduct basic steps to diagnose the patient: Examination of existing clinical data (physical or digital storage), anamnesis, and physical exam. After these steps, the doctor may ask for extra exams if needed. \u2022 Treatment planning: Once the diagnosis has been determined, the treating medic or medical staff proceeds to the design of the treatment for the patient. The process starts by considering possible courses of treatment; depending on the chosen treatment, the patient may have to be hospitalized. With these decisions, the treatment design starts, including evaluation of controls with other specialists, evaluation of medications, and assessment of remote monitoring needs. \u2022 Specialist control consultation: specialist monitors and evaluates the evolution of the patient in this stage. After a physical examination, and based on the patient\u2019s records and exams, the treating specialist decides whether to modify the current treatment. The process description presented in this section includes multiple constraints to be satisfied by the proposed framework. The framework should support the processes and data management, decision support tools, and treatment\u2019s stakeholder coordination. In the next section, we decompose these constraints into the system\u2019s requirements, and subsequently, into technical solutions for the proposed framework. 3.2 High level functional requirements From the previous BPMN analysis and existing work a number of conclusion can be drawn. Firstly healthcare processes are extremely complex since they incorporate multiple roles participating in each process and have several specialists working together on shared tasks [76,77]. On top of these complexities the integration of multiple tasks into the patient\u2019s treatment in the hospital and the monitoring of the treatment outside the hospital brings the necessity to coordinate and integrate multiple process around the patient [78,77]. Finally the need to constantly reduce costs while improving the quality of service [79] makes of the management of knowledge a key component to provide better healthcare with the best resource utilization. Puting all of the above together we identify four main high-level requirements for any support system design to assist chronic patients: Stakeholders coordination, data management, knowledge management and service orchestration. Table 1 lists these requirements. \u2022 Stakeholders\u2019 coordination: On top of the previously explained need to coordinate medical and organizational staff around the patient, it is also necessary to empower the patient and his social support network to succeed in chronic patients\u2019 treatment [7]. The importance of empowering different stakeholders is apparent when the approach to chronic patients switches from a passive approach to an active approach. The involvement of the patient and his/her social environment is paramount when considering that the majority of treatments occur outside of a hospital without the presence of healthcare professionals. The coordination of stakeholders is then paramount to control the associated costs of inefficiencies due to the misuse of human resources. \u2022 Data Management: Data are central in terms of a patient\u2019s past information and the follow-up of the current state of the patient. Medical staff have to consult and/or update the patient\u2019s information for every process of the service provisioning. That is, registration of the patient\u2019s pathologies, verification of patient\u2019s clinical information and update in the medical evaluation. High volumes of low-level context information from sensors and other data sources must be remotely collected and handled for its storage and processing (i.e., vitals follow-up during specialist control consultation). In the case of chronic patients, note that the data management tasks must be driven anywhere and anytime to satisfy the requirements of a Ubicomp system. On top of this declarative data, the procedural data has to be handled to allow CGI composition and sharing. \u2022 Knowledge management: As presented in Section 2, this topic has focused on specific chronic diseases. We note that the management of medical procedures \u2013 imperative and procedural \u2013 is essential in the treatment of any chronic patient, i.e., seek possible treatment in treatment planning. These processes take the form of procedures that can be nested \u2013 diagnosis and treatment or treatment and monitoring in specialist control and consultation. Therefore, the management of these processes must enable compensability, easy reconfiguration of the composition, and reutilization for new processes (either for treatment or diagnosis). \u2022 Service orchestration: The interweaving between medical and organizational processes renders the organization of these processes a primary requirement for the healthcare provisioning of chronic patients. Specific processes must be orchestrated to occur within a medical context (scheduling), to provide relevant information when needed (specific monitoring) and to enable communication among multiple stakeholders (alarm systems) 3.3 Technical approaches We present numerous technical solutions to address the requirements elicited from the analysis presented in the previous subsection. They are distributed computing, ontology support, process orchestration, and context awareness \u2013 see Table 2 . \u2022 Distributed computing: A chronic patient\u2019s treatment involves multiple activities with multiple responsibilities and large amounts of heterogeneous data. Distributed computing proposes a \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d approach to complex problems, in which large complex problems are split into smaller problems and encapsulated into components to offer specific solutions and ensure a structured connection between two components to solve the large initial problems. Following this strategy, the proposed framework should include specific and connected layers to address the various challenges for a chronic patient\u2019s treatment application framework. In this manner, this approach provides solutions to the following issues: stakeholders\u2019 coordination and data management. \u2022 Ontology support: Knowledge management is a cornerstone problem of healthcare support systems [29,43,80,9,81\u201384]. The ontological approach is vastly utilized for knowledge representation, storage as well as for inference problems in healthcare provisioning support applications for chronic patients. \u2022 Process orchestration: As explained in Section 3.1, medical guidelines are adapted to the specific organizational conditions in the form of organizational processes and clinical pathways, which can be represented and composed into more complex procedures. Process orchestration mechanisms interweave and compose organizational processes and clinical pathways, in cooperation with the ontology support. \u2022 Context awareness: Context involves more than the medical context; it may also include social, spatial, and emotional contexts, among others. These contexts are essential in healthcare provisioning but are paramount in communication with a patient (i.e., to send a reminder of an appointed consultation) and to coordinate support during the treatment (i.e., keep relevant individuals informed of the patient\u2019s condition) or fusion low-level context to infer high-level context (e.g., automatic assessment of crisis risk). Therefore, the framework must provide mechanisms to support context awareness in support of the functional requirements of stakeholders\u2019 coordination, knowledge management, and service orchestration. In the next section, we describe the architectural framework that realizes the integration of the described technical approaches. 4 Proposed solution We present the proposed solution to satisfy the described challenges. The solution is designed in three steps. First, we redesign the processes described in Section 3.1 and extend them to include data and knowledge management capabilities and provide general decision-making support, context awareness, and information systems functionalities. Second, we present the software architecture of the framework based on the technical approaches in Section 3.3. Third, we present a semantic description model and a semantic matching similarity mechanism, which are paramount to the application of medical knowledge in the treatment of chronic patients, as mentioned in Sections 3.2 and 3.3. 4.1 Business process model redesign The business process models presented in Section 3.1 represent general guidelines for healthcare provisioning to chronic patients. In this section, we present a redesign of these business process models, including the capabilities needed to support the functional requirements. \u2022 Assisted Medical Evaluation: As shown in Fig. 2 a, we include support activities for a medical professional and a patient. For the medical professional, the diagnosis is assisted by the automated search for a diagnosis based on the updated patient\u2019s clinical information, which is remotely accessed by the support systems (i.e., an ad hoc application owned by the hospital). The support system provides any findings to the professional to ensure that a diagnosis can be made with all available information. If the doctor makes a distinct diagnosis, the new pathological information related to the user can be updated. Note that a support service can be used to handle the scheduling of a medical exam, which removes the organizational responsibility from the patient and the medical personnel. \u2022 Assisted Treatment Planning: This process is enhanced with support activities to diagnose, automate follow-up, and handle organizational processes. As shown in Fig. 2b, the search for treatment is assisted by an automated service that provides the medical staff with information for an evaluation. With a defined treatment plan, two main activities are needed to prepare: define the monitoring needs and schedule the medical checkups in the healthcare center. The latter can be assisted by the same support as in the Assisted Medical Evaluation sub-process, whereas the former is more complex due to the nature of a chronic patient. The continuous monitoring of vitals is a desirable and important part of any treatment; however, it is not easily accomplished due to technical issues. We include the necessary activity of defining vitals and health indicators and their parameters to configure applications that can realize remote monitoring. With the given information, the support system can automate the treatment follow-up and evaluate its efficiency between medical checkups. \u2022 Signal Control and Alarm Generation: Fig. 2c shows this automatic process that supports the extended Specialist Control Consultation (SCC) sub-process. It starts with an update of the patient\u2019s parameters and terminates with a notification to the relevant stakeholder \u2013 medical personnel, patient, or patient\u2019s relatives. \u2022 Assisted Treatment Control and Monitoring: This process undergoes the largest number of changes, which reflects the current technical advancements in computer science applied to healthcare. The new designed process extends the former SCC sub-process and adds the System Control and Alarm Management activity prior to this. As depicted in Fig. 2d This new process provides input to the consultation and keeps track of a patient\u2019s vitals when he is not at the hospital. This data-gathering mechanism is useful for providing not only better information about the patient but also alarms that can warn the treating medical professionals, the patient\u2019s support network, and the patient about dangerous vital readings. Particularly this process is assisted by the Health Index and Medical Alarms History Checkup, Treatment Evaluation, and Search for Treatment activities. All previously presented activities aim to provide better information for the healthcare professional to assess a patient\u2019s condition. 4.1.1 U-health services The redesign in 4.1 presents numerous new activities that are employed in the different stages of a chronic patient\u2019s treatment. These new functionalities can be grouped in a specific category of healthcare processes services (u-health services), as shown in Table 3 . These ubiquitous services, available anywhere and anytime, are shared among every patient attention process and can be understood as functionalities that support and coordinate clinical pathways and organizational processes. Note that these u-health services are derived from the general case of healthcare provisioning to chronic patient and are general for any chronic patient. Specifically, ten invariant u-health services can be identified from the analysis in Section 4.1. These invariant u-health services follow a logic in their implementations described in Fig. 3 . As shown, the process always starts with a service request and terminates with the final handling of the requested or selected service. Note that Fig. 3 presents a general process for the handling of different requests. \u2022 High-level context generation: As explained in 2.3, high-level context is information that must be understood from low-level context. Low-level contextual information \u2013 a patient\u2019s temperature, location or the day of the week \u2013 must be fusioned and processed to understand the specific high-level contextual information that comprises the input to the process selection. For instance, \u201ca patient had a fever last Sunday while at home\u201d. The framework feeds this information to the specific service in the medical context ontology that contains the knowledge to extract such a high-level context. \u2022 U-health service selection: The goal of this activity is to determine the best suitable u-health services to respond to a patient\u2019s high-level context and its requirements. In this activity, the most suitable u-health service is selected according to a scoring algorithm that ranks all suitable candidates based on the specific requirements. The context for each candidate service is semantically compared with the context of the patient using a similarity function. The best suitable candidate is selected based on the semantic rank, and the service definitions are then extracted from the service repository explained in Section 4.2.2. In its turn, Section 4.3.2 proposes a semantic comparison mechanism to implement a semantic similarity ranking function that illustrates a possible implementation. 4.2 Framework architecture We introduce the architecture design to apply the approaches of distributed computing, ontology support, process orchestration and context awareness, which are considered to support the functional requirements identified in Section 3.2. Following the discussion in the literature we implement the interoperability as a design principle for our architecture. Interoperability has been cited as a main issue in the effective implementation of medical support systems having two main dimensions [85\u201387]: sharing of medical records on the patient and sharing treatments and processes. While different in implementation the approaches mentioned above apply the concept of abstraction between the description of data structures and the actual data values. In other words interoperability is achieved through data and process abstraction. On one hand markup languages have been systematically used to improve data sharing and usage between CDSS [88,11,89,76]. On the other hand Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) have been proposed to allow process and CGI interoperability [90,85]. In the case of patients\u2019 reports, markup language tag the data values with data description [88,11,89]. In the case of process SOA is used to encapsulate complex functionalities with annotations to describe its characteristics, required inputs and outputs. These annotations allow the systems to interpret the data received (from patients or processes), process, store, and use it. Our framework allows interoperability by providing both data abstraction and processes abstraction. Data abstraction is provided at the data publishing layer by the \u201cFormating manager\u201d where patients data is transformed to medical info by tagging \u2013 formating \u2013 it according to any specified standard \u2013 HL7, openEHR, etc. \u2013 (Section 4.2.4). Finally, process abstraction is achieved through BPMN description of CGI and process workflows and ontologies to keep the formal representation of these processes (Section 4.2.2, \u201cProcess Ontology Manager\u201d and \u201cService Ontology Managers\u201d). Fig. 4 presents a total description of the layered architecture proposed for the framework, including four major layers: data gathering, data storage, data processing, and data publication. This four-layered architecture presents the benefits of a distributed architecture, which enables the separation of the different concerns involved in the deployment of the support system, reusability of existing computational modules, and scalability as needed by increasing the computing capability of each specific layer. In the following section, we describe the modular design of the proposed architecture. 4.2.1 Data gathering layer This layer addresses the data input to the system. These data can be either a patient\u2019s bio signals or medical information from either guidelines or protocols to handle the patient\u2019s knowledge and pure medical knowledge. This layer addresses the difficulty of collecting patients\u2019 data from remote locations with a limited connection and mobility requirements for storage. Fig. 5 a shows the interactions among different stakeholders and the data gathering and data storage layers. Two types of interactions are supported: patient sensors data gathering and user interaction data. Each type of interaction poses a different data type with different characteristics and different management at this layer. The data from sensors are abundant \u2013 10th of records per second or more \u2013 and simple \u2013 few bytes per reading. The interaction between the users and the system is supported via a Web interface. These data and interactions are supported by the implementation of two different interfaces: A raw data API to receive the sensor\u2019s data, and a Web application to support other users\u2019 interactions with the system. Two distinct modules \u2013 a Web server and a data gathering module \u2013 compose the layer. On the Web server side, the user interactions are handled according to the inputted information. Users can interact to either input knowledge data or information about a patient\u2019s specific follow-up. The data gathering module specifies the gathering of a large number of biosignals from the patient and is implemented as a Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) server [91]. MQTT is a protocol used for machine-to-machine communication in the Internet of Things. This protocol is oriented to sensors\u2019 communication because it consumes quite few broadband and can be used in a majority of limited resources (CPU, RAM) devices, such as Smartphones or microcontrollers. In the data gathering module the information for certain data must be preprocessed. After this, the API manager sends these data to the storage layer. 4.2.2 Data storage layer This layer addresses the problem of storing the captured data from the upper layer in a meaningful manner, and making the data available for the processing layer. As shown in Fig. 5b, four distinct modules manage the storage of each different data type and their interfaces to other layers: The process ontology manager, the service discovery ontology manager, the structured data manager, and the raw data manager. All managers handle requests via an API manager. Although the technical details of each API manager differ, they share the same architectural purpose and functionalities. They aim to encapsulate the tasks of communication apart from the storage logic, which can be very complex for some data types, such as the medical knowledge. The API provides the minimal functionalities for receiving and storing data and data querying. We present the modules that comprise data gathering. \u2022 Process/Activity Ontology Manager: This module organizes the medical information into ontologies to be used by the u-health service selection. \u2022 Medical Processes Ontology: Collects, models, and describes the existing clinical pathways. \u2022 Medical context and contextual services Ontology: Models the medical knowledge associated with chronic patients. Gathers and describes the definitions of the services to detect context. \u2022 Actors Ontology: Models the participants in the healthcare provisioning for chronic patients. \u2022 Service Discovery Ontology Manager: This module retains all available services that are needed to provide u-health services. The services are stored in an ontology that enables a meaningful organization. The ontological approach is described in Section 4.3. \u2022 Structured Data Manager: This data repository stores all data that can be stored in the shape of tables, including any existing healthcare systems\u2019 database. Examples of the stored data are medical records, facility infrastructure, personnel shift schedules and prices, among others. \u2022 Raw Data Manager: This repository stores the biomedical data captured from the patient in a set of files in non-structured format \u2013 such as Java Script Object Notation (JSON) [92]. The usage of non-structured repositories is dependent on the nature of the data: large numbers, simple, and with high frequency. The purpose of this layer is to address the complexity of the incoming data and make the data available in a format that is useful for the next layer\u2019s processing activities. 4.2.3 Data processing layer This layer handles the extraction of high-level context and the u-health services selection and instantiation. As shown in Fig. 6 a this layer inputs from the data storage layer and outputs to the data publishing layer. This layer has three main modules: The context manager, process manager, and business process engine. \u2022 Context Manager: The context manager handles the transformation from low-level context data to high-level contextual information. For instance, based on a temporal series of a patient\u2019s vitals, a classification algorithm may predict a certain level of crisis risk. The raw data collector module receives a patient\u2019s remotely gathered information and passes it to the patient monitoring module and the high-level context generator module. The first module detects and cleans any data abnormalities. \u2022 Process Manager: This module handles the semantic matching between the user context and the existing u-health services. Based on the mechanism explained in Section 4.3.2, the better suited u-health services are selected. \u2022 Business Process Engine: This module executes the process selected in the process manager module by selecting and composing different services in the service ontology to realize the selected health process. 4.2.4 Data publication layer This layer handles the publication of information for the specific deployment tools used by different stakeholders and third-party applications. This layer is key in terms of interoperability; it is responsible for not only making available the existing ontology information but also parsing the information to fit specific formats for consumption. It is in this layer, specifically in the \u201cFormatting manager\u201d, where information is made available accordingly to any of the multiple existing standards for medical information representation (such as HL7 family standards [88], openEHR [89], etc.). Two types of information are published: contextual information and procedural information. As shown in Fig. 6b, this layer inputs from the data processing layer and outputs to the end user via an API that previously cleans and formats the information. Note that the formatting process is abstracted; therefore, specifics and modifications are easily added. The three main modules of this layer are the data fetching manager, formatting manager, and presentation manager. \u2022 Data fetching manager: The fetching manager communicates to the data storage components of the framework. This manager is composed of three main consumers; each consumer is specialized in a specific data type and is responsible for handling any issue related to either communication and/or storage-related update or modification \u2013 inclusion of new data and unavailability of information. By adding this extra abstraction instance, the proper functioning and availability of the front API is enforced. \u2022 Formatting manager: The main purpose of this component is to support the transformation between existing information and existing \u2013 and evolving\u2013 formats for the consumption of data. The data are parsed to identify the specific information and their types from the different sources \u2013 i.e., temperature data, pre- or post-conditions of a process, and medical definitions \u2013 to prepare the data structure specified for consumption \u2013 for instance, a file describing a service by the Web Service Description Language (WSDL) [93] or a file described in HL7 for passing a patient\u2019s laboratory test. The specifics of the data structure are obtained from the ontology information. In this manner, the extensibility and support of new or updated structures are supported. \u2022 Presentation manager: This module\u2019s responsibility is to expose the relevant information to potential consumers and handle the access to the endpoints in terms of security and availability. Three different API exposes the information in a meaningful manner for any potential consumer: User data \u2013 clinical, monitoring, and alarms information \u2013, business process \u2013 medical or organizational services description \u2013 and medical knowledge \u2013 declarative, guidelines, and/or clinical pathways description. 4.3 Knowledge management An important challenge is the adaptability and extensibility of CDSS. The continuously changing and evolving medical knowledge imposes the same requirements for the support systems; they must be flexible to include new data and infer new knowledge. As previously mentioned, an ontology typically falls within the scope of a specific application, which hinders the reutilization of such knowledge. An ontology describes data as declarative or procedural, which indicates that knowledge may support processes \u2013 such as medical guidelines or pathways \u2013 or describe concepts such as disease definitions or medicine characteristics. The data support for complex CDSS must consider data integration information to ensure not only the usage of multiple data sources but also reutilization and easy consumption of the inferred new information. Table 4 depicts the knowledge types involved in the proposed framework. 4.3.1 Semantic description model In the following we introduce a semantic model that is functional to the presentation of the framework and not a standard medical ontology. Through this ontology we develop a proof of concept tested in Section 5. It is out of the scope of this work to propose a specific ontology, we aim to build up a framework that can easily modify its ontologies. In light of the extensive work on medical ontologies [94,95,69,70] our proposed ontology can be rectified through ontology alignment [96] or through the development of a specific ontology for chronic patients. The semantic model that supports the framework consists of three main ontologies, which encapsulates the declarative and procedural medical knowledge. Fig. 7 provides an overview of the entire knowledge management system, including the actors, medical context and contextual services, and process ontologies as the main ontologies. \u2022 Medical context and contextual services ontology: This ontology models the declarative knowledge concerning the patient\u2019s treatments. All concepts needed for the medical decisions, including the medical context and the contextual services information, are part of this ontology (see Fig. 8 ). The main modeled elements are patient\u2019s clinical and contextual information, healthcare related procedures, and context detection services. Every Patient has a Medical Context (hasMedicalContext), a Context Detection Service, a Monitoring Plan (hasPlan), a High-Level Context (hasHighLevelContext), and a set of Alarms (hasAlarm). Each class models the necessary concepts involved in the patient\u2019s healthcare process. The Medical Context refers to the medical information that defines the patient\u2019s condition. A Medical Context is defined by Symptoms and Signs (composedBySymptomsSigns), Syndromes (hasSindrome), Disease (composedByDisease) and Interventions (composedByIntevention). Symptoms and Signs are related to both Disease and Syndromes (isSignOfDisease and isSignOfSyndrome). Interventions are associated with Diseases and Syndromes in the relationship of isInterventionForSyndrome and isInterventionForDisease. The Monitoring Plan is a set of Indicators that is captured from the patient or his/her environment and used as input to a Context Detection Service. A Context Detection Service is associated with a Medical Context (associatedToMedicalContext) and has Dynamic Context (hasContextualService) and an Output Service (isOutput) to retrieve risk levels associated with the specific context related to the medical knowledge. The final main elements are the Alarms and the High-level Context. The former models the events associated with Patients (hasAlarm) that are triggered by abnormalities in his Dynamic Context (associatedToDynamicContext) and the subsequent communication with any relevant stakeholder (hasContact). The High-level Context addresses all relevant context in the patient\u2019s care provisioning: Ambiental Context, System Context, and Health Condition. \u2022 Process ontology: This ontology addresses the clinical procedural knowledge because it describes the available clinical pathways in the system (see Fig. 9 ). A clinical pathway is a Health Business Process that is described in BPMN 2.0; it may be a main Health Business Process or a specialization of another Health Business Process (isSpecializationOf in Fig. 9). For example, \u201cNormalize blood pressure\u201d is a clinical pathway in which all steps needed for this Health Business Process to occur are described in a BPMN 2.0 standard process. This Health Business Process is a specialization of the general \u201cControl blood pressures\u201d, which includes the \u201cNormalize blood pressure\u201d as part of the actions to follow if the patient\u2019s blood pressure is high. As shown in Fig. 9, every clinical pathway is described in terms of its activities (hasActivityDefition) and a set of Medical Context (supportsMedicalContext) and High-level Context (hasPrecondition) that are needed to trigger its execution. The ProcessInput (hasProcessInput) represents the specific variables that are needed to initiate its execution, and the ProcessOutput (hasProcessOutput) represents the final outcome of the Health Business Process. A clinical pathway may directly affect the patient\u2019s health condition; this effect is represented by the clinical pathway relationship with the Dynamic Context|hasEffect. An Effect is a High-level Context that opposes another High-level Context. In the previous example, \u201cNormalize blood pressure\u201d would have the effect of changing the patient\u2019s blood pressure attribute from \u201cHigh\u201d to \u201cNormal\u201d. \u2022 Actors ontology: Models all roles involved in a patient\u2019s healthcare provisioning and their relationships. Actors are represented by different profiles depending on their specific role in the patient\u2019s treatment. The profiles model the contact information in case it is required in an emergency. As shown in Fig. 10 , the classes that are modeled in this ontology are Actor, Individual, Group, Caregiver, Patient, and Professional. An Actor is a group of people or an Individual that is involved in providing healthcare to a chronic patient. Although each Group treats a Patient (treatsPatient), each Patient can be treated by either a Professional (isTreatedBy) or a Caregiver (isTakenCareBy). 4.3.2 Semantic similarity A context can be expressed as a vector that contains the values for the different context attributes \u2013 static and dynamic context. Therefore, the similarity between the two contexts C 1 and C 2 can be measured in terms of the similarity between the two vectors that represent C 1 and C 2 as the function sim ( C 1 , C 2 ) . In the literature this similarity is measured as the vectorial distance between the two concepts C 1 and C 2 [68]. For the scope of this paper, we propose a variation of the cosine similarity function for two vectors. Let sim process , patient = sim ( w \u2192 process , w \u2192 patient ) . This function measures the cosine between two vectors, as defined in Eq. (1): (1) sim ( w \u2192 process , w \u2192 patient ) = \u2211 i = 1 k w i , process \u00b7 w i , patient \u2211 i = 1 k w i , process 2 \u2211 i = 1 k w i , patient 2 where k is the union of the active patient contexts and process contexts. w \u2192 process and w \u2192 patient are the weighted vectors that represent the user context C 1 and the process context C 2 , as expressed in Eq. (2): (2) w i , p = 1 , element i is part of p context 0 , otherwise In the general case of semantic similarities, the weight is considered to be 0 if the element is not present in the vector W. This problem occurs in the case of the semantic comparison among hierarchized elements, such as in an ontology, since the similarity will be zero for any pair of elements that pertain to different classes. To address this problem, we employ the idea of weight to define a partially active context to extend the cosine similarity. In the comparison of two High-level contexts C 1 and C 2 , a partially active context for C 1 is defined as a non-active concept that is a subclass of an active context for C 2 . As shown in Fig. 11 , for the vector that describes the instance I 1 , only the C 4 weight will be not null. Likewise, only the C 2 weight will be 1 for the I 2 vector. However, applying the idea of partially active contexts, the weight of C 1 will be not null for I 1 , which accounts for the hierarchical structure defining the instance I 1 . We correct the value of a non-active context C n with the minimal number of nodes between C n and any other active context in the vector C 1 . 5 Evaluation In this section, we evaluate the proposed framework in terms of its pertinence to support chronic patients, user usability, and performance of key technical components. We investigate the pertinence and usability of the framework via a case study in a real environment with patients and staff from a pediatric hospital in Chile, and evaluate the technical performance using stress experiments of key technical components of the framework. The case study is used to illustrate how the redesigned business processes, the framework modules, and the ontologies are applied to a real case. 5.1 Case study: developing a support system for chronic respiratory patients The air pollution in the city of Santiago is a relevant driver for respiratory-related chronic diseases, particularly in children. The Exequiel Gonz\u00e1lez Cort\u00e9s Pediatric Hospital (EGCPH), which is the largest public pediatric hospital in Santiago, is constantly treating respiratory complications in children. This institution serves around 300,000 patients each year, most of them from a segment of the population with low incomes. Therefore, it is needed to support the children\u2019s follow-up, monitoring, and assessment of crisis risk. In accordance with our redesigned business processes, it is realized by the Assisted Treatment Control and Monitoring (ATCM) process (see Section 4.1). This case study was related to predicting a potential crisis of the patient through a health risk classification (high-level context), in order to anticipate a general state of potential seriousness, without necessarily associating it with a certain crisis. This was done by instantiating the high-level context generation process by means of an intelligent classification model based on fuzzy reasoning. This model evaluated the patient\u2019s risk of crisis from their vital signs. Then, based on that risk of crisis, suitable processes were selected, which were mapped to u-health services to meet the needs of the patient. In addition, a set of services that were developed to support the management of alerts is shown once a patient, her caregiver, and her doctor had been notified of a potential health crisis. It is worth to note that in this case study we did not consider the patient\u2019s initial medical evaluation; that is, we considered existing patients already diagnosed, with a defined treatment and being remotely monitored. Table 5 shows the relationship between the supported processes, instantiated u-health services, and specific service implementations. We illustrate our methods by describing the instantiation of the ATCM process, one of the three main processes of a patient\u2019s treatment (presented in 4.1). The ATCM is composed of two sub-processes: Signal Control and Alarm Generation (SCAG), and Assisted Specialist Control Consultation. As shown in Fig. 2d, SCAG provides input to the consultation and keeps track of the patient\u2019s vitals. That is done by activating the automated subprocesses Ubiquitous Health Services (UHS), and Notify Relevant Stakeholders. UHS activates the subprocesses Generate High-level Context and Select Ubiquitous Services. 5.1.1 High-level context generation example The EGCPH doctors have defined that the respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), temperature (T), and oxygen saturation (OS) in the blood are vital signs necessary to evaluate the level of crisis risk in pediatric patients with chronic respiratory disease. As mentioned, in this case study the level of risk of crisis of the patient corresponds to a high level context. Vital signs were monitored remotely by a set of non-invasive biosensors, such as electrocardiograms, oximeters, thermometers, among others. Vital signs were recorded every two or four hours, depending on whether the patient was in the intensive care unit in one case, or in the pediatric unit or domicile in the other. The Data Gathering and Transition Layer is in charge of this capture. Then, the patient\u2019s vitals are stored in the Raw Data Manager of the Storage Layer. The high-level context generation is a core automated subprocess implemented in the Data Processing Layer of the Framework as a specific module of the Context Manager. This module periodically receives patients\u2019 vitals from the Raw Data Collector, which gathers the data from the aforementioned Storage Layer. The Raw Data Collector is part of an application that runs on a micro-controller configured to transmit the signals of these devices, which are stored in servers owned by the hospital. The details of the hardware are beyond the scope of this paper. The high-level context generation has a diversity of services to produce high-level context out of raw data. In this case study this service consisted of a pre-trained model for predicting respiratory crisis risk. This model was obtained from the Context Detection Service resource by running a SPARQL query in the medical context and contextual services ontology. The generation of the model was carried out by physicians and analysts, who are supported by a semi-automated process manager process each time the model does not reach a certain level of specificity and accuracy. That is, the model has become obsolete or its parameters must be adjusted. The first activity of this process was to define, on the part of the doctors, a set of specific reference ranges for different age segments of the patients, whether for HR, T, or RR. These ranges represent the upper and lower acceptable limits for these vital signs. In this case study, regardless of age, the normal range of T was established between 36 and 37.5\u202f\u00b0C, while the OS was established between 96 and 100. Second, physicians developed a scoring scheme to characterize different states of these vital signs, as shown in Table 6 . For example, if the patient only showed a high or low temperature, she was assigned a score of 1. However, if the patient showed a low respiratory rate, then she was assigned a score of 3. Once the scoring scheme was established, it was necessary to define the correspondence between the combination of the vital signs scores and the risk of a respiratory crisis, as shown in Table 7 . This knowledge was formalized in the form of functions, as shown in Eqs. (3)\u2013(5). These equations define three membership functions to denote a high range (HRA), normal range (NRA) and low range (LRA) of a variable. (3) HRA i ( x ) = 0 if x < c i ( x - c i ) ( d i - c i ) if c i \u2a7d x \u2a7d d i 1 if x > d i (4) NRA i ( x ) = 0 if x < a i or x > d i ( x - a i ) ( b i - a i ) if a i \u2a7d x \u2a7d b i 1 if b i \u2a7d x \u2a7d c i ( d i - x ) ( d i - c i ) if c i \u2a7d x \u2a7d d i (5) LRA i ( x ) = 0 if x > b i ( b i - x ) ( b i - a i ) if a i \u2a7d x \u2a7d b i 1 if x < a i where for each vital sign i, its lower limit is denoted as Mini and its upper limit as Maxi. Additionally, two variables are introduced per limit to introduce flexibility to these measures: FlexMini and FlexMaxi respectively. In this way, the parameters for membership functions are written as follows: (6) a i = Mini \u2217 ( 1 - FlexMini ) i \u2208 { T , RR , HR } (7) b i = Mini \u2217 ( 1 + FlexMini ) i \u2208 { T , RR , HR } (8) c i = Maxi \u2217 ( 1 - FlexMaxi ) i \u2208 { T , RR , HR } (9) d i = Maxi \u2217 ( 1 + FlexMaxi ) i \u2208 { T , RR , HR } Eqs. (6)\u2013(9) are used as a diffuse reasoning model, which is added to the medical context and contextual service ontology as an instance of the Context Detection Service resource. The calibration of the model was carried out through the similarity with which it classified the risk of crisis with respect to the reasoning of several expert doctors. The parameters that relaxed the limits of the intervals were adjusted until the reasoning of the model was very similar to that of the medical evaluators. Results. The model obtained was executed with the vital signs of 31 patients with chronic respiratory disease, under the authorization of the HEGC ethics committee, measured to assess the contingent risk level of the patient: no risk, low risk, medium or moderate risk, high risk. The model was tested without individualizing the records, using 80% of the data to train and 20% to evaluate. The approach without individualization is similar to what health personnel do most of the time in the triage, in which it is assumed that people behave similarly. Obviously it is necessary to explore the case in which the patient is individualized, for which it is necessary to use other classification methods than fuzzy logic. The model obtained a specificity of 78% and an accuracy of 79.3%. In this scenario, doctors are more interested in specificity than in accuracy. It is important to note that in this case study, for illustrative purposes, we used the developed diffuse reasoning model that integrated the expert judgment of the EGCPH doctors. However, it is perfectly possible to do it with another classification model. Nevertheless, this example shows how the framework \u2013 processes, ontologies, and modules \u2013 can be utilized in a real scenario. In this way, the patient\u2019s risk level corresponds to a high-level context generated by the Context Manager, which is transmitted to the Process Manager. Subsequently, this newly generated high-level context was used to identify a set of candidate processes, as explained in the next section. 5.1.2 Ubiquitous services selection example Whenever the high-level context consists of the level of risk and the identification of the patient, the Process Selector extracts from the process ontology those processes that satisfy that the composedByDisease property of the Medical Context resource and hasRiskLevel property of the Dinamic Context resource exactly match the high-level context. Because in this case study the level of risk of crisis of the patient could be critical, a partial matching was not accepted in this case. By applying the obtained high-level context to the Process Manager module of the framework, the following processes were selected: \u2022 When the prediction of the patient\u2019s risk level of crisis consisted of low risk, the Process Selector obtained the \u201dGeneral Info and Alerting Service\u201d health business process. This process in turn consisted of the processes labeled as \u201dNotifying Low Risk to Caregiver\u201d and \u201dProviding Basic Care Recommendations\u201d, within others Health Business Process. These processes have definitions represented in BPMN, which were parsed by the Process Parser module, obtaining a coordination logic composed of two sequential activities: \u201dObtaining Caregiver\u201d and \u201dObtaining Caregiver Contact Information\u201d. The sequence continued with a parallel pattern with an OR-SPLIT gateway of three branches \u2013 \u201dSending Notification to Smartphone\u201d, \u201dSending e-mail\u201d, and a third branch composed of a sequence of \u201dIdentifying Patient\u2019s Doctor\u201d and \u201dAssigning Telephone Call to Doctor\u201d. According to the BPMN representation of \u201dProviding Basic Care Recommendations\u201d, the entry of the first activity consisted of a literal with the patient\u2019s identifier, and its result in a literal with the identifier of the Caregiver. The services that implemented the \u201dObtaining Caregiver Contact Information\u201d activity consisted of two SPARQL queries, where the first joined both the identifier and the isTakenCareBy properties of the Patient resource. The second used the caregiver\u2019s identifier by joining the hasContactInformation property of the Caregiver resource, and generated as output an array of literals with three spaces, where the first represented the caregiver\u2019s mobile phone number, the second her email, and the third her fixed phone. \u2022 Similarly, when the prediction of the patient\u2019s risk level of crisis consisted of medium or high risk, the Process Selector obtained from the \u201dGeneral Info and Alerting Service\u201d health business process the process labeled as \u201dNotifying Medium-High Risk to Caregiver and Doctor\u201d, within other processes. The only difference of this process is that both the caregiver and the doctor were notified of the patient\u2019s risk level. Fig. 12 shows sample mobile services to manage alerts and patient health records information that anticipate respiratory crisis and deploy patient\u2019s vitals. Examples of services are as follows: \u2022 General information and Alerting service: This service provides general information and information related to the issued alarms received by a patient. Among the general information provided, his chronic diagnosis and data about his last crisis can be counted. A list of the generated alerts and their status is also shown. \u2022 Patient overview display service: This service provides the patient\u2019s baseline health indicators for each vital sign, initial diagnosis and previous crisis. \u2022 Patient\u2019s vital follow up service: This service enables healthcare professionals to follow the evolution of a patient in terms of the evolution of multiple indicators by providing raw data and graphic visualizations of the indicators within different time frames (i.e., last 24\u202fh). \u2022 Temporal analysis service: This service performs an analysis of any health indicator within a chosen time interval. 5.1.3 Service evaluation The usefulness and usability of these services are validated by a user study with health professionals of the EGCPH. Three test cases are analyzed for patients in the following age groups: two months, fourteen months and eight years. The emulation is performed using a Web form, where vital signs are entered on a tablet device. The mobile service GUIs are deployed on a Smartphone. This emulation is validated by a survey (16 health professionals) that uses a Likert scale of five levels. The sample consists of 6% nurses, 19% physicians, and 75% physiotherapists. As shown in Table 8 , every evaluated item has an average greater or equal to 4.0, which indicates that users consider the services useful (100%), easy to use (81%) and capable of triggering preventive actions in a timely manner (81%). In relation to preventive notifications, 63% of the health notifications regarding patient\u2019s risk; 19% of the health professionals strongly agree. In relation to preventive notifications, 63% agree that the services generate appropriate notifications regarding the patient\u2019s risk, and 19% strongly agree with this. We use the Cronbach\u2019s alpha indicator as a proxy to assess the reliability of the sample. This indicator is based on the following parameters: number of items, average covariance within a couple of items, and the variance of the total score. Cronbach\u2019s alpha of the sample has a value of 0.84 for a total of nine items and 16 people. This indicator shows excellent internal consistency of the sample, which indicates that the results are very reliable. We conduct a statistical analysis of the results to determine the confidence interval for each item with 95% confidence. As shown in Table 8, the best rated items correspond to the usefulness (item 2) and attractiveness (item 1) of the services. The worst evaluated item corresponds to the usability (item 3) of the services and notifications based on patient risk. These results indicate that the main areas for improvement are related to the services\u2019 GUI to facilitate navigation within them and how the information associated with the patient status is displayed. However this is out of the scope of the framework capabilities. A correlation analysis is performed to provide insights about the features that users value. The results indicate that items with high correlation with the total assessment of the services are the item related to the generation of appropriate notifications based on patient risk (item 7, correlation 0.84) and the item regarding the capacity to review relevant patient data (item 4, correlation 0.73). 5.2 Framework technical evaluation In this section, we test the ubiquitous acquisition and transfer of patient\u2019s vitals and the ontological approach to select and compose services. Both of these issues may jeopardize the total feasibility and functionality of the framework. 5.2.1 Architectural support to ubiquitous data acquisition and transmission The goal of this evaluation is to test the performance of the proposed architectural scheme for the remote data gathering and uploading to the cloud storage. We stress the implementation of the proposed data gathering structured using multiple signals, multiple frequencies, and different configurations of the sensors. The technical implementation is depicted in Figs. 13 and 14 . The communication between the docking station and the sensors is accomplished by the usage of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol. The docking station consumes the Web service that is used to upload and store the captured data to a cloud storage service (Amazon\u2019s S3 service). The docking station is implemented as a software that is written using the node.js programming language and run on a raspberry pi 4.0. The performance of the architectural implementation was measured in terms of throughput. A set of experiments was conducted to determine these technical parameters to determine the feasibility of the framework and support the technical specifications in the patient\u2019s vitals for healthcare-related processes. The stress experiment implies the sensing of multiple sensors in different conditions to understand the limitations that determine the suitability of this scheme to realize the ubiquitous data gathering. Specifically, we employ an accelerometer/gyroscope, a photoplethysmograph (PPG), and a temperature sensor in repeated trials. Each trial is composed of an arrangement of sensors; each sensor is set to capture data at a certain frequency. Each trial included ten runs of each specific arrangement and frequency setting. As an example, the first trial includes the data gathering and transmission of the data sensed by the PPG in the range of 50 and 100\u202fHertz (Hz). Two sets of data are employed: the first set contains ten runs of PPG data captured at 50\u202fHz, and the set contains ten runs captured at 100\u202fHz. The results per data series is then reported as an average with a standard deviation. Table 9 shows the sensor arrangement and the frequencies considered for each data source (in parenthesis with units of Hz). The data from each sensor are locally stored in files that contain one second of information in each file. These one-second packages are uploaded and stored in an S3 bucket. This bucket is our representation of the unstructured raw data storage. We evaluate the performance in terms of the transmission throughput defined as the data packets per second. In this manner, we measure the effective data captured by the sensors and transmitted to the storage layer. As shown in Table 9, when the three sensors are simultaneously employed, a high-capturing frequency, the current setting exhibits some problems. According to the literature, the frequency of data capture is substantially lower than the maximum supported by the current settings. 5.2.2 Ontological matching performance for process filtering and composition A major issue is the management of ontologies and the ontological operations to perform in real time with minimum performance standards. We stress an implementation of the ontology proposed in Section 4.3.1 and the matching and composition algorithms proposed in Section 4.3.2. Tests were performed using an Intel i5 PC (2.5\u202fGHz) with 8\u202fGB RAM and a 1\u202fTb hard drive. The software was executed using the Java Development Kit (JDK) version 1.8.1. Therefore, the modular architectural seems to be sufficient for supporting the healthcare requirements. The semantic matching and selection of services according to the user needs was measured in terms of the execution time of the u-health services proposed in Section 4.1.1 and the memory usage of the semantic matching algorithm proposed in Section 4.3.2. We test the feasibility of these processes for a large number of services and patients. The service selection algorithm was executed multiple times for different sizes of the process ontology (different number of nodes). For each run, the average memory usage and running time was measured. Instances of testing were run for 100, 1000, 10,000, and 100,000 processes. Fig. 15 a and b present the results for the experiments. The performance of the proposed algorithms presents a linear trend that increases with the complexity of the process (number of processes in the ontology) but always within reasonable times of execution and memory usage to support real-time processes. In terms of the average time to select and match u-health services with the specific patient\u2019s context, the growth is linear with time and bounded to 100,000\u202fms (less than two minutes). Although the linearity of the algorithm is not a great quality, it is kept under a reasonable time to support real-time processes. The memory usage for the execution is bounded by 10\u202fMb to the existence of 100,000 services in the ontology. The algorithm is linear in the time variable. Even the variance in the memory is considerable depending on the number of processes in the ontology; it is not a relevant problem in the implementation of a support system or application. 6 Discussion By using a BPMN approach to the analysis of the healthcare organization this paper delivers a powerful framework that incorporates all steps involved in the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of chronic patients in the healthcare environment \u2013 unlike specific u-health apps and CDSS, see Sections 2.2 and 2.4. This environment is extended beyond hospitals and incorporates remote medical staff and a patient\u2019s social support network. This framework is not a substitution of all important advances in support of the chronic patient but is a structure that incorporates and organizes existing approaches and efforts in the patient\u2019s diagnosis and treatment processes. This framework allows flexibility to store and create new knowledge (ontology) and reusability to quickly build on the shoulders of existing applications (software architecture) with the best information and suitable services for the patient (ubiquitous monitoring, u-health services, and semantic matching). As a framework we step away from CIG-based CDSS (Section 2.4) by managing the whole patient care cycle including in-hospital and out-hospital follow up. Our framework is independent of specific standards as it abstracts the details of implementations into functional components taking care of that. The \u201cFormatting manager\u201d handles different standards independently of the data stored in the system. In addition, the \u201cOntology manager\u201d handles ontology alignment with standards or incorporates completely new medical ontologies. We believe it is important to clarify that although the framework is independent of specific standards and that the module \u201dFormatting manager\u201d is capable of handling several of them, these were not considered in the case study to simplify its implementation. Likewise, the selection of health business processes is done by means of property matching between the process schema and the high-level context generated in the context manager plus the patient\u2019s medical context, implemented through a semantic distance. It is worthwhile to note that eventually another type of context can be included, such as location, social aspects, environmental conditions, among others, perfectly incorporated as high level context. The process composition is not done spontaneously, but is early binding. The spontaneous composition of processes is an interesting challenge and an active research issue, but unfortunately not yet sufficiently solved in the generic literature of BPM or service computing. The evaluation yields positive results in terms of the generality of our modeling, the feasibility of the implementation of the framework, and the technical approach to solve the semantic matching and data acquisition. We analyze some threats to the validity of our results and their impact on the conclusions we form in Section 7. \u2022 External: Specifics of each healthcare center adds to the complexity of the involved processes. The modeling presented in Section 3.1 addresses the base process to be implemented. Although our proposition may be enhanced, it covers the most general case. We propose a set of invariant services that comprise the base to any support system, equally or more complex than the set proposed in this study. \u2022 Construct: To mitigate the recommendation of inadequate processes, be it for diagnosis, treatment or monitoring, our framework makes a selection of process candidates. A score is calculated for each of these candidates according to the matching level given by the semantic distance, so that eventually a ranked candidate recommendation would be presented to the client. Therefore, our approach incorporates the human in the loop, who can choose the most appropriate health business process. The above is an approach frequently used in recommender systems in general and in CDSS in particular. Regarding the technical evaluation, process ontology and users are randomly set for each run of the tests, which is not realistic given that processes in real environments are specifically defined, and users follow certain profiles more than other profiles. Our results are resilient because they prove the suitability of our methods in terms of their performance. The efficiency of the ontology brokering would be affected with the type of ontology and the relationships among resources. Moreover, these are not the only factors that would have a negative effect on efficiency, but also the general inefficiency of the semantic Web engines that implement the application of queries in SPARQL, a challenge broadly recognized mainly by practitioners. However, there are several approaches that allow mitigating this challenge, in which one of the most widespread is to take advantage of the equivalence between ontology schemes and relational databases. There are several techniques to improve queries in this latter approach, such as indexing or efficient parsing heuristics. This discussion we leave out of reach of the paper for not contributing methodologically. 7 Conclusion In this paper, we present a framework for the building, deployment, and coordination of applications and systems that provide support of the attention of chronic patients. The primary contributions of this study are the formal description of the process of attention to chronic patients, the introduction of a software architecture to support the described processes, an ontology to store the medical and organizational knowledge in the attention of these patients, the description of a set of invariant services needed to support the treatment of chronic patients in the healthcare domain (u-health services), and a set of tools to solve the general issues of semantic matching and ubiquitous data acquisition for chronic patients. By modeling the attention of chronic patients as a business process, we describe this process in a general manner that is independent of the specific health conditions of the patient and physical facilities of the care provider. This process describes the patient\u2019s attention, including the complex interactions among multiple stakeholders (medical staff and the patient and his/her social support network) in various possible physical environments (in and out of the hospital). By considering the characteristics of knowledge in the healthcare environment, we propose a set of interconnected ontologies to store, query, and reason the declarative and procedural medical and organizational knowledge involved in the chronic patient treatment and diagnosis process. We propose a mechanism to achieve semantic process matching and ubiquitous data acquisition. We positively tested these mechanisms using a case study to prove the suitability and usability of applications in the framework. As future work from the methodological point of view, we plan to analyze and include existing medical domain ontologies into our framework by developing an ontology alignment method. We also plan to enrich the Context Manager with novel methods of high-level context generation. Conflict of interest None.

This trend addresses the important problem of chronic illnesses, highlighted by multiple international organizations as a core issue in future healthcare. Despite the myriad of exciting new developments, each application and system is designed and implemented for specific purposes and lacks the flexibility to support different healthcare concerns. Some of the known problems of such developments are the integration issues between applications and existing healthcare systems, the reusability of technical knowledge in the creation of new and more sophisticated systems and the usage of data gathered from multiple sources in the generation of new knowledge. This paper proposes a framework for the development of chronic disease support systems and applications as an answer to these shortcomings. Through this framework our pursuit is to create a common ground methodology upon which new developments can be created and easily integrated to provide better support to chronic patients, medical staff and other relevant participants. General requirements are inferred for any support system from the primary attention process of chronic patients by the Business Process Management Notation. Numerous technical approaches are proposed to design a general architecture that considers the medical organizational requirements in the treatment of a patient. A framework is presented for any application in support of chronic patients and evaluated by a case study to test the applicability and pertinence of the solution.", "openArchiveArticle": "true",
