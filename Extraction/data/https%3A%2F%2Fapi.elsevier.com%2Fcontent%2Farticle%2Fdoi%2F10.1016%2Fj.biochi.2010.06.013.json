In this study, a simple and powerful computational method, which combines support vector machine with PSI-BLAST profile, is proposed to predict protein structural class for low-similarity sequences. The evolution information encoding in the PSI-BLAST profiles is converted into a series of fixed-length feature vectors by extracting amino acid composition and dipeptide composition from the profiles. The resulting vectors are then fed to a support vector machine classifier for the prediction of protein structural class. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, jackknife cross-validation tests are performed on two widely used benchmark datasets, 1189 (containing 1092 proteins) and 25PDB (containing 1673 proteins) with sequence similarity lower than 40% and 25%, respectively. The overall accuracies attain 70.7% and 72.9% for 1189 and 25PDB datasets, respectively. Comparison of our results with other methods shows that our method is very promising to predict protein structural class particularly for low-similarity datasets and may at least play an important complementary role to existing methods.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Protein structural class"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Sequence similarity"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Support vector machine"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Position-specific score matrix"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300908410002270", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300908410002270", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "77957124553", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-77957124553", "pubmed-id": "20600567", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77957124553", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20100623", "$": "2010-06-23"}}}}}
