Temporal abstraction (TA) provides the means to achieve such descriptions, which can then be used as input to a reasoning engine where they are evaluated against a knowledge base to arrive at possible clinical hypotheses. This paper surveys previous research into the development of intelligent clinical data analysis systems that incorporate TA mechanisms and presents research synergies and trends across the research reviewed, especially those associated with the multi-dimensional nature of real-time patient data streams. The motivation for this survey is case study based research into the development of an intelligent real-time, high-frequency patient monitoring system to provide detection of temporal patterns within multiple patient data streams.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  The survey was based on factors that are of importance to broaden research into temporal abstraction and on characteristics we believe will assume an increasing level of importance for future clinical IDA systems. These factors were: aspects of the data that is abstracted such as source domain and sample frequency, complexity available within abstracted patterns, dimensionality of the TA and data environment and the knowledge and reasoning underpinning TA processes.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion\n                  It is evident from the review that for intelligent clinical data analysis systems to progress into the future where clinical environments are becoming increasingly data-intensive, the ability for managing multi-dimensional aspects of data at high observation and sample frequencies must be provided. Also, the detection of complex patterns within patient data requires higher levels of TA than are presently available. The conflicting matters of computational tractability and temporal reasoning within a real-time environment present a non-trivial problem for investigation in regard to these matters. Finally, to be able to fully exploit the value of learning new knowledge from stored clinical data through data mining and enable its application to data abstraction, the fusion of data mining and TA processes becomes a necessity.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Temporal abstraction"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Intelligent data analysis"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Patient monitoring"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Decision support systems"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Intensive care"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Temporal reasoning"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0933365706001345", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365706001345", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "33845455091", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-33845455091", "pubmed-id": "17011175", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33845455091", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20060929", "$": "2006-09-29"}}}}}
