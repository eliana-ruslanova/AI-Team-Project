For each MeSH term, they found an optimal training set, a subset of the whole training set. An optimal training set consists of all documents including a given MeSH term (C\n                     1 class) and those documents not including a given MeSH term (C\n                     \u22121 class) that are closest to the C\n                     1 class. These small sets were used to predict MeSH assignments in the MEDLINE\u00ae database.\n               \n               \n                  Measurements\n                  Average precision was used to compare MeSH assignment using the na\u00efve Bayes learner trained on the whole training set, optimal sets, and random sets. The authors compared 95% lower confidence limits of average precisions of na\u00efve Bayes with upper bounds for average precisions of a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  For all 20 MeSH assignments, the optimal training sets produced nearly 200% improvement over use of the whole training sets. In 17 of those MeSH assignments, na\u00efve Bayes using optimal training sets was statistically better than a KNN. In 15 of those, optimal training sets performed better than optimized feature selection. Overall na\u00efve Bayes averaged 14% better than a KNN for all 20 MeSH assignments. Using these optimal sets with another classifier, C-modified least squares (CMLS), produced an additional 6% improvement over na\u00efve Bayes.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion\n                  Using a smaller optimal training set greatly improved learning with na\u00efve Bayes. The performance is superior to a KNN. The small training set can be used with other sophisticated learning methods, such as CMLS, where using the whole training set would not be feasible.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1067502708000649", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1067502708000649", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "45849122150", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-45849122150", "pubmed-id": "18436913", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/45849122150", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20080709", "$": "2008-07-09"}}}}}
