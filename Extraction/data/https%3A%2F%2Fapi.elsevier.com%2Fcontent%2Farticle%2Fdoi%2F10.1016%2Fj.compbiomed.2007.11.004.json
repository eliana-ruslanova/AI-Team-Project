This is mainly because the effectiveness of classification and detection systems have improved a great deal to help the medical experts in diagnosing. In this work, we investigate the use of principal component analysis (PCA), artificial immune system (AIS) and fuzzy \n                        k\n                     -NN to determine the normal and abnormal heart valves from the Doppler heart sounds. The proposed heart valve disorder detection system is composed of three stages. The first stage is the pre-processing stage. Filtering, normalization and white de-noising are the processes that were used in this stage. The feature extraction is the second stage. During feature extraction stage, wavelet packet decomposition was used. As a next step, wavelet entropy was considered as features. For reducing the complexity of the system, PCA was used for feature reduction. In the classification stage, AIS and fuzzy \n                        k\n                     -NN were used. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology, a comparative study is realized by using a data set containing 215 samples. The validation of the proposed method is measured by using the sensitivity and specificity parameters; 95.9% sensitivity and 96% specificity rate was obtained.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Doppler heart sounds"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Heart valves"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Wavelet packet decomposition"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Principal component analysis"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial immune system"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Fuzzy \n                        k\n                     -NN"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010482507001837", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482507001837", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "39549095316", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-39549095316", "pubmed-id": "18177849", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/39549095316", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20080104", "$": "2008-01-04"}}}}}
