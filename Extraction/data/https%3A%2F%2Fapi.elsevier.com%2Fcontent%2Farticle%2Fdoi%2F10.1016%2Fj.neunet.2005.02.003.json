First, for the Hamming maxnet, a generalized model is proposed, which covers under its umbrella most of the existing versions of the Hamming Maxnet. The network dynamics are time varying while the commonly used ramp function may be replaced by a much more general non-linear function. Also, the weight parameters of the network are time varying. A detailed convergence analysis is provided. A bound on the number of iterations required for convergence is derived and its distribution functions are given for the cases where the initial values of the nodes of the Hamming maxnet stem from the uniform and the peak distributions. Stabilization mechanisms aiming to prevent the node(s) with the maximum initial value diverging to infinity or decaying to zero are described. Simulations demonstrate the advantages of the proposed extension. Also, a rough comparison between the proposed generalized scheme as well as the original Hamming maxnet and its variants is carried out in terms of the time required for convergence, in hardware implementations. Finally, the other two parts of the Hamming network, namely the competitors generating module and the decoding module, are briefly considered in the framework of various applications such as classification/clustering, vector quantization and function optimization.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Non-linear hamming networks"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Mathematical and computational analysis"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hamming Maxnet"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "GEMNET"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "HITNET"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "SELECTRON"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Competitors generating module"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Decoding module"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Clustering"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Classification"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Quantization"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Function optimization"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608005000456", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608005000456", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "24344484393", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-24344484393", "pubmed-id": "15949918", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/24344484393", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20050608", "$": "2005-06-08"}}}}}
