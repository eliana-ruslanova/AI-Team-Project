Accurate recognition of control chart patterns is essential for efficient system monitoring to maintain high-quality products. This paper introduces a novel hybrid intelligent system that includes three main modules: a feature extraction module, a classifier module, and an optimization module. In the feature extraction module, a proper set combining the shape features and statistical features is proposed as the efficient characteristic of the patterns. In the classifier module, a multi-class support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier is proposed. For the optimization module, a particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to improve the generalization performance of the recognizer. In this module, it the SVM classifier design is optimized by searching for the best value of the parameters that tune its discriminant function (kernel parameter selection) and upstream by looking for the best subset of features that feed the classifier. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has very high recognition accuracy. This high efficiency is achieved with only little features, which have been selected using particle swarm optimizer.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Support vector machines"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Classification"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Feature selection"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Particle swarm optimization"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Control chart pattern recognition"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019057810000650", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019057810000650", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "77957910142", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-77957910142", "pubmed-id": "20663504", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77957910142", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20100720", "$": "2010-07-20"}}}}}
