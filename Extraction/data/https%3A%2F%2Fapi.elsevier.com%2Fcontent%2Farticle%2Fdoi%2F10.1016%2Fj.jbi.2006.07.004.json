Fig. 1 Overview of McSyBi. Fig. 2 Composite term weighting. A very simple fictive example where a two dimensional term vector (i.e., citation d i has only two terms, t i1 and t i2) is combined with one dimensional term vector m of MTST M. Fig. 3 Change of intra-cluster variances. The ratios were obtained by dividing an averaged intra-cluster variance by randomly generated clusters using the same citation set. The cluster sizes of the randomly generated ones were equal to those generated using McSyBi. For each of the conditions C1\u2013C4, all the citation sets were considered and the results were averaged. Smaller is better. Fig. 4 Effectiveness of using MeSH terms as cluster labels. The tf\u2217idf scores of MeSH terms were obtained by averaging those scores at ranks from top to the one specified in the figure over all the citation sets we used. Larger is better. Fig. 5 Effectiveness of using MTST in influencing clustering. The tf\u2217idf scores (weights) were obtained by averaging those scores of all the terms at (1) coordinates where the terms of a given MTST vector exist, and (2) the remainder, respectively. Both scores were obtained under two conditions where an MTST is used for changing clustering and nothing is used, respectively. For each of the conditions C1\u2013C4, all the citation sets were considered and the results were averaged. Larger is better for (1), and smaller is better for (2). Fig. 6 The result of the parallel voting or averaging buckshot (PVAB) algorithm applied to the FOXP2-gene-related papers, which is shown to a user. The labels were automatically selected from MeSH terms using their tf\u2217idf values. Small numbers correspond to PMIDs, which are sorted in chronological order of their publication. The ovals and the bold numbers (1 \u2013 4) were added by the author, and the numbers correspond to those clusters in Table 4. Fig. 7 Screen image of the non-hierarchical clustering of FOXP2. For each cluster, from the top, relevant terms (including relevant collocations and sentences that can be shown when a user clicks the highlight), relevant MeSH terms, MeSH terms at the second depth of the hierarchy that are the ancestors of the relevant MeSH terms, and the related UMLS Semantic Types are indicated. Each MeSH term has a link to the corresponding NCBI\u2019s MeSH database entry. The font size of a MeSH term reflects its relative relevance among those in the cluster. When a user moves the mouse cursor over a MeSH term, all the same MeSH terms in the other clusters, its ancestors, and the related UMLS Semantic Types are highlighted. In addition, for each cluster bar, there is a link to Cluster this cluster and a check box by which a user can cluster those citations in the specified cluster(s). Fig. 8 Generated dendrogram for FOXP2 (trimmed and no MTST is used). At each terminal (leaf) node, the serial number in the order of publication date and the article title with a link to the corresponding PubMed entry are at the top, then, the relevant terms delimited by vertical lines come next, and the relevant MeSH terms, each of which has a link setting the term as the one to influence the term weights, are at the bottom. At each non-terminal node where two children (i.e., either two leaves, two nodes, or a leaf and a node) are merged, the depth from the root that is clickable for a user to be able to expand or collapse its descendants, the similarity between the children, the relative similarity to its parent (parenthesized), and the relevant terms come first, and then, the relevant MeSH terms come next.

Abstract There is an urgent need for a system that facilitates surveys by biomedical researchers and the subsequent formulation of hypotheses based on the knowledge stored in literature. One approach is to cluster papers discussing a topic of interest and reveal its sub-topics that allow researchers to acquire an overview of the topic. We developed such a system called McSyBi. It accepts a set of citation data retrieved with PubMed and hierarchically and non-hierarchically clusters them based on the titles and the abstracts using statistical and natural language processing methods. A novel point is that McSyBi allows its users to change the clustering by entering a MeSH term or UMLS Semantic Type, and therefore they can see a set of citation data from multiple aspects. We evaluated McSyBi quantitatively and qualitatively: clustering of 27 sets of citation data (40643 different papers) and scrutiny of several resultant clusters. While non-hierarchical clustering provides us with an overview of the target topic, hierarchical clustering allows us to see more details and relationships among citation data. McSyBi is freely available at http://textlens.hgc.jp/McSyBi/. Keywords Clustering Text-mining Automatic labeling Summarization 1 Introduction While high-throughput biological research technologies such as microarrays allow biomedical researchers to obtain lots of data all at once [1\u20133], the researchers must conduct time-consuming surveys of the obtained data and the related information including genes, diseases, or molecular functions [4]. The availability of full genomic sequence data of many organisms such as Humans, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, etc. allows us to compare a gene of one organism with that of another in terms of functionality [5\u20139]. This requires an expert in an organism to survey biomedical knowledge of another organism. The development of the biomedical research field epitomized by them has been generating lots of research papers where essential biomedical knowledge is stored [10]. Efficiency and effectiveness in literature-related research activities in this domain have never been more important since researchers need to acquire biomedical knowledge from this vast amount of literature. Moreover, not only is searching for papers relevant to a topic important, but uncovering an unknown connection between the topic and other topics among the papers is also significant [11]. Consequently, fine retrieval of information is not enough, and we need a system that allows researchers to check biomedical research topics and clarify the relationships among them efficiently and effectively [4]. One approach is to show a user sub-topic-based clusters of papers discussing a topic given by the user, and provide a way to acquire an overview of them and find relationships among them. A research topic is often studied from several points of view (we use the term sub-topics for this meaning in this study) such as protein functions or genes\u2019 relationships to diseases [12], so grouping a set of papers according to these topics is useful for a researcher in learning a research topic. It is of particular significance when a literature search engine returns a long list of relevant papers. In the biomedical domain, the PubMed search engine 1 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=PubMed 1 is widely used for retrieving papers. It retrieves mainly 2 Some PubMed data are not stored in the MEDLINE database. (See more details at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/help/pmhelp.html#JournalSubsets.) 2 from the MEDLINE database (a literature database) that stores about 15 million citation data (consisting of all or some of the following elements: authors, titles, abstracts, etc., and we use the term citations hereafter) for free, and often returns a long list of them. Accordingly, there have been many efforts to organize retrieved results in this domain [13\u201318, etc]. Pratt et al. [13] developed a tool of this kind called DynaCat, which dynamically creates a hierarchical categorization of a search result corresponding to a user\u2019s query. It uses the query type to generate a query-sensitive organization of the search results. They focused on efficient organization of a search result to satisfy the user\u2019s information need. In other words, their purpose is to develop a fine question\u2013answering system that requires the user to previously have a rather clearer information need such as ways to prevent breast cancer. MedMiner [14] and ClusterMed 3 http://clustermed.info/ 3 proposed methods to organize a PubMed search result. MedMiner filters and optimizes a gene-related-query for a PubMed search by using GeneCards, 4 http://bioinfo.weizmann.ac.il/cards/index.shtml 4 a public gene database with a search engine. Then, it displays relevant citations by clustering them in several relevant terms specific to genetics such as upregulate or mutate. Since MedMiner does not provide hierarchical clusters, a cluster is big if there are many relevant citations in it. Moreover, it only focuses on genes. While the MedMiner is a free service, ClusterMed is a commercial service for clustering a PubMed search result. 5 Unregistered users can test a limited version below with 100 results. 5 It clusters retrieved citations by using several attributes of citations such as titles and abstracts, medical subject headings (MeSH) [19] terms, authors, and publication dates. The algorithm is not published but they say it does not use any background knowledge. 6 http://vivisimo.com/docs/howitworks.pdf 6 It does not allow us to influence clustering except for selecting some of the attributes mentioned above. In addition, Renner and Asz\u00f3di [15] studied hierarchical clustering methods to obtain protein annotation, and Iliopoulos et al. [16] proposed a non-hierarchical clustering approach to obtain sub-topics of the research of a protein. Shatkay et al., took a different approach for gene clustering by using a probabilistic method [17,18]. They developed a system that accepts a set of documents representing genes and outputs relationships among the genes along with descriptions of the relationships. They focused on finding themes instead of focusing on gene names or specific descriptions of gene functions to avoid suffering from synonymy and polysemy problems. However, those approaches do not allow users to influence clustering to reflect their interests once they issue a query. Moreover, (1) those systems focus on genes or proteins, and (2) users need to understand generated clusters through relevant terms appearing in documents in each cluster [14\u201318]. Our goal is to provide a researcher with a comprehensive overview of a research topic and relationships among sub-topics to facilitate biomedical knowledge acquisition and hypotheses generation based on the biomedical papers. In other words, we are aiming at developing a system that automatically generates a review. The main points of our approach are as follows, which partly share basic motivations with Iliopoulos et al. [16] and Cutting et al. [20]. 1. The assumed user\u2019s information need is a brief and comprehensive summary of a research topic. This means that all the citations retrieved with a PubMed search could be relevant. In other words, users do not have a specific information need concerning the topic. What they want is not a system to narrow down lots of citations, but a system to structure them. For example, if a microarray experiment indicates that FOXP2 gene expression is related to a gene of interest, and the researcher does not know very much about the gene well, he/she needs to learn about it: already conducted studies, known or unknown facts, etc. In this situation, all the papers discussing FOXP2 could be relevant. 2. Our approach allows users to influence clustering after browsing the initial clusters for them to be able to see one topic from multiple aspects. After briefly learning a topic, users can change the clusters by entering a MeSH term or a Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) [21] Semantic Type (ST) into the system. It may provide another aspect of the research topic. The advantage of re-clustering over iterating PubMed searches using a more specific query is that it avoids dropping potentially relevant citations retrieved in the first search. For example, after knowing that FOXP2 is related to autism, to see the retrieved citations from another aspect such as disease or syndrome, he/she might want to re-cluster it in terms of it. We chose MeSH terms and UMLS STs or MTSTs as media for conveying a user\u2019s interest since they are controlled vocabularies having a conceptually hierarchical structure in biomedicine, and therefore users can choose a suitable term by traversing the hierarchy. Every MeSH term is mapped to at least one UMLS ST, and therefore if a MeSH term is assigned to a citation, we can say a UMLS ST is also assigned to it. 3. Each cluster is automatically labeled by relevant MeSH terms as well as relevant terms including collocations. Since it was often difficult for us to catch cruxes of a cluster only by seeing relevant terms due to their granularity and diversity, we developed this method. For the same reason as the previous point, MeSH terms can be good indicators for representing the contents of a cluster combined with related terms. The second point is novel, and, to our knowledge, this approach for biomedicine has never been implemented. The third point has been implemented by ClusterMed, but its method is unknown. We believe a system having these features is significantly required where research fields are highly divergent and integration of them is needed [11]. Therefore, we have developed a system called McSyBi (Multi-Document Clustering System for Biomedicine). Our hypotheses are that clustering with MeSH term labeling makes browsing and overviewing of a vast amount of biomedical data more efficient, and term weight modification by using MTSTs enables us to see the data from multiple aspects effectively. It accepts a set of citations retrieved with a PubMed search and clusters the data based on the titles and the abstracts using statistical and natural language processing (NLP) methods. McSyBi generates hierarchical and non-hierarchical clusters. It allows its user to change the clustering by entering an MTST into the system. Influencing clustering by an MTST is done by using term distributions in titles and abstracts for each MTST: term frequencies of the citations to which an MTST is assigned and those to which it is not assigned. Accordingly, McSyBi can cluster no MeSH-term-assigned citations even if a user issues an MTST to McSyBi to change clustering. To test the hypotheses, we let McSyBi cluster 27 sets of citations (40643 papers) on several biomedical topics. We quantitatively evaluated the effectiveness of the clustering, the use of MeSH terms for labeling of clusters, and the use of MTSTs for influencing clustering. In addition, we conducted qualitative evaluations: comparison of clusters generated by McSyBi with those by Iliopoulos et al. (TEXTQUEST) [16] and a case study of using McSyBi. 2 Approach An overview of the system is shown in Fig. 1 . A series of processes of McSyBi begins when a user issues a query. We describe each process briefly in the following sections. 2.1 Citations retrieval McSyBi forwards a query submitted by a user to PubMed and retrieves the citations relevant to the query. This means that if there are citations relevant to a query but not retrieved by PubMed, McSyBi cannot process them. We focused on clustering given data and providing an overview of a topic, and therefore improving recall of retrieving query-related citations is not the scope of this study. Among retrieved citations, the system uses their titles, abstracts, publication dates, and MeSH terms for further processing. Titles and abstracts are combined and processed equally, so we collectively call them abstracts hereafter, and retrieved abstracts are tokenized at first. To retrieve only citations that have an abstract and exclude review papers, McSyBi adds the option hasabstract and NOT review[pt] to every query for the PubMed searches. Review papers are not our focus at this time since they have an overview of a research topic, and therefore such a paper could cover many sub-topics. In addition, to avoid retrieving retracted publications, McSyBi adds the option NOT retracted publication[pt], too. 2.2 Using lexical and syntactic information McSyBi uses a stopwords list to eliminate non-relevant terms such as of and the. We adopted those words used in PubMed 7 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bookres.fcgi/helppubmed/pubmedhelp.pdf 7 and added some wh-words (whether, where, who, why) and cardinal numbers from one to ten after surveying several clustering results. We also crafted several regular expressions to eliminate non-relevant terms. The reason is that there are not only words indicating units such as mol, Dalton, min, etc., but also their combined ones such as Da/mol or mg/sec. We did not make a large stopwords list because some terms that are apparently non-relevant might be relevant to some users. In addition, we devised a feature for users to be able to add a stopword. Another way of eliminating non-relevant terms we took is removing frequently and seldom appearing terms [22]. This removal reduces the total number of terms to be processed for clustering and therefore makes the process time faster. At the same time, however, it may drop relevant but relatively less appearing terms. After surveying several conditions, we determined to remove terms appearing more than 80 or less than 1% of given citations. 8 McSyBi considers every term for sets having less than 50 citations. 8 As for collocations, those appearing more than 80 or less than a third percent of given citations are removed. Since there are lots of technical terms in biomedical papers, we used UMLS to stem the text to absorb several morphological variants. It has dictionaries that allow us to map several morphological forms to the root forms such as SNPs to SNP or phosphorylation to phosphorylate. Moreover, we used abbreviation\u2013expansion (AE) matching to partially address synonymy and polysemy issues [4,23] using a tool that extracts pairs of abbreviations and their expansions [24]. McSyBi maps each abbreviation to its expansion for each abstract. The assumption was that if an author did not use polysemous abbreviations within a single paper with multiple meanings, by expanding abbreviations beforehand our system could avoid taking same abbreviations with different meanings as identical. Moreover, this approach can be a solution to some synonymy problems; some authors use a different abbreviation from others to represent the same concept. For example, some authors use ACP for alcoholic chronic pancreatitis while others use alcoholic CP; there is no common word between the two abbreviations. We currently do not take another approach to the synonymy issue such as that of gene or protein names, as our focus is not to extract and identify all the synonyms in abstracts. In addition, McSyBi identifies a collocation as a single term since appropriately managing a collocation helps to capture concepts in abstracts [25]. A collocation denotes a subset of noun phrases that consist of multiple words and is defined as follows: one or more consecutive adjective(s) or premodifier(s) of a nominal followed by a noun or a nominal head. Taking tumor suppressor protein as an example, tumor and suppressor are the premodifiers and protein is the nominal head. Part-of-speech and syntactic annotation was carried out using FDG Lite [26]. 2.3 Term weighting and re-weighting After the syntactic and lexical processes, McSyBi weighs each term based on its appearance distribution over the given set of abstracts. We adopted the vector space model [22] and used two sets of term vectors to obtain similarities among abstracts: those of retrieved abstracts and of MTSTs. The former is generated on the fly and the latter is prepared beforehand to be used for influencing clustering. 2.3.1 TF\u2217IDF We chose the term frequency and inverse document frequency (tf\u2217idf) weighting scheme [27], which can be calculated as follows: (1) weight ( i , j ) = ( 1 + log ( tf i , j ) ) log N df i if tf i , j > 1 , 0 if tf i , j = 1 , where tf i,j denotes the number of term i occurring in abstract j, and df j denotes the number of abstracts that contain term i in the set of retrieved abstracts. N denotes the total number of retrieved abstracts. As for the term weighting scheme for the term vectors of MTSTs, tf i,j denotes the number of abstract i occurring in the set of abstracts that have MTST j, df j denotes the number of MTSTs that contain abstract i, and N denotes the total number of the MTSTs. Depending on the type of a target term (i.e., MeSH term or UMLS ST), df j and N are respectively obtained based on either the MeSH term set or the UMLS ST set. All the term vectors are normalized. 2.3.2 Composite term weighting When a user gives an MTST to influence clustering, the two sets of the term vectors are linearly combined. Let d i and m be the term vectors of citation i and given MTST M, respectively. Then the former can be represented using two term vectors d i,m and d i,p as follows: d i = d i,m + d i,p , where d i,m is the portion in the subspace corresponding to the vector space of m, and d i,p is the remainder. In this situation, combined term vector d i \u2032 is represented as follows: (2) d i \u2032 = d i , m \u2032 + \u03b1 d i , p , (3) d i , m \u2032 = \u03b1 \u03b3 d i , m + \u03b2 ( 1 - \u03b3 ) m . The factors \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 are real numbers and 0\u2a7d \u03b3 \u2a7d1. Fig. 2 illustrates how the term vector of a citation is combined with that of a MeSH term. This combination is based on the Ide-Regular term re-weighting method developed for relevance-feedback in Information Retrieval (IR) [28]. We call this calculation scheme composite term weighting. Since some terms of a retrieved abstract are not in the term vector of an MTST, and to reflect those terms on the clustering, this term weighting distinguishes them ( d i,p ) from the others ( d i,m ). An advantage of using this weighting method is that it can utilize the usefulness of MTSTs even for citations to which no MeSH terms are assigned since the term vectors for each MTST are prepared beforehand. 2.4 Dimension reduction Before McSyBi conducts any clustering, all the input term vectors are transformed using Singular Value Decomposition 9 We used SVDPACK C version [29] (http://www.netlib.org/svdpack/) with some modifications to obtain principal components. 9 [30,31] (SVD) to reduce the dimensionality and partially solve the synonymy problem [32]. This is called latent semantic indexing model [31] in IR and its main idea is to map each document and query vector into a lower dimensional space that is associated with concepts. In this model, a term-citation association matrix D (D =[ d 1, d 2,\u2026, d N ], where N denotes citation frequency) can be decomposed to: (4) D = U \u03a3 V T , where U denotes m \u00d7 m (m is the number of the dimensions of term vectors) orthogonal matrix consisting of eigenvectors derived from DD T , and V denotes N \u00d7 N orthogonal matrix consisting of eigenvectors derived from D T D. \u03a3 is an r \u00d7 r diagonal matrix of singular values where r =min(m,N) is the rank of D. When only taking the k largest singular values of \u03a3 with their corresponding columns in U and V T , we can obtain D k whose rank is k, which is closest to the original matrix D in the least square sense. D k is defined as follows: (5) D k = U k \u03a3 k V k T , where k is the number of the dimensions of a reduced concept space. Note that V is equal to the eigenvectors obtaining by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and we used them to plot a result of non-hierarchical clustering after normalization ( \u2211 i = 1 N v ij = 0 for jth eigenvector v j , V =[ v 1, v 2,\u2026, v m ]). 2.5 Clustering 2.5.1 Hierarchical clustering We used group-average agglomerative clustering with the cosine measure as its similarity measure [27]. This algorithm generates hierarchical clusters efficiently; its time complexity is O (N 2), where N denotes the number of citations to be clustered. The cosine measure is defined as follows: (6) cos ( x \u2192 , y \u2192 ) = \u2211 i = 1 n x i y i \u2211 i = 1 n x i 2 \u2211 i = 1 n y i 2 , where x \u2192 and y \u2192 are n-dimensional vectors in a real-valued space. In our study, x \u2192 and y \u2192 are term vectors of abstracts. The obtained clusters are displayed as a dendrogram where each leaf (terminal node) corresponds to a citation. At each terminal node, its serial number, PubMed ID, relevant terms including collocations (i.e., terms with the five highest weights), and the MeSH terms (major heads only, if any) are displayed. The serial numbers are in chronological order of the publication dates, and each PubMed ID has a link to PubMed. At each non-terminal node where its two children are merged (i.e., a cluster is generated), the similarity between the children, the relative similarity to the parent, and the relevant terms and MeSH terms are displayed. We call those relevant terms and MeSH terms cluster labels, and labels for non-hierarchical clustering are also obtained in the same manner. Relevant MeSH terms are ordered in the relevant scores that are calculated as: (7) score ( m ) = | C m | \u00b7 log M | C m | ( C m = { c i | m \u2208 c i , 1 \u2a7d i \u2a7d M } ) , where M is the number of clusters at the merger, C m is the set of clusters that have MeSH term m, and c i is the ith cluster of the set. |C m | is the number of clusters in set C m . This score is based on the tf\u2217idf score and that of a MeSH term is higher if (1) the MeSH term is in fewer clusters and (2) more sub-clusters in a cluster have it. It puts more emphasis on the latter factor than the former. 2.5.2 Non-hierarchical clustering We developed a clustering method called parallel voting or average buckshot (PVAB) method based on [20,33,34] to obtain non-hierarchical clusters of a citation set. This method basically uses majority voting to determine cluster centroids for the k-means algorithm by conducting i processes of buckshot algorithm [20] in parallel. We took this approach based on our preliminary survey that, although results of the buckshot algorithm were very susceptible to the initial centroids positions, resultant clusters often fell into a fixed number of cluster patterns. Nevertheless, there were some cases where the sets of resultant clusters were all different. Accordingly, to obtain the final centroids, McSyBi averages over resultant centroids by applying k-means clustering to those centroids if such a case happens. The buckshot algorithm is a framework of a clustering procedure that makes clustering more efficient by combining hierarchical and non-hierarchical (flat partition) clustering algorithms. First, the algorithm conducts hierarchical agglomerative clustering from randomly taken KN samples where K and N denote the number of clusters and the total number of samples, respectively. Then, it conducts non-hierarchical clustering by using the previous result as its initial centers. It is assumed that hierarchical agglomerative clustering takes quadratic time O ( KN 2 ) , and non-hierarchical clustering takes linear time O(KN). Therefore, the total time order is O (2KN)= O (KN). In our case, McSyBi randomly takes KN citations and clusters them hierarchically with the group-average agglomerative clustering. Then, it clusters all the citations with k-means clustering in O (KN) time whose initial cluster centroids are those obtained from the preceding clustering. Cluster labels are also generated in the same manner as the hierarchical clustering. McSyBi displays a clustering result in two ways. One is to show the labels (i.e., relevant terms including collocations and MeSH terms) and the relationships to UMLS STs for each cluster. Each MeSH term has a link to the corresponding NCBI\u2019s MeSH database entry. Moreover, users can choose one or multiple resultant clusters to be clustered next. The other is to display a result on an X\u2013Y plane on which each citation is plotted and colored according to the cluster it belongs to. This is to provide a visual clustering result to users. As mentioned above, their coordinates are obtained with PCA from their term vectors at the same time when McSyBi conducts SVD, and the x and y axes are the first and the second principal components, respectively. 2.6 Evaluation We evaluated McSyBi quantitatively and qualitatively; statistical evaluations and comparisons with previously published results as well as a case study. The quantitative evaluations were done by letting McSyBi cluster 27 sets of citations or 40,643 different papers on human genes/proteins, diseases, a species, and a related concept. To assess the effects of (1) the UMLS and AE and (2) the term screening (i.e., removing frequently and seldom appearing terms), we prepared four experimental conditions, that is, the two by two combinations of those factors\u2019 presence or absence. As for the former condition, when using neither UMLS nor AE, we used Porter stemmer [35], a well known term stemming algorithm. We call each condition as follows, C1: using UMLS and AE, not term screening, C2: using UMLS, AE, and term screening, C3: using Porter stemmer, not term screening, and C4: using Porter stemmer and term screening. We evaluated the results in the following aspects: browsing efficiency (we call this evaluation E1), effectiveness of using MeSH terms as cluster labels (E2), effectiveness of using MTSTs to influence clustering (E3), and consistency between hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering (E4). An evaluation method to test our hypotheses was to see differences of intra-cluster variances between clusters generated by McSyBi (McSyBi clusters) and those generated randomly (E1). Note that the sizes of clusters to be compared were the same. Our assumption is that, if those values of McSyBi clusters are smaller than those of randomly generated ones, each resultant McSyBi cluster represents a sub-topic, and therefore efficiency of the browse is improved. Intra-cluster variance J e is obtained for each cluster set D i using a sum-of-squared-error criterion [36], where the distances of every citation pair in a cluster are averaged as follows: (8) J e = 1 2 \u2211 i = 1 c n i s i \u00af , (9) s i \u00af = 1 n i 2 \u2211 x \u2208 D i \u2211 x \u2032 \u2208 D i s ( x , x \u2032 ) , where c and n i are the number of clusters and the number of term vectors in a cluster D i , respectively. The similarity function s( x , x \u2032) is the cosine measure in this study. In addition, we took the MTSTs genetics, metabolism, Mutation, and Disease or Syndrome as examples to see the influences of MTSTs given by users on clustering. They have different frequencies and distributions among the citations. The terms genetics, metabolism, and the children of Disease or Syndrome were often assigned to the citations we used but not equally distributed (the ratios of their frequencies to the numbers of MeSH-term-assigned citations were 0.36, 0.30, and 0.37, respectively), and Mutation was assigned to relatively few of the citations (0.093). We used these MTSTs for other evaluations as well. Concerning the effectiveness of using MeSH terms as cluster labels, we evaluated the tf\u2217idf scores of those MeSH terms. In particular, we averaged the top r tf\u2217idf scores for each cluster (1\u2a7d r \u2a7d10), and calculated the ratio of an averaged score obtained from the clusters generated by McSyBi to that generated randomly (E2). Our assumption is that, if MeSH terms are effective for labeling each cluster, the ratios are constantly higher than one. Let the j-th tf\u2217idf value of a MeSH term in a cluster i be tf\u2217idf(m ij ). Then the measure to be used for E2 S l is defined as: (10) S l = 1 cr \u2211 i = 1 c \u2211 j = 1 r tf \u2217 idf ( m ij ) , where c is the number of clusters. As for confirming the effectiveness of MTSTs in changing clustering, we evaluated the differences of the averaged term weights for each term vector between term vectors generated using an MTST and those generated without any MTSTs in terms of the MTST (E3). We compared a weight obtained by averaging ones at those coordinates where the term vector of a given MTST exists with that obtained by averaging the remainder. The former is to be larger than the latter in the case where the MTST is used for influencing the term vector. The reason is that we use the cosine measure as the similarity measure, and therefore those terms having higher weights make more contributions to the similarity. To be precise, let m and d i be the term vectors of MTST M and citation i, respectively. Then they are represented as follows: (11) m = ( m 1 , m 2 , \u2026 , m k ) , d i = ( d i 1 , d i 2 , \u2026 , d ik , d ik + 1 , \u2026 , d in ) , where k (1\u2a7d k) and n(k \u2a7d n) are the numbers of dimensions of m and d i , respectively. In this situation, we compare averaged weights w a \u00af = 1 / N \u2211 i = 1 N w ia with w ib \u00af = 1 / N \u2211 i = 1 N w ib under two conditions where an MTST is used for changing clustering and nothing is used, respectively, where N is the number of citations. Those weights are defined as follows: (12) w ia = 1 k \u2211 j = 1 k tf \u2217 idf ( d ij ) , w ib = 1 n - k \u2211 j = k + 1 n tf \u2217 idf ( d ij ) . In addition, if there are a small number of terms influenced by an MTST, its effectiveness would be limited. Accordingly, we also obtained the averaged log ratio of the number of the influenced terms to that of the remainders for each citation set under each MTST. Concerning the difference between hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering, we evaluated the consistency between them both generated under the same condition (E4). If it is higher enough, using non-hierarchical one firstly and hierarchical one later makes sense to see more details of a cluster. Note that the number of clusters for non-hierarchical clustering was determined by comparing several results with different numbers, and we took four throughout the evaluation to enable formal comparisons among the different citation sets. We conducted qualitative evaluations in the following two ways: comparing results of McSyBi with previously published results by Iliopoulos et al. (TEXTQUEST) [16] and a case study in our laboratory. The former evaluation was done by obtaining the data set referred to in their paper. 10 We obtained the data from http://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/cgg/mining/textquest/. 10 While the results of TEXTQUEST include those citations that do not contain abstracts, those of McSyBi do not. There were two data sets discussed in the paper, and we were able to download them. We used K-sets 11 A K-set contains citations in the MEDLINE format. 11 to obtain citations for clustering. The latter evaluation was done by issuing queries in which we are interested to McSyBi and let it cluster the related citations. Then, we scrutinized the generated clusters. 3 Results 3.1 Quantitative evaluations To test our hypotheses, we let McSyBi cluster 27 sets of citations (Table 1 ). Eliminating frequently and seldom appearing terms reduces the number of terms to be processed about two fifths (60.9%) and 70% (68.4%) for C2 and C4 on average, respectively. First, we obtained differences of intra-cluster variances (Fig. 3 ). For all the resultant cluster sets, the variances of McSyBi clusters on all the four conditions were about a quarter on average (0.23). Concerning the effectiveness of using MeSH terms as cluster labels, the averaged r highest tf\u2217idf scores (1\u2a7d r \u2a7d10) of the MeSH terms used as the labels of clusters generated by McSyBi were about one and a third (1.34, 1.37, 1.28, and 1.29 for each of the conditions C1 to C4, respectively) times higher than those in the randomly generated clusters across the entire citation sets (Fig. 4 ). As for the effectiveness of using MTSTs in influencing clustering, the averaged term weights w a \u00af and w b \u00af of each citation set for the four MTSTs were about from 0.044 (C3) to 0.070 (C2) and from 0.043 (C2) to 0.060 (C3) on average, respectively when no MTST was used. When the four MTSTs were used for changing weights, every w a \u00af became higher (from 0.076 (C3) to 0.10 (C2) on average) and every w b \u00af became lower (from 0.0085 (C4) to 0.014 (C1) on average). Fig. 5 shows the result. Regarding the log ratios, those of all the four MTSTs were more than zero on average (from 0.202 to 0.536, 0.445 to 1.01, \u22120.696 to 1.61, and \u22120.475 to 1.54 for each of the conditions C1 to C4, respectively). There are more cases where the log ratios were below zero when we used Porter stemmer. Concerning C2, everything was more than zero. Lastly, concerning the consistency between hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering, for each of the conditions C1 to C4, 88.3 (SD =5.89), 87.3 (6.57), 87.7 (7.40), and 88.0 (5.86)% of the clusters shared the same citations between them when we took the tree depth of three for the hierarchical clusters. 3.2 Qualitative evaluations Considering the quantitative evaluations and our preliminary survey of quality, the condition C2 showed the best performance on the whole, and we determined to use it for the qualitative evaluations. First, we compared resultant clusters generated by McSyBi with those by TEXTQUEST. Tables 2 and 3 show the clustering results of McSyBi using the data sets of Examples 1 and 2 in their paper, respectively. The numbers of the clusters were the same as those mentioned in the paper. Table 2 shows the two clusters whose most relevant MeSH terms are Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively. Indeed, the citations were obtained by combining two independent literature retrievals using the queries escherichia AND pili and cerevisiae AND cdc\u2217, and the result appropriately reflected the feature as TEXTQUEST did. Although some terms such as vaccine or restrictive are apparently non-relevant to the cluster, other relevant terms and the MeSH terms such as Fimbriae, Bacterial or Cell Cycle Proteins are helpful to catch the brief contents of the cluster. Table 3 shows the three clusters that reflect developmental stages of Drosophila melanogaster. In this clustering, the citations were also obtained by combining two independently retrieved ones with the queries of anterior\u2013posterior AND drosophila and dorsal\u2013ventral AND drosophila. Of the three clusters generated by McSyBi, the second cluster corresponds to one discussed in the paper, whose most relevant MeSH term is Oogenesis although citations unrelated to the three main topics are in the first cluster in the case of our clustering (this is discussed later). This cluster contains citations related to the early developmental stage of the animal. The other two clusters are slightly different from those in the paper. We reviewed the result based on Alberts et al. [37, chapters 15 and 21]. Our first cluster contains citations related to the basic segment patterning, whose relevant terms include antennapedia, hunchback, and homeotic. In addition, the relevant collocations are homeotic gene, segmentation gene, gap gene, etc., and the relevant MeSH terms are DNA-Binding Proteins, Transforming Growth Factor beta, etc. Our third cluster contains citations related to the patterning of appendages, which shows a contrasting difference from their cluster composed of citations related to the embryonic dorsoventral axis specification. The relevant terms are wing, boundary, and apterous as well as compartment boundary, wing imaginal disc, dorsal ventral boundary, etc. The relevant MeSH terms are Wing, Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental, etc. Next, we introduce a case study of using McSyBi concerning FOXP2 or forkhead box P2, a human gene that encodes an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor expressed in fetal and adult brains [38]. It is located on 7q31 and contains a forkhead DNA binding domain, a leucine zipper, a zinc finger, and a polyglutamine tract [39,40]. Although a point mutation in FOXP2 has been associated with developmental verbal dyspraxia, no association with another speech disorder, autism, has been found [38]. Some researchers study the gene in terms of the protein evolution by comparing humans with other species such as chimpanzees or mice [41,42], or in terms of vocal learning capability in comparison with songbirds [43]. McSyBi clustered the citations into four categories, and Fig. 6 and Table 4 show the result. Fig. 7 shows a screen shot of the result. Also, Fig. 8 shows a screen shot of the generated dendrogram. After learning that the FOXP2 gene might be related to autism, we gave McSyBi the MeSH term Autistic Disorder ({\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3}={1,1,0}). Again, we obtained the cluster of autistic disorder, but there was a difference in the terms displayed at each leaf node of the dendrogram (Table 5 ). Interestingly, there was no single term that appears in both. For example, the term mutate in the clusters with the MeSH term was not in the initial clusters, and it is a relevant term in the studies of relationships between the gene and the disease since segregation of an affected family from the others by mutation reveals an evidence of the relationship. Table 6 shows the non-hierarchical clustering result, and it also shows the difference from the initial clusters in that there are relevant MeSH terms related to mutations such as Mutation, Mutation, Missense, and Polymorphism, Genetic that are not at first. In addition, after we learned that FOXP2 is one of the genes that might be related to autism, we issued another query about autism to the system (Table 1) to survey autism studies. The number of retrieved citations was 3472, and one of the generated clusters grouped a set of abstracts discussing the association of autism with the Measles Mumps Rubella (MMR) vaccine (Table 7 ). 4 Discussion 4.1 Focus Our main focus is not to find relationships among genes obtained by microarray analyses based on related papers [17,44,32, etc.] nor develop an IR system in biomedicine, but to provide researchers with an overview of a research topic to facilitate their surveys of it and make hypotheses based on millions of papers. The result of E1 shows its effectiveness in providing efficient browsing of literature-based biomedical data. There have been lots of studies of literature-based hypothesis making or literature-based discovery [45\u201348, etc], but they do not necessarily focus on providing an overview. For example, it was difficult to obtain the similar result as McSyBi provided when we used BITOLA [46] in the case of FOXP2\u2014autism\u2014MMR vaccine since it did not generate clusters, and there were lots of candidates listed up. 12 Measles Mumps Rubella vaccine was at the 113th rank of the 4354 concept names listed by BITOLA. 12 We believe that an efficient and effective knowledge navigation tool provides a better way of making a hypothesis and finding an unknown biologically meaningful relationship. 4.2 MeSH term usage McSyBi accepts an MTST as a user\u2019s interest and changes term weights according to the background knowledge of term distributions in abstracts for each MTST. This way of using MTSTs, especially MeSH terms, is based on the following discussion. MeSH terms are useful for a computer to extract brief contents of the paper without using complicated NLP techniques. Struble and Dharmanolla [49] showed the usefulness by comparing clustering of MEDLINE citations based on MeSH terms with full-text based clustering. However, regarding our approach, all or some of the following problems arise when we use MeSH terms for clustering. First, there are some MEDLINE citations to which no MeSH term is assigned for several reasons [50]. One reason is that some citations for which PubMed searches are not in the MEDLINE database, and they do not have MeSH terms. Furthermore, since MeSH terms are assigned manually, some citations are waiting to be assigned. Second, the MeSH vocabulary is updated annually, so some citations did not have appropriate MeSH terms that had not been included in the vocabulary at the time of their publication. For example, a MeSH term MAP Kinase Signaling System was introduced in 2000, so citations before its introduction do not have it even if they discuss MAP kinase signaling. Third, the granularity of the MeSH vocabulary is too coarse for some topics. For example, papers on FOX family genes do not have those MeSH terms describing them while the gene p53 does (Genes, p53). Consequently, two kinds of papers discussing Foxp2 and Foxp4 genes respectively that have the same MeSH terms cannot be distinguished from each other if we only use them for clustering. Nevertheless, MeSH terms are useful in that term distributions in abstracts for each MeSH term and UMLS ST can be used for term weighting, and we used them as media for conveying a user\u2019s interest. The result of E3 shows its effectiveness. The importance is that using an MTST for clustering enables us to see another aspect of citations to which that MTST is not assigned as we show in the case of FOXP2. The MeSH term Autistic Disorder strengthened the weights of terms related to mutation, and therefore the citations were clustered in terms of them. Although this result might be not useful for users who want to retrieve citations related to autism only, as mentioned above, our focus includes revealing meaningful relationships among obtained citations and multiple aspects of them. In the FOXP2 case, the re-clustering revealed that several studies were related to each other in terms of mutation despite the diversity of the sub-topics. In addition to this effectiveness, MeSH terms are also effective when used as labels for clusters along with extracted terms, since extracted terms are often too narrow or specific to acquire a brief content of a paper. Since MeSH is used to index the MEDLINE database [50] and the result of E2 indicates, our application is reasonable. However, the variances are large (Table 8 ), and we need more thorough analyses whether we can improve stability of the effectiveness. 4.3 Comparison Concerning the comparison of McSyBi with TEXTQUEST, the generated clusters of the Example 1 data set were very similar to those by TEXTQUEST. The advantage of McSyBi is the appropriate relevant MeSH terms. As for the Example 2 data set, while one of our clusters represents the patterning of appendages, there is no such cluster in the TEXTQUEST clusters. Instead, our first cluster contains many citations in their first and second clusters judging from the relevant terms such as hunchback, gastrulate, and rel. It is due to the difference of the citations to be used for clustering as well as the difference of the methods. Since there is not any standard reference set nor measure such as recall and precision currently, it is difficult to compare more objectively, and we need such resources and measures. Regarding the relevant MeSH terms, they are relatively vague in some clusters because (1) there are diverse citations in a cluster, or (2) there is no appropriate MeSH terms. In the cluster of the segment patterning, the relevant MeSH terms are coarse to describe the contents although they are not erroneous. For example, products of homeotic selector genes are DNA binding proteins. This is the case of (1) since there are citations unrelated to any of the main themes of the three clusters in addition to those related to the segment patterning. When setting the number of clusters to four, we obtained the fourth cluster composed of those unrelated citations; the labels of the other three clusters basically followed the case of the three clusters, and those of the segment patterning cluster included a more appropriate one Genes, Homeobox (Table 9 ). In the cluster of the patterning of appendages, the relevant MeSH terms such as Wing and Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental are more appropriate than those of the segment patterning, but they are still relatively vague; there is no more specific MeSH term than Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental. It would be helpful if there is a MeSH term describing the appendage development, and this is the case of (2). Alternatively, we can also think of providing sentences that contain relevant terms. This can help a user to catch contexts where the relevant terms are used. When we added this feature, 13 The relevance of a sentence is calculated based on the tf\u2217idf scores of the terms in it. The listing order of the extracted sentences follows their location in the abstracts, that is, those of titles are at the first. 13 those extracted for the cluster of the appendage development includes the following sentence: Organization of wing formation and induction of a wing-patterning gene at the dorsal/ventral compartment boundary. (PMID: 8127364) This would be informative to catch the characteristics of the cluster. We will study sentence extraction and summarization methods next. 4.4 Clustering In our study, we developed a way for users to enter their interests into the clustering system to acquire an overview of the retrieved papers. Our solution is to provide both hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering methods. Comparing them, the former provides more detailed relationships among retrieved citations than the latter because of the nature of its algorithm. However, obtaining hierarchical clusters needs more processing time (O (N 2)) than obtaining non-hierarchical ones (O (KN)). Therefore, an appropriate way is to obtain non-hierarchical clusters first and then select one of them and obtain hierarchical clusters of that cluster to see more details of it. The result of E4 supports this approach. Although our study showed the feasibility of our method that can be used for efficient and effective knowledge navigation based on biomedical papers, it is far from ideal. First, there are some clustering issues. Currently, our system does not provide a cluster having more than one parent. Since the structure of generated clusters depends on the order of the data to be clustered when group-average agglomerative hierarchical clustering is used [51], we need to consider them. Similarly, McSyBi clustering results are susceptible to randomly generated initial conditions due to the nature of the k-means algorithm although our method alleviates their effects by averaging or voting over multiple results of the buckshot algorithm. A way of compensating this issue is to iteratively cluster a retrieved citation set and obtain multiple clustering results. In addition, although the average inconsistency between hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering was relatively small (12.7%), four of the citation sets had more than 20% inconsistency. This partially depends on MTSTs used for clustering; using an MTST makes the consistency of a given data increase while that of another data decrease. For example, the former case happened for QID 11 and the latter did for QID 12 when we took Disease or Syndrome as the MTST. We believe this result supports the usefulness of seeing a same data from multiple aspects. Still, we need thorough investigations along with preparing a reference set. Second, nested terms are not handled well. For example, one of the clusters of FOXP2-related citations has the following relevant terms: forkhead domain, forkhead transcription, and forkhead. In this case, the one word term forkhead is inappropriate as a relevant one. This issue also causes a needless increase in term vector dimensionality. C-value [52] could be a choice to improve. Note that this issue does not have any relationship to MeSH term handling. Third, McSyBi needs time for its whole process to obtain hierarchical clustering. This issue becomes especially significant when the number of retrieved data is huge (obtaining hierarchical clustering of over 5000 citations takes very long time currently). Since one of the purposes of developing McSyBi is to unveil unpublished relationships between multiple independently retrieved sets of citations, it is imperative to improve the efficiency of the whole process to make McSyBi more scalable. As mentioned above, this issue is alleviated by taking the approach of using non-hierarchical clustering first, since this clustering takes much less time even for over 5000 citations (a few minutes). We are continuing to work on developing a method that can cluster a larger set of citations more efficiently. Finally, this issue is not about the method itself, but about evaluations. We need a user-centric test to gain more credibility of McSyBi\u2019s usefulness. As mentioned above, there is not any standard reference set nor measure to evaluate systems like McSyBi currently. Relating to this issue, it is also difficult to develop a method of determining the optimal numbers of clusters for a non-hierarchical clustering algorithm to generate for a citation set. 5 Conclusion We introduce a novel citation clustering system called McSyBi that generates hierarchical and non-hierarchical clusters. Each generated cluster is automatically labeled by both relevant MeSH terms and extracted terms including collocations. Users can reflect their interests on clustering by entering MTSTs and learn multiple aspects of a research topic. Non-hierarchical clusters are useful in capturing an overview of the retrieved citations while hierarchical clusters are useful in obtaining more detailed relationships among them. Our approach can be a great help where research fields are highly divergent and integration of them is needed. Employing soft clustering, appropriate handling of nested collocations, reducing processing time, and conducting a user-centric test are things for us to do in the next step.

One approach is to cluster papers discussing a topic of interest and reveal its sub-topics that allow researchers to acquire an overview of the topic. We developed such a system called McSyBi. It accepts a set of citation data retrieved with PubMed and hierarchically and non-hierarchically clusters them based on the titles and the abstracts using statistical and natural language processing methods. A novel point is that McSyBi allows its users to change the clustering by entering a MeSH term or UMLS Semantic Type, and therefore they can see a set of citation data from multiple aspects. We evaluated McSyBi quantitatively and qualitatively: clustering of 27 sets of citation data (40643 different papers) and scrutiny of several resultant clusters.
