The motivation is to utilize the feature-wise degree of belonging of patterns to all classes that are obtained through a fuzzification process. A fuzzification process generates a membership matrix having total number of elements equal to the product of the number of features and classes present in the data set. These matrix elements are the input to neural networks. The effectiveness of the proposed model is established with four benchmark data sets (completely labeled) and two remote sensing images (partially labeled). Different performance measures such as misclassification, classification accuracy and kappa index of agreement for completely labeled data sets, and \n                        \u03b2\n                      index of homogeneity and Davies\u2013Bouldin (DB) index of compactness for remotely sensed images are used for quantitative analysis of results. All these measures supported the superiority of the proposed NF classification model. The proposed model learns well even with a lower percentage of training data that makes the system fast.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Pattern classification"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Fuzzy logic"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Neural networks"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Neuro-fuzzy"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608008001937", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608008001937", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "58249086998", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-58249086998", "pubmed-id": "19004614", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/58249086998", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20081009", "$": "2008-10-09"}}}}}
