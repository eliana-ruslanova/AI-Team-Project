Responses of living cells to their environment suggest that they possess some \u201cinnate intelligence\u201d. Such responses have been modeled by a cybernetic approach. Furthermore, the overall behavior of a bioreactor containing a population of cells may be described and controlled through artificial intelligence methods. Therefore, it seems logical to combine cybernetic models with artificial intelligence to evolve an integrated intelligence-based strategy that is physiologically more faithful than the current approaches. This possibility is discussed, together with practical considerations favoring a hybrid approach that includes some mathematical modeling.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Cellular intelligence"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial intelligence"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Cybernetic model"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hybrid model"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0734975005001011", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734975005001011", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "31644435763", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-31644435763", "pubmed-id": "16171965", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/31644435763", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20050919", "$": "2005-09-19"}}}}}
