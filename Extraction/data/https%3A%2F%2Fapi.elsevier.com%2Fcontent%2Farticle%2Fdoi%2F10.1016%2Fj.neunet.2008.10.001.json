The mixed time-delays that consist of both the discrete and distributed time-delays are addressed, for the first time, when analyzing the asymptotic stability for discrete-time neural networks. The activation functions are not required to be differentiable or strictly monotonic. The existence of the equilibrium point is first proved under mild conditions. By constructing a new Lyapnuov\u2013Krasovskii functional, a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach is developed to establish sufficient conditions for the discrete-time neural networks to be globally asymptotically stable. As an extension, we further consider the stability analysis problem for the same class of neural networks but with state-dependent stochastic disturbances. All the conditions obtained are expressed in terms of LMIs whose feasibility can be easily checked by using the numerically efficient Matlab LMI Toolbox. A simulation example is presented to show the usefulness of the derived LMI-based stability condition.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Discrete-time neural networks"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Stochastic neural networks"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Asymptotic stability"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Discrete time-delays"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Distributed time-delays"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Lyapunov\u2013Krasovskii functional"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Linear matrix inequality"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608008002116", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608008002116", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "58249090775", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-58249090775", "pubmed-id": "19028076", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/58249090775", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20081018", "$": "2008-10-18"}}}}}
