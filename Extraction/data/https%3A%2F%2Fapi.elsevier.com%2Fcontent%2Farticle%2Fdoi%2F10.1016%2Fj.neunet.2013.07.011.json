The Self-Organizing Hidden Markov Model Map (SOHMMM) establishes a cross-section between the theoretic foundations and algorithmic realizations of its constituents. The respective architectures and learning methodologies are fused in an attempt to meet the increasing requirements imposed by the properties of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), and protein chain molecules. The fusion and synergy of the SOM unsupervised training and the HMM dynamic programming algorithms bring forth a novel on-line gradient descent unsupervised learning algorithm, which is fully integrated into the SOHMMM. Since the SOHMMM carries out probabilistic sequence analysis with little or no prior knowledge, it can have a variety of applications in clustering, dimensionality reduction and visualization of large-scale sequence spaces, and also, in sequence discrimination, search and classification. Two series of experiments based on artificial sequence data and splice junction gene sequences demonstrate the SOHMMM\u2019s characteristics and capabilities.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Self-Organizing Map (SOM)"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hidden Markov Model (HMM)"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Unsupervised learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Clustering"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Spatiotemporal"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "DNA/RNA/protein sequences"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608013001974", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608013001974", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84883350813", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84883350813", "pubmed-id": "24001407", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84883350813", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20130813", "$": "2013-08-13"}}}}}
