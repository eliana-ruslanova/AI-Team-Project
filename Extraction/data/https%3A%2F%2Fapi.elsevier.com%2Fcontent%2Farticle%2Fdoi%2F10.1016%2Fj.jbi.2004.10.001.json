A Bayesian network coding scheme for annotating biomedical information presented to genetic counseling clients Nancy Green \u204e nlgreen@uncg.edu Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Greensboro, NC 27402-6170, United States \u204e Fax: +1 336 334 5949 Abstract We developed a Bayesian network coding scheme for annotating biomedical content in layperson-oriented clinical genetics documents. The coding scheme supports the representation of probabilistic and causal relationships among concepts in this domain, at a high enough level of abstraction to capture commonalities among genetic processes and their relationship to health. We are using the coding scheme to annotate a corpus of genetic counseling patient letters as part of the requirements analysis and knowledge acquisition phase of a natural language generation project. This paper describes the coding scheme and presents an evaluation of intercoder reliability for its tag set. In addition to giving examples of use of the coding scheme for analysis of discourse and linguistic features in this genre, we suggest other uses for it in analysis of layperson-oriented text and dialogue in medical communication. Keywords Content annotation Content analysis Intercoder agreement Bayesian network Genetic counseling Clinical genetics Patient communication Natural language generation Natural language processing Discourse annotation 1 Introduction As information about human genetics has increased rapidly in the last few years, so have genetic testing options such as newborn screening for inherited disorders, testing for genetic predispositions to certain types of cancer, and testing for genetic variations that may determine the effectiveness of certain medications. In the USA, genetic counselors meet with clients to discuss testing options, risk of complications, interpretation of test results, diagnosis of inherited conditions, and recurrence risks. An important function of the counselor is to provide educational counseling, i.e., to provide information in terms that are comprehensible to a lay person. The patient letter is a standard document written by a genetic counselor to her client summarizing the services and information provided to the client [1]. We are analyzing a corpus of patient letters written by genetic counselors to gain knowledge for the design of a computer-supported health communication system for clinical genetics. Employing various artificial intelligence methods, including natural language generation (NLG) techniques [2], the proposed system will automatically produce the first draft of a patient letter using general information on clinical genetics from a knowledge base and documentation about the client\u2019s case from her healthcare providers. By generating a first draft, the system could save the counselor time, as well as provide her with easy access to information on related research and patient resources. Note that it is not the goal of the proposed system to automate problem-solving tasks such as recommending testing, performing diagnosis, or calculating risk, but rather to provide support to healthcare professionals in performing patient-tailored communication tasks. Many NLG-capable systems synthesize texts in a target language, such as English, starting from a nonlinguistic representation of information stored in a knowledge base (KB); also, the systems may separate the task of discourse planning, automatically selecting relevant information from a KB and determining how to organize it into structural units of discourse, from the task of linguistic realization, automatically synthesizing sentences to convey the selected information [2]. Our analysis of a corpus of clinical genetics patient letters follows a related three-way division. First, we are analyzing the biomedical content of the letters to help design a nonlinguistic KB for the health communication system and to provide an abstraction of the letters\u2019 contents to facilitate the next two levels of analysis. Second, we are analyzing (discourse) structural devices in the letters. Third, we are analyzing their (sentential) linguistic features. Analyzing a corpus of sample documents as one of the first steps towards design of the generation components of a system is a standard methodology in the NLG field for understanding user requirements and characteristics of the target genre 1 While corpus analysis often is useful for knowledge acquisition at the beginning of an NLG project, it does not obviate the need for system evaluation by users [2]. 1 . In addition to the goal of developing this NLG system for genetic counselors, another, broader, objective of our research is to analyze problems in communication of biomedical information to lay persons and to investigate potential solutions for use in NLG systems. For example, challenges in clinical genetics patient communication that are shared with other areas of medicine include explanation of risk and explanation of the diagnostic process and its use of evidential reasoning and statistical data. For the biomedical content level of analysis of this corpus, we have devised a coding scheme for representing causal and probabilistic relationships among concepts at a level of abstraction that captures commonalities among genetic processes and their relationship to health. The result of applying the coding scheme to a patient letter is to model its content in a Bayesian network (BN) formalism [3,4]. Although systems using BNs have been developed for automated genetic risk analysis [5] and other biomedical decision support applications, e.g., [6\u20138], we know of no previous work in which a BN-based approach has been used for content annotation of text or dialogue corpora. While the initial motivation for developing the coding scheme was to support our NLG research efforts, it provides a way of encoding biomedical content in this genre that should be useful for future research on patient communication in clinical genetics. Furthermore, our general approach to representing biomedical content in a BN formalism may be useful for applications requiring (manual or automated) analysis of patient-oriented documents in other areas of medicine. In this paper, we present the biomedical content coding scheme and a formal evaluation of the intercoder reliability of its initial tag set, which we found to be very good. Then, we briefly illustrate how we have used the coding scheme for analysis of the corpus. In addition, we propose how to automate the content annotation process and explore other uses of the coding scheme. 2 A Bayesian network coding scheme 2.1 Overview Essentially, the coding scheme consists of a relatively small set of tags relevant to clinical genetics and constraints on their inter-relationships. Although there are more than 5000 known human genetic disorders [9], with many different direct and indirect effects, our coding scheme provides a more abstract representation that is based on commonalities among genetic processes and their relationship to health. For example, two completely different genotypes discussed in the letters, such as the genotype related to Velocardiofacial (VCF) syndrome and the genotype related to Neurofibromatosis (NF), would both be tagged as referring to the more abstract concept of genotype. 2 In clinical genetics, genotype refers to the two copies, or alleles, of a particular gene in an individual\u2019s genome. One copy is inherited from the mother, and the other from the father. In Mendelian autosomal dominant or recessive disorders, the presence of one or two abnormal copies of a gene, respectively, may result in health problems. 2 Also, different health problems, such as a birth defect or a developmental delay, would each be tagged as referring to the more abstract concept of symptom. In addition to classifying the concepts described in a letter, the encoding tracks which family member is described by a tagged phrase. For example, patient letters often discuss a known or hypothesized genotype of the mother and father of a patient. The potential causal relationships among these concepts can be represented in a graphical format as shown in Fig. 1 , where arrows depict possible direct causal relationships. The graph shown in Fig. 1 can be viewed as a simple Bayesian network (BN), where each node (depicted as a rectangle) of the network graph represents a discrete-valued random variable. The text inside the rectangles in Fig. 1 includes several types of information. The labels genotype and symptom are tags in our coding scheme denoting variable types. A tag appended with a numeral, e.g., genotype-1, is a variable name. (As we discuss later, due to repeated mentions of the same concept in a text, a BN variable may be identified by more than one name.) For illustrative purposes, Fig. 1 also shows the domain of each variable, e.g., 0, 1, or 2 copies of VCF mutation 3 i.e., zero, one, or two abnormal copies of the gene related to VCF. 3 . Also, the text inside a rectangle indicates which family member (e.g., the patient\u2019s mother) is described by the variable. Directed arcs (depicted as arrows) in a BN represent dependencies among random variables. For example, the probability that the child has inherited a copy of the VCF mutation is conditionally dependent on whether or not his mother and father are carriers of the mutation, and the parents\u2019 genotypes have a causal influence on their child\u2019s genotype. The coding scheme enables an analyst to construct BN graphs representing the biomedical content of a letter in the corpus at this level of abstraction. To illustrate, first an encoded excerpt from a letter in the corpus is given in Fig. 2 . In the figure, numbers in parentheses on the left are sentence identification numbers. Text in upper case enclosed in square brackets has been substituted for original text in places to preserve client anonymity. Each annotation added by the analyst is shown in bold font immediately following a left angle bracket. Following current convention in markup languages, the angle brackets enclose the phrase 4 The coder is instructed to place the closing (right) angle bracket immediately after the syntactic head of a tagged phrase; thus, post-head modifiers such as prepositional phrases and relative clauses will not appear inside the brackets even though they are understood as contributing to the specification of the tagged concept. 4 in the text to which the tag applies. For example, according to the analyst\u2019s judgment the phrase Velocardiofacial syndrome in sentence 4 represents a random variable of type genotype, to which the analyst has assigned the name genotype-4. In other words, the tagged phrase is evidence that the letter is about a concept, labeled genotype-4, that is a subtype of the concept of genotype, where genotype-4 is the pair of alleles in the patient\u2019s genome that is associated with VCF syndrome. 5 In the corpus as well as in the related literature, we have observed use of the same string of words to refer to a kind of symptom or to the genotype associated with that symptom; thus, an analyst may need to take context into consideration when deciding which of the tags is appropriate. 5 Also, as illustrated in Fig. 2, family relationship terms are appended by the analyst following a delimiter symbol (\u2018/\u2019) to variable names. In this excerpt, only the child of the client, encoded by the analyst as proband, was discussed. 6 Proband is a term in genetics that refers to an individual of interest, i.e., in this context, the client\u2019s child. Following convention in genetics, in the coding scheme family relationship terms such as mother and brother always are specified relative to the proband. 6 However, rather than applying to a specific individual in the client\u2019s family, a tagged phrase may refer to a family member\u2019s counterpart in the general population. In the coding scheme, this type of phrase is dually annotated with population and with the family member annotation that is most relevant to the client\u2019s case. For example, in (5) in Fig. 2, several tags include the suffix population/proband, indicating that the tagged phrase is about the proband\u2019s counterpart in the general population, rather than the specific person discussed in the rest of the excerpt. In addition to assigning family member and population annotations, the analyst identifies which tagged phrases corefer to the same attribute of an individual. For example, the phrases tagged as result-7/proband and result-8/proband in Fig. 2 corefer to the proband\u2019s same test result. A BN diagram constructed from the encoding of the full letter containing the excerpt given in Fig. 2 is given in Fig. 3 . This BN diagram shows only variables that refer to the client\u2019s specific family. Another BN diagram would be constructed to show the variables bearing the population annotation, as in sentence (5). Also, not every tag in in Fig. 2 referring to the client\u2019s family appears as a separate node in the BN diagram; e.g., result-7/proband and result-8/proband do not appear as separate nodes in Fig. 3 since in the analyst\u2019s judgment they corefer with the concept tagged as result-1/proband that has been used as a node label. Associated with each node is a list of coreferences giving the identification numbers of coreferring variables, e.g., the list for result-1/proband in the figure indicates that it corefers with result-7/proband and result-8/proband. Figs. 2 and 3 include some variable types and other notation that have not been discussed yet but which will be covered in the rest of Section 2. For a complete description of the coding scheme, see [10]. 7 For example, the manual describes the constraints on dependencies between variable types. 7 2.2 Tag set Table 1 gives the full set of BN tags in the coding scheme. The initial tag set was intended to cover single-gene autosomal disorders (i.e., non-sex-linked disorders following Mendelian inheritance patterns), representing over 4500 diseases and affecting 1% of the population [9]. The initial tag set was developed based on qualitative analysis of three letters from the corpus and clinical genetics textbooks. An evaluation of the intercoder reliability of the initial tag set is given in Section 3. The extended tag set (the initial set and two additional tags) is designed to cover chromosomal and multifactorial disorders, which represent more than 100 diseases each, and which affect 0.5% and 5\u201310% of the population, respectively [9]. The extended set was developed based on qualitative analysis of four more letters from the corpus (two on chromosomal disorders and two on multifactorial disorders) and textbooks, but has not yet been formally evaluated for intercoder reliability. All of the tags except probability, whose role is discussed in Section 2.3, represent BN variable types. As stated above, the tag set was designed to cover a wide range of genetic disorders but at a level of abstraction that enables regularities in communication to be stated independently of particular genes, types of mutations, proteins, etc. We are not claiming that this level of abstraction is sufficient for representation of content in the genetics or biomedical research literature, but it does seem sufficient for our purposes, i.e., for the generation of information about human genetics and its relation to health as portrayed to the layperson, e.g., in patient letters. 8 In a pilot study reported in [11], we coded three letters and compared the total number of BN tags assigned (51) to sentences (102), which gives a rough idea of the high degree of relevance of the tag set to the letters. 8 The tags were chosen with the goal of providing enough categories to be useful for describing patient-tailored communication without compromising intercoder reliability. For example, two categories, finding and symptom, were merged into one, symptom, after informal testing suggested that coders would have difficulty in reliably discriminating the two classifications. Note that the BN models developed for applications in medicine, e.g., [5\u20138], differ in several respects from models constructed using our tag set. First, the Bayesian networks (i.e., the particular nodes and topology) in those systems were designed for medical reasoning tasks rather than for analysis of communication; thus, the design of those BNs was subject to different constraints, including efficiency constraints. Second, the developers of those systems were not constrained as we are by the goal of intercoder reliability. Despite the apparent simplicity of our coding scheme, the BN graphs constructed from letters in our corpus using this tag set sometimes demonstrate a high degree of complexity of content to be communicated to the layperson. 2.3 Probabilistic and causal dependencies A Bayesian network is defined formally as a directed acyclic graph whose nodes represent discrete-valued random variables and whose arcs represent direct dependencies between variables; the relationship between directly connected nodes is described by a conditional probability distribution given with each node in a conditional probability table (CPT) [4]. For example, in a fully specified BN with the structure shown in Fig. 1, the CPT associated with genotype-3, would give P(genotype-3 \u2223 genotype-1, genotype-2) for all values of genotype-1 and genotype-2, as in Table 2 . (The values in this case are based on a Mendelian model of autosomal recessive inheritance. In general, CPT values also may be supplied by domain experts or based on epidemiological data.) In addition to probabilistic relationships, BN dependencies often correspond to causal relationships. In Fig. 1 for example, all of the arcs may be interpreted causally. Although it is not possible to acquire most of the numeric probability values required to fully specify a CPT from a typical letter in the corpus, the letters do provide some of this information. Usually, however, mainly qualitative descriptions of probability values are given in the letters, e.g., the expression (\u2018could\u2019) tagged as probability-8 in (8) of Fig. 2. Also, while a CPT only specifies probabilities in the form P(Y|X1,\u2026,X n ), where X1,\u2026,X n are the direct predecessors of Y in the BN, letters in the corpus express other related conditional probability statements. For example, (8) in Fig. 2 could be analyzed as conveying the conditional probability P(genotype-8\u2223symptom-8, result-8), which (although related by Bayes theorem) is not equivalent to P(symptom-8, result-8\u2223genotype-8). When annotating a letter with the tags shown in Table 1, a coder also constructs BN diagrams depicting relationships among variables in the letters. Reflecting a layperson-oriented model of clinical genetics, the coding scheme specifies the dependencies between the various node types. All dependencies are probabilistic and most but not all are causal. For example, a history node for an individual I may be directly linked to a karyotype node for I; such an arc is probabilistic but not causal, i.e., as the age of the mother increases, the risk of chromosomal abnormalities increases, but age does not cause the abnormalities. The formal properties of a BN determine the updated posterior probability of any of its variables as evidence is acquired about other variables. As healthcare professionals involved in a case gather evidence, the posterior probabilities of hypotheses about the diagnosis or predictions may change. Thus, a BN can be used to model the process of diagnosis and prediction of health effects and recurrence risks that are reported in patient letters. Initially, a BN (which we term BNpopulation) can be used to model background knowledge relevant to a case as reported in a letter. For an example of BNpopulation, see Fig. 4 , which was constructed by a coder just from variables affixed with population derived from the same letter as the one from which Fig. 3 was constructed. Another BN (which we term BNpre-test) can be used to model the beliefs of the healthcare professionals about the case after revising BNpopulation based upon all observations made prior to testing reported in the letter, e.g., the proband\u2019s history and physical findings. Another BN (which we term BNpost-test) can be used to model the revised beliefs of the healthcare professionals after the test results reported in the letter were available. In addition to BN arcs, an analyst may represent several types of possible semantic relationships between concepts in the diagram. For example, in Fig. 3, a line represents the relationship between test-4.2 and genotype-4, which we term semantic association (not to be confused with statistical association). In other words, we are not interested in modeling the likelihood of a test, given genotype; instead, we wish to model which test enables a genotype to lead to a particular result. 9 Strictly speaking, the test node type in our coding scheme is a kind of intervention variable [4]. 9 Semantic notation is used to represent group\u2013member relationships when a letter contains text referring to individual symptoms and other text referring to the collection of these symptoms; for example, in the letter depicted in Fig. 3, the symptoms tagged as symptom-2.1 and symptom-2.2 comprise the group of symptoms tagged as symptom-8. Also, semantic notation is used to represent type-subtype relationships; e.g., in the letter depicted in Fig. 3, genotype-2 (the set of genotypes tested) is interpreted by the analyst as a subset of genotype-8 (the set of all genotypes that could be responsible for the proband\u2019s symptoms). Although each relationship shown in a BN diagram could be encoded just in written notation by the analyst, we have found that a pictorial rendering of the information is useful. 10 For a discussion on automatic construction of the BN diagrams, see Section 4.3. 10 A BN diagram provides the analyst with a concise pictorial representation of what types of concepts and what probabilistic and (sometimes) causal interrelationships among them the writer intended to communicate. In using a variable numbering scheme related to text position and in including coreferring variable names in the diagram, the diagram enables the analyst to view the order of presentation of concepts and the frequency with which concepts were covered. It also provides the analyst with a visualization of the relative complexity of different text segments. 11 In Section 5.2, we discuss how complexity metrics might be defined in terms of the BN representing a text. 11 2.4 Related work in natural language generation and discourse analysis There has been previous NLG research on generation of arguments from domain knowledge and user models represented in Bayesian networks [12,13]. However, those projects did not develop or use BN based coding schemes for analyzing communication in the target genre. Also, the BNs used in those projects were not designed to model clinical genetics. In the last decade, there has been considerable interest in development of coding schemes for discourse analysis, such as schemes for classification of speech acts in dialogue (e.g. [14]), subjectivity and affect in newspaper articles (e.g. [15]), and rhetorical moves in scientific articles [16]. However, none have addressed the encoding of an underlying biomedical domain model as we have. A common methodological concern in research on discourse analysis has been the formal evaluation of the reliability of the coding schemes used. We address this issue with respect to our coding scheme in the next section. 3 Evaluation of intercoder reliability 3.1 Overview In this section, we report the results of a formal evaluation of the intercoder reliability (reproducibility) of the initial tag set, which covers single-factor autosomal disorders. Our goal was to measure to what extent, given sufficient training, different coders would agree on the representation of the content of a genetic counseling patient letter using our coding scheme. Verifying intercoder reliability is important to ensure that the corpus will be annotated consistently. 12 It is also needed to provide a standard against which automated tagging results can be compared. 12 A basic measure of intercoder agreement on classification tasks in computational linguistics was used for this purpose, the Kappa coefficient [17]. 3.2 Coders and training procedure A coding manual [10] was written for training purposes by the author following a pilot study of the coding scheme [11]. Two paid coders (R and S) had just completed the first year of study in a Master of Science in Genetic Counseling program. They each received a total of 20h of training. Training included an orientation meeting, self-study of the coding manual, practice coding of two sample letters, and two other meetings to discuss the practice coding exercises. The third coder (K), a graduate student in computer science with an undergraduate degree in biology, had acquired expert knowledge of the coding scheme through work with the author during the writing of the coding manual. That work included reviewing the manual for clarity and consensus coding with the author of several letters used for coder training. 3.3 Testing procedure Information about the letters used in development of the coding scheme, training, and the evaluation (testing) is shown in Table 3 . The four letters from the corpus used for the formal evaluation (a total of 238 sentences, or 4670 words) are identified in Table 3 as GL, OI, MN, and AC. These letters had not been read by the author of this paper or by the coders before the evaluation. The coders used standard desktop computer programs to insert annotations into the letters and to draw BN diagrams. The coders were instructed that they could consult the coding manual, coded letters used in training, or genetics reference materials as needed, but not to discuss the work with each other. They were allowed to take as much time as needed and were asked to keep track of time spent on each letter. The total time reported by each of the genetic counseling student coders (R and S) was 18.25 and 17.5h. 3.4 Segmentation issues To compute intercoder agreement on the annotation of the text, it is necessary to count how many times a pair of coders assigns the same tag to the same unit (segment) of a text. A potential problem is that two coders may agree that a sentence in a letter conveys the same concept with reference to the same individual, but may not place brackets for the tag around the same string of words in the sentence. For example, one coder may place angle brackets around a region of the sentence that overlaps with the region bracketed by the other coder. In other cases, each coder may assign the tag for the same concept to one of two non-overlapping regions. In either case, the coders essentially agree on the corresponding concept in the BN, which is what we would like the evaluation to reflect. To give an example, consider sentence (20) from letter HL: \u201cOne allele for the GJB2 gene is inherited from our mother while the other allele is inherited from our father.\u201d While the reader probably would agree with us that the sentence discusses the three concepts, the GJB2 genotype of a mother, father, and child, one coder may tag our mother, while another coder may tag one allele, one allele of the GJB2 gene, or the GJB2 gene, as the segment referring to the mother\u2019s genotype; similar problems may arise in deciding where to place tags in the sentence for segments referring to the genotypes of the father and child. As Carletta et al. [14] note 13 They attribute this point to Krippendorf [18]. 13 , when one coding judgment (such as assigning a tag in our coding scheme to a segment) depends on another (in our case, choosing the string of words to bear the tag) the second judgment \u201ccannot be reasonable unless the first also is\u201d (p. 25). Therefore, following Carletta et al.\u2019s approach, we decided to measure the intercoder agreement of our tag set only for those text segments tagged by both coders. To identify segments tagged by both coders, first, the author of this paper segmented each sentence in a letter based on syntactic criteria into minimal syntactic constituents (MSC). Then we identified which MSC were tagged by both coders. Only those segments tagged by both were used in the evaluation described in the next section. Before reporting the main results in the next section, in the rest of this section we provide supplementary information on an analysis of the extent to which coders agreed on which particular segments (MSC) in a sentence to tag. To do so, we constructed a contingency table for each letter representing agreement on segmentation. For example, coders R and S tagged the same 80 segments in letter OI. (Those 80 segments were the only segments used for the intercoder reliability evaluation of the tag set described in the next section for that pair of coders for that letter.) The Kappa statistic for segmentation was then computed from these contingency tables for all letters (see Table 4 ). Although the segmentation results indicate a level of agreement whose lower range is in some cases below the current norm 14 Following Krippendorf [18], over 0.8. 14 in computational linguistics, the lower range would be considered to be moderate to substantial by medical researchers [19]. 3.5 Intercoder reliability of tag set Having identified the segments as described in the preceding section, we proceeded to compute the Kappa statistic for the tag set by counting the number of times each pair of coders assigned the same tag and family member designator (e.g., proband, mother, etc.) to the same segment, for segments that both coders tagged. 15 For segments that were annotated with more than one tag, each instance of agreement was counted separately. 15 The final results, shown in Table 5 , indicate that the initial tag set can be applied with a high degree of intercoder agreement, ranging between 0.8290 and 1. 16 This level is characterized as almost perfect on Landis and Koch\u2019s [19] scale and as reliable in Krippendorf\u2019s [18] scale. 16 4 Uses of coding scheme Fig. 5 depicts the role of the annotated letters in our process of NLG system development. 17 Subprocesses are denoted by rectangles. Currently, coding and analysis are performed manually, but may be partially automated as discussed in Section 4.3. 17 As mentioned in Section 1, our goal in annotating the biomedical content of letters in the corpus is to help design the KB and to analyze the structural (discourse-level) devices and linguistic (sentence-level) features of this genre. The coded letters and other sources of information are being used to design the KB as a BN. 18 Technically speaking, the KB is implemented as a hybrid BN/qualitative probabilistic network (QPN) [20] to avoid the requirement to acquire numerical probability values for all variables in the network, and since in many cases only qualitative assessment of probability is required [21]. 18 The role of the KB in the system is to store information in a way that enables the system to model the reasoning of the genetic counselor when the system is composing the first draft of the patient letter for the counselor. For example, suppose that the counselor informs the system that the result of the proband\u2019s test for a change in the gene GJB2 is positive and that the clinic\u2019s diagnosis is that this change is likely to be responsible for the proband\u2019s hearing loss. Now, in composing the first draft of the patient letter, the system can use its generic causal model in the KB for this type of hearing loss to compose a client-tailored explanation of the bearing of the evidence from the test results on the diagnosis. Also, the system could include additional information from the research literature stored in the KB related to the diagnosis. The purpose of performing an analysis of discourse-level devices and linguistic features of this genre is twofold: to ensure that the letters drafted by the system are consistent with current practice in terms of topics, organization, writing style, etc.; and to provide the system with knowledge that it can generalize to draft letters covering many scenarios, not just those represented in the corpus. Since the biomedical content coding scheme captures commonalities among genetic processes and their relationship to health, it enables structural and linguistic regularities to be stated at a higher level of abstraction than in terms of specific terminology (or specific genes and health problems under discussion) found in the corpus. This facilitates generalizing communication strategies found in the corpus to new scenarios, i.e., other genetic disorders. Examples are given in the next two sections. 4.1 Analysis of discourse Genre analysis identifies major discourse structures, called moves, that characterize a genre [22]. For example, our analysis of the corpus has identified a very common move, occurring after the opening of a letter, whose communicative goal is to document the diagnostic process. The steps of this move, which we call Document Diagnostic Process, track successive transformations of the BN, starting from an initial state (BNpopulation) describing the general population based on epidemiological studies and probability \u201claws\u201d of Mendelian inheritance, and ending in a state that reflects all patient-specific observations including test results (BNpost-test). For example, this move may include the following steps: \u2022 Describe diagnostic reasoning leading to initial set of candidate diagnoses after BNpopulation has been updated with symptoms and history observed by referring doctor (resulting in BNpre-test). \u2022 Describe diagnostic reasoning leading to final set of candidate diagnoses after BNpre-test has been updated with test results (resulting in BNpost-test). Note that the moves are described at the level of abstraction of the coding scheme, rather than in terms of specific symptoms, tests, and genotypes mentioned in particular letters in the corpus, so that they can be applied to new scenarios in this domain. In addition to defining moves required for the current application, we have been analyzing the encoded corpus to identify general forms of causal argumentation used in patient-tailored communication. Knowledge gained from the analysis will contribute to our broader research goals of developing computer systems to help lay audiences to understand medical and other scientific information [23]. 4.2 Analysis of linguistic features for communication of uncertainty To understand better how probability is conveyed in this lay-oriented genre, we are using the coding scheme\u2019s tag set to encode the probability statements given in each letter. For example, (5) in Fig. 2 could be encoded as P(symptom-5.1, symptom-5.2|genotype-5)= probability-5, where probability-5 is a qualitative description of frequency (\u2018often\u2019). This is an example of a retrospective probability statement, which provides the frequency of an observable condition (e.g., symptom-5.1) for a population in which the cause is known (e.g., genotype-5). Eddy [24] distinguishes retrospective from predictive probability statements, in which the likelihood of a hypothesis is stated given knowledge of observables. For example, (8) in Fig. 2 could be analyzed as conveying the predictive probability statement P(genotype-8/symptom-8, result-8)= probablity-8, where probability-8 is a qualitative description of likelihood (\u2018could\u2019). Typically, retrospective statements are the form found in the research literature (and correspond to the form of the conditional probability table of a BN), whereas predictive statements are in a form that may be more useful to a patient interested in his diagnosis. In a pilot study reported in [11], we found a surprisingly high proportion of probability statements to sentences in a sample of three patient letters from the corpus. Moreover, in those three letters the ratio of retrospective to predictive statements ranged from roughly equal numbers of each type to roughly half as many retrospective as predictive statements. Since even experts may confuse retrospective and predictive probabilities [24], it is important to understand how they are used and then, perhaps, to offer the writer an alternative formulation in the generated first draft of the patient letter. In addition, we classify probability statements in the corpus as progressive when the order of presentation of variables in the text matches the causal direction in the BN, or regressive when the variables are given in the reverse of the causal direction. For example, (8) in Fig. 2 would be classified as regressive. We are interested in tracking this aspect of usage since presentation order may influence comprehensiblity. In the same pilot study, we found the ratio of regressive to progressive statements to range from roughly equal to roughly half as many regressive as progressive forms. In addition to linguistic expression of uncertainty, we are using the encoded corpus to facilitate analysis of other linguistic features [25]. In particular, we have identified different perspectives that may be signaled by choice of wording and syntactic variation. For example, parts of a letter included for purposes of medical documentation and which reflect the referring doctor\u2019s perspective are characterized by use of medical terminology. However, parts of a letter reflecting the educational counseling perspective are characterized by use of non-technical and (so-called) non-stigmatizing language (e.g., \u2018alteration\u2019 instead of \u2018mutation\u2019). Thus, the encoded corpus can be used to study the different ways in which the same kinds of information may be conveyed for different purposes. 4.3 Automating tagging Although the coding scheme was created initially for manual analysis of our corpus, in the future we would like to automate the process as much as is feasible. 19 Coding letters manually is time-consuming and limits the size of the corpus that is feasible to study. 19 In this section, we outline a proposal for automating the tagging process for documents in this genre. The first step would be to identify biomedical terms in the document using supplementary resources, some of which we shall describe briefly here. The goal of the Gene Ontology Consortium (GOC) [26] project is to develop controlled vocabularies for the description of genes and gene products to support cross-database queries in collaborating databases. The project\u2019s three controlled vocabularies describe gene products in terms of biological processes, cellular components, and molecular function. The vocabularies are organized as directed acyclic graphs, whose arcs represent semantic dependencies. The National Library of Medicine\u2019s Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) provides knowledge sources for biomedicine and health-related concepts [27]. The UMLS Metathesaurus is a comprehensive vocabulary database; all of its concepts are assigned a semantic type in the UMLS Semantic Network, containing 135 semantic types and 54 relationships. In addition, UMLS provides SPECIALIST, a lexicon of general English words and biomedical terms, and associated lexical processing computer programs. To compare our coding scheme to these resources, our tag set can be viewed as a subset of possible concepts in the UMLS Semantic Network, and a tagged phrase from a patient letter could correspond to a term in a GOC or UMLS thesaurus. Also, the non-BN relations (association, group\u2013member, and subtype) encoded in our approach are semantic relationships. However, a key difference is that our approach is based on a BN formalism. Thus, it is possible to model causal and probabilistic dependencies supporting causal probabilistic inference patterns. 20 For a discussion of types of inferences supported by Bayesian networks, see e.g., [4]. Examples include reasoning from cause to effect (prediction), from effect to cause (diagnosis), and explaining away. In contrast, semantic networks support taxonomic inference. 20 Another key difference is that our tag set has been designed for and demonstrated to have good intercoder reliability. Nevertheless, these resources could be invaluable in automating the tagging process. As noted above, the first step would be to identify biomedical terms in the document using supplementary resources such as the UMLS Thesaurus. Next, the recognized biomedical terms could be associated with their superordinate categories in the UMLS Semantic Network. Hand-crafted rules could be specified mapping the superordinate categories to the tags in our coding scheme. Thus, it seems it will be relatively straightforward to automate this aspect of tagging. However, what if the goal were to automatically derive a BN diagram representing the content of the document? After tagging the type of variable, the following issues would still need to be addressed: \u2022 Deciding to which member of the patient\u2019s family (or counterpart in the general population) a tagged phrase refers. This would require natural language processing, e.g., to identify possessive modifiers and to resolve anaphoric references. To give an example illustrating the challenge in automating this step, consider the problem of tagging sentence (6) in letter HL: \u201cAs with most children with genetic hearing loss, [PROBAND] has no unusual features and has what is called \u2018isolated\u2019 or \u2018non-syndromic\u2019 hearing loss.\u201d The subordinate clause, as with most children with genetic hearing loss, indirectly conveys that the actual patient is a child with hearing loss, though directly referring only to a non-specific child with hearing loss. Conversely, the main clause, [PROBAND] has no unusual features and has what is called \u2018isolated\u2019 or \u2018non-syndromic\u2019 hearing loss, directly refers to features of the actual patient but indirectly refers to those same features in the generic child. The coding should reflect that the sentence describes analogous concepts with reference both to the actual patient and his generic counterpart. Thus for example, according to our coding manual, a coder should tag the subordinate clause as follows: As with <probability-6 most> <history-6.1/population/proband// history-6.2/proband children> with <genotype-6.1/population/proband// genotype-6.2/proband genetic> <symptom-6.1/population/proband// symptom-6.2/proband hearing loss>. 21 To explain notation used in the example, when the same phrase is assigned more than one tag, the delimiter \u2018//\u2019 is used to separate the two tags. 21 \u2022 After family relationships have been determined, building the network diagram from the tagged text. This would be straightforward to do using the constraints specified by the coding scheme. In conclusion, our short-term strategy is to do automated tagging of variable types, then use a human coder to verify the tags and assign family member descriptors, and then do automated BN diagram construction from the tagged text. 4.4 Related work on automatic BN construction from document collections Although having different goals from ours, there has been research on automatic construction of Bayesian networks from electronic document collections for biomedical decision support and information retrieval (IR) applications. Antal et al. [28] partially automated construction of a knowledge base to be used in a decision support system for classification of ovarian tumors. Starting with a BN graph of 31 variables created by medical experts, the system applied text mining methods to a document collection to derive the conditional probability tables of the BN as an alternative to the labor-intensive process of eliciting the probabilities from domain experts. The goal of our work described in the preceding section, however, is not to automatically construct the system knowledge base (labeled KB in Fig. 5) from the corpus, but to automate the process of analysis of each letter as much as possible. 22 Nevertheless, analysis of the corpus will contribute to the design of our KB, since we would like the KB to model the variables and causal relationships discussed in the letters. 22 De Campos et al. [29] describe the automatic construction of a BN representing collocational relationships among terms in a document collection. The BN was used as a thesaurus for query expansion to improve recall in IR tasks. Their approach is based on the assumption that terms frequently found in the same documents as terms in the original query should be added to a query to increase the probability of finding documents relevant to the user\u2019s information need. The resulting structure and conditional probabilities of a BN constructed for their goals is different from a BN suitable for representing the diagnostic reasoning, inheritance relationships, and recurrence risks discussed in a letter from our corpus. 5 Other applications 5.1 Analysis of genetic counseling dialogue Although our coding scheme was developed for analysis of biomedical content in text, in this section we briefly explore its application to dialogue. Two coding schemes have been proposed in the genetic counseling literature for the analysis of genetic counseling session dialogue. The goal of those researchers was to provide tools for quantitative analysis of factors influencing counseling effectiveness. Kessler [30] used his proposed scheme to analyze a transcript of a genetic counseling session (first published in [31]). To each interaction unit in the transcript, Kessler assigned one of 12 categories developed by Bales [32], a content descriptor, and one of nine attribution scores. Bales\u2019 classifications are based on linguistic form (e.g., asking or giving a suggestion), affect (e.g., showing antagonism or laughter), and politeness (e.g., interactions raising the other\u2019s status). Kessler did not describe how content descriptors were assigned or if they had been evaluated for intercoder reliability; examples given include amniocentesis, Down syndrome, family history, genetics and genetic risk. The attribution score indicates the relative roles of the participants in an interaction; e.g., an interaction originating from the counselor and directed towards the husband but not the wife, who also was present at the session. Liede et al. [33] developed and formally evaluated the Manchester Observation Code (MOC), a coding scheme for analyzing the counselor\u2019s statements in transcripts of videotaped genetic counseling sessions. Each of the counselor\u2019s statements is classified on four dimensions: grammatical form (e.g., declarative sentence vs. open question), function, i.e., the counselor\u2019s reason for making the statement (e.g., to elicit vs. to give information), content (using seven tags such as genetics vs. social and family factors), and cue source (e.g., whether the patient or counselor initiated the topic). Intercoder reliability of MOC was evaluated formally. The above investigations followed a simpler approach to representing dialogue content than what we have adopted in our analysis of patient letters. It is possible that future studies of counseling dialogue effectiveness would benefit from use of our coding scheme. Thus, as an experiment, we informally analyzed the transcript of a genetic counseling session published in [31] and present a BN diagram for part of it in Fig. 6 . Despite the length of the transcript, the BN diagram depicts the informational content of the session concisely. With additional annotation, such as coreference lists and speaker, the diagram presents the analyst with a visualization of the flow of information during the session. 23 Because of the length of the transcript, we have not included coreference lists in the drawing. 23 5.2 Analysis of complexity and comprehension It is possible to define a number of complexity metrics in terms of this coding scheme for use in studies of communicative effectiveness. For example, the complexity scores of two texts might be the same according to metrics based upon vocabulary and syntactic properties. However, one text might be more complex than the other for a variety of reasons that would be reflected in differences in BN diagrams representing the two texts such as the lengths of causal paths discussed or the number of alternative causal paths discussed. Furthermore, two texts may be about information represented by the same BN diagram, but one text may be more complex than the other because of how the information is conveyed: e.g., a text presenting information in regressive order (in reverse of causal order), or presenting a recurrence risk to the reader as a predictive probability statement rather than as a retrospective probability statement, or presenting a diagnosis to the reader as a retrospective probability statement rather than as a predictive probability statement. Also, it is possible to define comprehension metrics in terms of the coding scheme. For example, one way of testing comprehension in a controlled experiment would be to ask the reader to draw, in essence, a BN representing the causal chain of concepts described in a letter or in a genetic counseling session and comparing that to the BN constructed by a coder from the letter or session transcript. This would be a way of assessing whether the subject only understood and remembered isolated facts, or whether he had acquired a deeper understanding of the causal, probabilistic model underlying the information that was presented. 6 Conclusions We developed and evaluated a coding scheme for clinical genetics patient letters that enables their biomedical content to be modeled in a Bayesian network formalism. An advantage of representing this content in a BN formalism is that it enables one to model causal and probabilistic dependencies and inferences. The coding scheme is at a high enough level of abstraction to capture commonalities among genetic processes and their relationship to health. We are using the coding scheme to analyze a corpus of patient letters written by genetic counselors, as part of a natural language generation project to create a computer system to help the counselors with client communication tasks. The encoded letters are being used to help design the system knowledge base, which models the knowledge and reasoning of a genetic counselor as she writes the first draft of a patient letter. Also, the encoded letters are being used to identify discourse-level devices and linguistic features of this genre. The discourse-linguistic knowledge gained is being used to help ensure that letters drafted by the system are consistent with current practice, and to enable the system to draft letters covering many scenarios, not just those represented in the corpus. The coding scheme was designed with several goals in mind. We selected tags representing concepts at a high enough level of abstraction to enable generalizations about communication strategies to be stated independently of particular genes, proteins, health problems, etc. Another goal was to model the causal and probabilistic model of human genetics presented to a lay audience. Finally, the tag set has good intercoder agreement, as demonstrated by a formal evaluation reported in this paper. Although expensive, verifying intercoder agreement is important not only for ensuring that a corpus will be annotated consistently by human coders, but also to provide a reliable standard to which automated tagging results can be compared. We described a proposal for automating the tagging process in this paper. This approach enables a representation of biomedical content in written and spoken communication to laypersons that goes beyond informal topic identification or even a more sophisticated mapping of phrases to terms in a controlled language. For example, we showed how this approach enables us to analyze the expression of probability statements in the corpus in terms of retrospective-predictive and regressive-progressive distinctions. In addition, we suggested how this approach enables new metrics of complexity and comprehension to be defined. Although developed for lay audience-tailored communication in clinical genetics, this approach may be useful in analysis of lay audience-tailored communication in other medical fields as well.
