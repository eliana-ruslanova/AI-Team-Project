William Grey Walter, a young researcher finishing his post-graduate studies at Cambridge, was selected to construct and study the EEG in clinical neurology at the Maudsley Hospital, London. His hugely productive pioneering career in the use of EEG would eventually lead to groundbreaking work in other fields \u2014the emerging sciences of robotics, cybernetics, and early work in artificial intelligence. In this historical note his pioneering work in the fields of clinical neurophysiology is documented, both in the areas of epileptology and tumour detection. His landmark contributions to clinical neurophysiology are worthy of documentation.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Pioneering electroencephalography"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Epilepsy"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Brain tumour location"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S096758680500398X", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096758680500398X", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "33644514033", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-33644514033", "pubmed-id": "16455257", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33644514033", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20060207", "$": "2006-02-07"}}}}}
