A total of 170 people participated in the survey (59 radiologists, 56 surgeons and 55 students). Statistical analysis was carried out using the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn\u2019s multiple comparison post-hoc tests.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  While the majority of participants agreed that AI should be included as a support system in radiology (Likert scale 0-10: Median value 8), surgeons were less supportive than radiologists (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Students saw a potential threat of AI as more likely than radiologists did (p\u2009=\u20090.041). When asked whether they were concerned about \u201cturf losses\u201d from radiology to other disciplines, radiologists were much more likely to agree than students (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Of the students that do not intend to specialize in radiology, 26 % stated that AI was one of the reasons. Surgeons advocate the use of teleradiology.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  With regard to AI, radiologists expect their workflow to become more efficient and tend to support the use of AI, whereas medical students and surgeons tend to be more skeptical towards this technology. Medical students see AI as a potential threat to diagnostic radiologists, while radiologists themselves are rather afraid of turf losses.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Radiology \u2013 artificial intelligence - students"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Medical \u2013 surveys - questionnaires"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0720048X19303924", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0720048X19303924", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85074887345", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85074887345", "pubmed-id": "31734640", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85074887345", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20191109", "$": "2019-11-09"}}}}}
