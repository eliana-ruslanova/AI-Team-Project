In this study an ESN is shown to contain an antagonistic trade-off between the amount of non-linear mapping and short-term memory it can exhibit when applied to time-series data which are highly non-linear. To overcome this trade-off a new architecture, Reservoir with Random Static Projections (R2SP) is investigated, that is shown to offer a significant improvement in performance. A similar approach using an ELM whose input is presented through a time delay (TD-ELM) is shown to further enhance performance where it significantly outperformed the ESN and R2SP as well other architectures when applied to a novel task which allows the short-term memory and non-linearity to be varied. The hard-limiting memory of the TD-ELM appears to be best suited for the data investigated in this study, although ESN-based approaches may offer improved performance when processing data which require a longer fading memory.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Reservoir computing"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Extreme learning machine"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Reservoir with random static projections"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Non-linearity"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Short-term memory"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Time-series data"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608012003085", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608012003085", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84871651156", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84871651156", "pubmed-id": "23275138", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84871651156", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20121203", "$": "2012-12-03"}}}}}
