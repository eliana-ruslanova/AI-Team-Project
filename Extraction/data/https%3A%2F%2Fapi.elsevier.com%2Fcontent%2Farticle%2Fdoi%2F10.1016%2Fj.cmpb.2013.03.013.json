Microarray images typically contain several thousands of small spots, each of which represents a different gene in the experiment. One of the key steps in extracting information from a microarray image is the segmentation whose aim is to identify which pixels within an image represent which gene. This task is greatly complicated by noise within the image and a wide degree of variation in the values of the pixels belonging to a typical spot. In the past there have been many methods proposed for the segmentation of microarray image. In this paper, a new method utilizing a series of artificial neural networks, which are based on multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and Kohonen networks, is proposed. The proposed method is applied to a set of real-world cDNA images. Quantitative comparisons between the proposed method and commercial software GenePix\u00ae are carried out in terms of the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). This method is shown to not only deliver results comparable and even superior to existing techniques but also have a faster run time.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial neural networks"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Microarray image"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Adaptive segmentation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Kohonen neural networks"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016926071300103X", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016926071300103X", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84878477855", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84878477855", "pubmed-id": "23669179", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84878477855", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20130510", "$": "2013-05-10"}}}}}
