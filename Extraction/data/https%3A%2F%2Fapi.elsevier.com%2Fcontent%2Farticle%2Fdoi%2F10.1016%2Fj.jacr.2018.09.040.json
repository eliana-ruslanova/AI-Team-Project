Open-source BI-RADS data sets were evaluated to see whether inclusion of a radiologist\u2019s opinion (in the form of BI-RADS classification) in addition to image parameters improved the accuracy of prediction of histology using three machine learning algorithms vis-\u00e0-vis algorithms using image parameters alone.\n               \n               \n                  Materials and Methods\n                  BI-RADS data sets were obtained from the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository (data set 1) and the Digital Database for Screening Mammography repository (data set 2); three machine learning algorithms were trained using 10-fold cross-validation. Two sets of models were trained: M1, using lesion shape, margin, density, and patient age for data set 1 and image texture parameters for data set 2, and M2, using the previous image parameters and the BI-RADS classification provided by radiologists. The area under the curve and the Gini coefficient for M1 and M2 were compared for the validation data set.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  The models using the radiologist-provided BI-RADS classification performed significantly better than the models not using them (P < .0001).\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion\n                  AI and radiologist working together can achieve better results, helping in case-based decision making. Further evaluation of the metrics involved in predictor handling by AI algorithms will provide newer insights into imaging.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial intelligence"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "machine learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "radiologist-augmented workflow"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "BI-RADS"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S154614401831202X", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S154614401831202X", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85055103215", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85055103215", "pubmed-id": "30337213", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055103215", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20181015", "$": "2018-10-15"}}}}}
