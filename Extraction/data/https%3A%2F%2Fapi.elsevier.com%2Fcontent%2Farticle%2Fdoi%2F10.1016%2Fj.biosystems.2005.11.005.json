We apply this model to describe cognitive experiments to check quantum-like structures of mental processes. The crucial role is played by interference of probabilities for mental observables. Recently one such experiment based on recognition of images was performed. This experiment confirmed our prediction on the quantum-like behavior of mind. In our approach \u201cquantumness of mind\u201d has no direct relation to the fact that the brain (as any physical body) is composed of quantum particles. We invented a new terminology \u201cquantum-like (QL) mind.\u201d Cognitive QL-behavior is characterized by a nonzero coefficient of interference \n                        \u03bb\n                     . This coefficient can be found on the basis of statistical data. There are predicted not only \n                        cos\n                        \u2061\n                        \u03b8\n                     -interference of probabilities, but also hyperbolic \n                        cosh\n                        \u2061\n                        \u03b8\n                     -interference. This interference was never observed for physical systems, but we could not exclude this possibility for cognitive systems. We propose a model of brain functioning as a QL-computer (there is a discussion on the difference between quantum and QL computers).\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0303264705001942", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303264705001942", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "33745939141", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-33745939141", "pubmed-id": "16427733", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33745939141", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20060120", "$": "2006-01-20"}}}}}
