Support vector machines (SVMs) are used as a new self-regulating classifier trained by gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) of the image. This matrix is calculated at various angles and the texture features are evaluated for classifying the images. Results show that the performance of GLCM-based SVMs is drastically improved over the previous histogram-based SVMs. Our proposed GLCM-based approach of training SVM predicts a robust and more accurate segmentation algorithm than the standard histogram technique, as additional information based on the spatial relationship between pixels is incorporated for image classification. Further, the GLCM-based SVM classifiers were more accurate and required less training data when compared to the artificial neural network (ANN) classifiers.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Particulate matter"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Support vector machines"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Gray level co-occurrence matrix"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Image segmentation"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304389412004475", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389412004475", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84861457954", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84861457954", "pubmed-id": "22595545", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84861457954", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20120430", "$": "2012-04-30"}}}}}
