Abstract A metaschema is an Abstraction Network of the UMLS\u2019s Semantic Network (SN) obtained from a connected partition into its collections of semantic types. A metaschema can support comprehension, visualization and navigation of the SN. In this paper, a methodology is presented to evaluate and compare two given metaschemas, based on their structural properties. This methodology was applied to the top-down metaschema and the bottom-up metaschema, derived from two studies involving two groups of UMLS experts. By the Cronbach alpha estimate, the bottom-up metaschema is reliable, while the top-down metaschema is not. An algorithm was designed to yield a consolidated metaschema enjoying the best and avoiding the worst of the two given metaschemas. The consolidation algorithm was applied to the above two metaschemas, The resulting consolidated metaschema has better structural properties than either of the two metaschemas and better supports user orientation visualization, and navigation of the Semantic Network. Keywords UMLS Semantic Network Abstraction Network Metaschema Comparison Consolidation Evaluation 1 Introduction The Metathesaurus (META) [1,2] and the Semantic Network (SN) [3\u20136] are two knowledge resources of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) [7\u20139]. The META is a valuable concept repository containing more than 1,300,000 (2006 AC) biomedical concepts from various source terminologies. The SN provides a high-level abstraction of the biomedical domain and consists of 135 broad categories called semantic types (STs), by which all concepts of the META are categorized. The SN can help with user orientation and navigation in the large META knowledge base and with interaction with the knowledge embedded in the UMLS. Although the SN provides a high-level abstraction of the META, it is still difficult for a user to obtain full comprehension of the SN, since there are about 7000 non-IS-A semantic relationships connecting pairs of STs. Previous research has been conducted on reducing the complexity of the SN. McCray et al. [10] developed a methodology for aggregating STs into 15 groups based on 6 general principles: semantic validity, parsimony, completeness, exclusivity, naturalness and utility. Kumar et al. [11] used a derivation formalized in predicate logic to reduce the complexity of the SN. We have developed partitioning techniques to obtain a metaschema [12], which serves as a compact abstraction of the SN. According to the definition in [12], a metaschema is an abstraction based on an underlying partition of the SN into connected groups of STs. Each group is represented by a single metasemantic type (MST). The purpose of a metaschema is to present a compact abstraction-level network of the SN, where each MST represents a subject area of the SN. That is, the STs of each subject area constitute a group in the partition underlying the metaschema. Similar to the SN itself, a metaschema of the SN is formally a directed network which consists of a set of nodes, the MSTs, connected via hierarchical meta-child-of relationships and semantic meta-relationships. For more details see Section 2.1. In [13], we extended the notion of a metaschema to a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) network, rather than the tree structure of the SN. We then obtained two different metaschemas from the Enriched Semantic Network [14], which is an extension of the SN having a DAG structure. We designed algorithms to generate two different metaschemas, the cohesive metaschema [12], and the lexical metaschema [15]. Each of these two metaschemas can serve as a higher-level abstract view of the SN to help users\u2019 understanding of the complex SN. An important assumption underlying the construction of these two metaschemas is that even though they are generated by algorithmic processes, they effectively yield subject areas meaningful and useful to a human. In order to evaluate the validity of this assumption, we conducted a heuristic top-down study [16]. In this study, a group of experts, who published on UMLS research or related subjects, was recruited, with each expert charged to derive his/her own metaschema. A consensus metaschema of all the experts\u2019 metaschemas was then derived. However, the result of the top-down study was disappointing, since the metaschemas obtained by the experts varied widely while we expected a good degree of agreement among experts. As a consequence, we introduce in this paper an alternative bottom-up approach. We report in this paper on a second study of experts applying this approach. Naturally, one wants to compare the top-down and the bottom-up consensus metaschemas to find out which is better fitting for evaluating the algorithmatically obtained metaschemas. Since the two consensus metaschemas are results of human considerations, only a comparison and evaluation of their structural properties can be objective. In this paper, we present methods for comparing two metaschemas. We will further introduce several measures to help in assessing the quality of a metaschema for supporting user orientation into the SN. These measures are structural measures, intended to reflect the ease of comprehension and orientation. Those structural measures were used for evaluating the two metaschemas. As will be shown, each of them has pros and cons, in terms of its structural properties. We desire a metaschema that can best facilitate user orientation into the SN, by enjoying the advantages of each of the consensus metaschemas and avoiding their disadvantages. To this end, we have developed an algorithm to obtain a consolidated metaschema of the two given metaschemas. The consolidated metaschema obtained can serve as a yardstick for the measurement of the quality of the metaschemas generated by algorithms [12,15], since it is derived from experts\u2019 metaschemas. We include a glossary of the different metaschemas mentioned in this paper. In [17], Gu et al. use the metaschema paradigm to locate concepts with high likelihood of errors. A metaschema provides various compact partial views of the SN to help users with visualization, orientation and navigation in the SN [12]. The metaschema framework can be extended beyond the UMLS to any dual level terminological system which consists of an upper level terminology of broad categories, in addition to the concept repository, with assignment of categories for every concept. Such a terminological system will have advantages in supporting abstraction, navigation and integration. Metaschemas and their consolidation can further support abstraction of the upper level terminology. One effort in this direction appears with regard to the IEEE Standard Upper Ontology (SUO) [18,19] as an upper level terminology for the WordNet terminology [20]. Assignment of the SUO categories for the WordNet terminology is described in [21]. Another related dual level terminology is suggested in [22] for the Medical Entity Dictionary (MED) [23]. The upper level terminology there is called schema (following the Object-Oriented database paradigm [24]). A partition for this schema is suggested in [25]. This partition can probably serve as a basis for a metaschema of a different kind but further research is needed. In addition to the notion of metaschema, other previous work has focused on different methods to facilitate UMLS knowledge comprehension and visualization. Bodenreider and McCray described how to use visualization of semantic relationships as important indicators to explore coherence of semantic groups and help in auditing and validating the SN [26]. In [27] Nelson et al. presented the Hypercard browser MetaCard to enable users to extend the browsing process from META to a variety of different knowledge sources. In [28], knowledge exploration tools using levels of indentation to represent items standing in hierarchical relationships were used for displaying biomedical hierarchies in environments such as Prot\u00e9g\u00e9-2000. A review of knowledge visualization and navigation in the medical domain was presented by Tuttle et al. in [29]. 2 Background 2.1 A metaschema of the SN The notion of a metaschema was introduced in [12] as an abstraction of the SN. An ST group is called connected if its STs together with their respective IS-A links constitute a connected subgraph of the SN hierarchy with a unique root. A partition is called connected if each of its ST groups is connected. A metaschema is based on a connected partition of the SN, where the SN\u2019s IS-A hierarchy is partitioned into disjoint ST groups. Fig. 1 shows a partition of the Event 1 Semantic types will be written in bold style and MSTs will be written in \u201csmall caps\u201d style. 1 portion of the UMLS SN hierarchy. Each box represents an ST. Each arrow represents an IS-A link. Dotted lines circumscribe groups of STs which are close in meaning to each other. Additionally, while an ST group can be a singleton (i.e., a group of one ST), we require that such an ST cannot be a leaf in the SN\u2019s hierarchy. This condition was imposed because the metaschema should manifest some size reduction of the SN, which singletons do not contribute to. However, a singleton containing a non-leaf ST with more than one child is allowed, since it may express an important internal branching point in the metaschema. For example, in Fig. 1, the singleton {Biologic Function} serves as a branching point for the groups rooted at Physiologic Function and Pathologic Function. In a metaschema, each ST group of the partition is represented by a single node, called a metasemantic type (MST) named after the root of the group. Two kinds of relationships, the hierarchical meta-child-of relationships and the non-hierarchical meta-relationships, connect MSTs. Fig. 2 shows the metaschema hierarchy corresponding to Fig. 1. The number of STs in each MST is listed in parenthesis following its name. A meta-child-of relationship (\u201cmeta-child-of\u201d for short) is a link between two MSTs representing an IS-A relationship between two STs of the corresponding ST groups. More specifically, let A i and B r be STs in the ST groups of MSTs A and B, respectively (see Fig. 3 ). Furthermore, let B r be the root of B and let B r IS-A A i . Then in the metaschema, we define a meta-child-of directed from B to A. Note that the ST A i does not need to be the root of its MST. Only the source B r has to be a root in order for a new meta-child-of to be induced in the metaschema. A meta-relationship is a link between two MSTs representing a specific semantic relationship (non-IS-A relationship) between the two corresponding ST groups (for details see [12]). The derivation of the meta-child-ofs and the meta-relationships is motivated in detail in [12]. For example, the hierarchy of the Event portion of the SN could be partitioned into the eight ST groups shown in Fig. 1. Each semantic-type group is represented by an MST in the corresponding metaschema. An MST Phenomenon or Process is defined to represent the ST group rooted at Phenomenon or Process in Fig. 1. The metaschema hierarchy derived from the partition in Fig. 1 was shown in Fig. 2. Overall, a diagram of a metaschema serves as a good visualization mechanism supporting orientation to the SN and, in turn, the META, and helps in the navigation of the UMLS knowledge. In [12] we introduced various partial graphical views of groups of STs supported by the metaschema paradigm. These views can help in orientation of a user to the full scope of the SN\u2019s semantic relationships. 2.2 Top-down heuristic metaschema An important assumption underlying the construction of the algorithmically generated metaschemas in previous research [12,15] is that the resulting subject areas of the SN are natural to a human. In order to validate this assumption, we conducted the following study [15]. A number of experts with reputation in the UMLS research area or related areas were selected. We sent each expert a diagram of the SN\u2019s IS-A hierarchy, i.e., the two trees rooted at Event and Entity. The experts were asked to partition the SN starting at the roots (i.e., top-down). The design of the study follows the Aristotelian [30] paradigm, where species are specified according to genus and differentiate. Partitioning is done based on the extent of the difference between the child ST and its more general parent ST. Details of this study have appeared in previous publications [12,16] and are omitted. The design of the metaschema utilizes the one-to-one correspondence between the ST groups underlying the MSTs, and their root STs. By selecting a set of STs that are \u201cimportant and quite different\u201d from their parents, a participating expert induces a partition of the SN, where each selected semantic type is a root of its group, implying a corresponding \u201cexpert metaschema.\u201d While studying responses from our 11 UMLS experts, we found that individual participants\u2019 responses varied greatly both in the choice of STs marked as roots of groups and their numbers. For example, experts 1 and 2 chose 21 and 34 STs to name MSTs in their expert metaschemas, respectively. Table 1 shows the number of MSTs for each expert metaschema, corresponding to the number of STs marked by that expert with a minimum, maximum and average numbers of 12, 36 and about 26, respectively. The standard deviation is 10.23. We were interested in quantifying the variability of the experts\u2019 responses. Towards this end, we computed the X-by-X agreement matrix, among X experts, to examine the agreement between any two experts in the same study group. In the agreement matrix, the number in row i and column j indicates how many MSTs expert i and expert j agree on. The agreement matrix of all 11 experts (Table 2 ) demonstrates the high variability of participant responses. For instance, participants 2 and 5 both marked 34 STs and agreed on 27 of them. The average inter-participant agreement is 16.76 (only about 63% of the average number of marked STs, 26.73), with a high of 30 and a low of 6. The large range shows the high variability of participant responses. It was expected that some choices would be made by many participating experts. We were interested in metaschemas that represent a kind of aggregation of the experts\u2019 responses rather than in the expert metaschemas of the individuals. In particular, we constructed a sequence of cumulative metaschemas, each of which reflects a specific level of aggregation of the experts. Suppose we have X experts\u2019 responses. We define a threshold value N in the range (1, X) to represent the level of aggregation. We construct the cumulative metaschema for a given N as follows. For each ST marked by at least N participating experts, an MST is defined and given the name of the ST. Then meta-child-of\u2019s and meta-relationships are derived as described before. In our study, we received responses from 11 experts (X =11) and thus obtained 11 cumulative metaschemas by varying N over the range (1,11). For N =8, for example, the same 16 STs were marked by at least 8 out of the 11 experts, and so the corresponding cumulative metaschema has 16 MSTs. Table 3 shows the number of semantic types marked for each N. Obviously, the larger the value of N, the smaller the common number of MSTs. As we can see from Table 3, the number of MSTs varies from 2 (for N =11) to 45 (for N =1, 2 and 3). The corresponding metaschema for the N =11 case contains only two MSTs Entity and Event, each spanning the whole corresponding tree of the SN. For the N \u2a7d3 cases, each non-leaf ST names an MST. The metaschema that emerges in those cases is effectively just the SN itself, without its leaves. No real grouping of related STs occurs. Obviously such extreme metaschemas are not interesting. We denote the cumulative metaschema with the threshold value N representing a simple majority of the experts (i.e., N =\u2308X/2\u2309) as the consensus metaschema [31]. For the top-down study, the consensus metaschema (N =6) contains 26 MSTs. Its hierarchy is shown in Fig. 4 . We call this metaschema the top-down consensus metaschema. Nevertheless, we were not satisfied by this semantic metaschema as reflecting experts\u2019 opinions. The variations among the various experts\u2019 metaschemas were too wide. For example, there were no STs that all experts chose, except for the roots, Entity and Event which were dictated by the top-down approach. We note that in the study, the number of MSTs varied greatly. Also, important MSTs such as Molecular Sequence(4), which appears in the lexical metaschema, or Anatomical Abnormality(3), Animal(9), and Plant(2) which appear in the cohesive metaschema, are missing from the top-down consensus metaschema, although we expected them. One possible explanation for the large variations and the lack of expected MSTs is that the instructions we provided to the experts were deficient. The decision of choosing an ST to head a group is made without considering the group members (which are further down in the tree of SN) and thus were not scanned yet, in the top-down scanning. The decision is made solely based on comparing the current ST to its parent (P) and deciding whether it is too important and different from P to be in P\u2019s group. The exact instruction given was \u201cwhile scanning, marked by star semantic types which you judge as important and quite different from their parent semantic types\u201d. No further elaboration was given. In other words, the domain experts were asked to identify substantial or unusual shifts of granularity in the taxonomy of SN. The lower level of agreement seems to be caused by the need of the expert to make such decisions without full knowledge. By this we refer to the inherent problem of choosing the current ST to represent a group of descendant STs, without knowing who will be the members of the group since they were not scanned yet. Furthermore, although it is known that the group members are descendants of the current ST, it is not known which descendants, as some of them may be selected later for subsequent groups. This problem led us to consider an alternative approach, where the SN is scanned bottom-up and a decision regarding a root of a group is made by an expert considering the whole group as well as the comparison to its parent. This was expected to enable experts to create a better metaschema based on semantic considerations, as their decisions would be based on more knowledge. In the next section, we present the bottom-up approach. 3 Methods 3.1 Design of bottom-up heuristic metaschema 3.1.1 The bottom-up study In order to find a better way for validating algorithmically generated metaschemas, we conducted a bottom-up study with 13 participants. Instead of scanning the STs of SN from the roots to the leaves as in the top-down study, the participants in the bottom-up study were instructed to scan the two SN trees from the leaves up to the roots. The detailed instructions are as follows: 1. \u201cA leaf (semantic type without children) is not chosen to head a group. 2. When processing the current semantic type, consider to what extent the descendant semantic types of its group are more specific than its parent semantic type. If it is much more specific, then choose the current semantic type to head its group by marking it with a star. That means the parent will be in a separate group. Otherwise, the parent semantic type should be added to the group of the current semantic type. Remark: Although the marking is attached to the current semantic type, the decision is actually whether to include the parent in the same group. 3. The star marking of each participant will be used to define a metaschema, where each semantic type marked by a star names a metasemantic type. The metaschema will be compared with the results of other respondents and with our algorithmically derived metaschema\u201d. 3.1.2 Reliability of the experts We used reliability theory [32] to assess the variability of the experts in producing the bottom-up metaschema. When experts designate each ST as belonging or not belonging to a metaschema, their answers may reflect an idealized consensus opinion about which STs truly belong to it, or they may reflect error, noise, and differences of opinion. Cronbach\u2019s alpha [32] estimates the proportion of the total variability in the experts\u2019 answers that is due to true differences among STs (some do and some do not belong in the metaschema). The remainder of the variability (1\u2212Cronbach\u2019s alpha) represents the error, noise, and differences of opinion. Cronbach\u2019s alpha ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 represents pure noise and 1 represents perfect consensus among the experts. A value of .7 is often used as a target for reasonable reliability. In general, by combining the answers of several experts, one obtains a better and more reliable result. One can report the average per rater reliability, which measures the degree to which the average expert tends to agree with other experts, or one can report the reliability of the combined result, which will always be higher than the per rater estimate. For example, a metaschema produced by one expert will not be as good as one produced by the combined opinion of several experts (a consensus metaschema). Cronbach\u2019s alpha estimates the reliability of the combined result, but the per rater reliability can be calculated easily from it [32]. We calculated Cronbach\u2019s alpha for the bottom-up metaschema, treating each of the 45 candidate STs as expert tasks. We then compared the result to that of the top-down metaschema. These results appear in Section 4.1. 3.2 Comparing metaschemas In the comparison of two metaschemas, we consider not only the MST names, but also the underlying ST groups represented by the MSTs. To support the comparison, we present four definitions as follows. Let M A and M B be two metaschemas of the SN. Definition 1 Identical An MST A in M A is identical to an MST B in M B if both MSTs have the same underlying ST group. Since the ST group of an MST is connected and is part of the tree hierarchy of SN, this group is a tree. Since the root is used to name the MST of the group, both MSTs A and B share the same name. Definition 2 Similar An MST A in M A is similar to an MST B in M B if both MSTs have the same name and the same root. Again, the names are the same. This definition expresses that the names of two similar MSTs are equal. To better understand the differences between pairs of similar MSTs, we note that in some cases the difference reflects various levels of granularity in the partition, rather than major disagreements between the metaschemas. An MST in one metaschema may be split into several MSTs in the other metaschema. We now define \u201crefinement\u201d as follows. Let G M (A) denote the ST group represented by the MST A in the metaschema M. Definition 3 Refinement Let A be an MST in metaschema M A . If there exists a set of MSTs {B 1, B 2,\u2026, B k } (k \u2a7e2) in metaschema M B such that A and B 1 (which is the root of {B i }) are similar (that is, the STs A and B 1 are equal) and G M A (A) = \u222a i = 1 k G M B ( B i ) , then the set {B 1, B 2,\u2026, B k } is called a refinement of A. Definition 4 Refinable Two similar MSTs A in metaschema M A and B in the metaschema M B are called refinable if either A has a refinement in M B or B has a refinement in M A . Definition 5 Non-refinable Two similar MSTs A in the metaschema M A and B in the metaschema M B , neither of which has a refinement in the other metaschema, are called non-refinable. To illustrate these definitions, Fig. 5 demonstrates an abstract Semantic Network S of STs (Fig. 5a) and the two abstract metaschemas M A (Fig. 5b) and M B (Fig. 5c). A black shadow for two MSTs with identical names in the two metaschemas M A and M B indicates identical MSTs. For example, the ST set for MST S1 is {S1} for both M A and M B . Both MSTs S2 and S3 for the metaschemas M A and M B are similar. But their characteristics differ. The occurrences of S2 in both metaschemas define a refinement. More precisely, {S2(3),S5(2)} in M A is a refinement of S2(5) in M B , since the ST group of S2(5)={S2, S4, S6, S5, S9} is equal to the union S2(3)\u222aS5(2)={S2, S4, S6}\u222a{S5, S9}. The occurrences of S2 in both metaschemas are refinable. The occurrences of S3 in both metaschemas are non-refinable. We compare two metaschemas using the above three terms to measure the similarity between their ST coverages. To capture cases of either identical MSTs or MSTs which reflect only granularity differences between two metaschemas, we introduce another term, correspondable MSTs. Definition 6 Correspondable An MST A in M A is correspondable to an MST B in M B if A and B are either identical or refinable. Definition 7 Corresponding MST groups Two groups of MSTs in two metaschemas M A and M B , respectively, are corresponding MST groups if either both groups are singletons of identical MSTs or one group is a singleton and the other group is a refinement of the MST of the singleton. For example, in Fig. 5 there are two pairs of corresponding MST groups, shown by broken lines circumscribing them. They are the identical S1(1) in M A and S1(1) in M B and the groups S2(3)\u222aS5(2) in M A and S2(5) in M B of which the first is a refinement of the second. 3.3 Structural properties of metaschemas We will now list several structural metrics for characterizing a metaschema M. (1) Cardinality C: The number of MSTs in a metaschema. (2) Complexity: The ratio of the number of relationships (both hierarchical and semantic relationships) to the cardinality. For convenience we will refer to the number of STs represented by an MST M i , i =1,\u2026, C as the weight W(M i ) of the MST. (3) Maximum weight MAXW =max1\u2a7di\u2a7dC W(M i ). (4) Minimum weight MINW =min1\u2a7di\u2a7dC W(M i ). (5) Weight spread WS = MAXW \u2212 MINW. (6) Average weight AVGW = 1 C \u2211 i = 1 C W ( M i ) . (7) Standard deviation of the weights of the MSTs. \u03c3 = \u2211 i = 1 C ( W ( M i ) - AVGW ) 2 C . Note that the standard deviation\u2019s contribution of an MST M i , defined as SDC(M i )=(W(M i )\u2212 AVGW)2, is evaluated when comparing the standard deviations, since \u03c3 = \u2211 i = 1 C SDC ( M i ) C . (8) Coverage: Percentage of SN semantic relationships covered by the meta-relationships of the metaschema. This measure is based on [15,16] and will be used sparingly in this paper. From the structural point of view, in an ideal partition of n elements into k groups, each group will have an almost equal weight (WS is at most 1). Such a partition is called a uniform partition. However, if the elements are nodes of a tree and the partition is into connected subtrees, then due to the structure of the tree, a uniform partition is not always possible. Thus, as an approximation to a uniform partition, we are looking for a partition with a minimum weight spread. Other alternatives are a partition with a minimum heaviest weight (MIN\u2013MAX partition) or a partition with a maximum lightest weight (MAX\u2013MIN partition). For algorithms to construct a MAX\u2013MIN partition and a MIN\u2013MAX partition of a weighted tree, see [33,34]. Beyond the two extreme measures, MAXW and MINW, of the partition, we would like all its weights to be as close as possible to the average weight. For this purpose, we want the standard deviation of the weights to be as small as possible. Furthermore, the partition underlying a metaschema will probably not be uniform due to its need to capture different subject areas correctly. This is a much more important consideration than the equal size of the MST groups. Nevertheless, there are cases where one can choose between two options regarding the grouping, for which there is no clear-cut semantic reason to decide between them. In such a case, we should follow the structural criteria and prefer the option which tends to equalize the weights of the groups, avoiding groups which are too large or too small. 3.4 Consolidation We have developed an algorithm which takes two given metaschemas M A ={A 1, A 2,\u2026, A m } and M B ={B 1, B 2,\u2026, B n } for an abstract Semantic Network S as input, and generates an output M C , a consolidated metaschema. When constructing the consolidated metaschema, the algorithm attempts to minimize the MAXW and the weights\u2019 standard deviation, while maximizing the MINW for this metaschema. In doing this, the algorithm tries to improve the structural properties of the consolidated metaschema by choosing MSTs of the given metaschemas accordingly. In the process of the algorithm, we will construct a sequence of auxiliary Semantic Networks and auxiliary metaschemas derived from the original Semantic Network S and metaschemas M A and M B . In the description of the algorithm, we will use the previously defined terms: identical MSTs, similar MSTs, refinable MSTs, correspondable MSTs, non-refinable MSTs and corresponding MST groups. We will need a few more definitions. Definition 8 Auxiliary induced metaschema Given a metaschema M A defined for a Semantic Network S, an auxiliary induced metaschema M A \u2032 is obtained from M A by deleting some selected MSTs of M A or by combining some groups of MSTs of M A such that all the child-of in the original metaschema M A among MSTs of M A \u2032 exist in M A \u2032 . Definition 9 Expanded Semantic Network Let M A \u2032 be an auxiliary induced metaschema of the metaschema M A defined for Semantic Network S. The expanded Semantic Network S\u2032 of the metaschema M A \u2032 contains all the STs of all MSTs of M A \u2032 and all IS-A relationships in the original Semantic Network S among the STs of S\u2032. We note that S may consist of several connected components (as for the UMLS SN). In such a case the algorithm works independently on each component. The algorithm MAIN-CONSOLIDATE (M A , M B , S, M C ) takes two stages. It first invokes its core procedure R-CONSOLIDATE (M A , M B , S, M C ) to obtain an initial consolidated metaschema M C , and then further modifies M C to complete the consolidation. We will now present a high-level description of the algorithm MAIN-CONSOLIDATE (M A , M B , S, M C ), followed by a step-by-step description. The procedure R-CONSOLIDATE (M A , M B , S, M C ) is a recursive procedure to create a consolidated metaschema M C from two given metaschemas M A and M B of a Semantic Network S. The procedure starts by selecting all the identical MSTs of M A and M B for M C . It continues by selecting from each pair of corresponding MST groups of M A and M B , an MST or a group of MSTs, which minimizes the standard deviation contributions, to be added to M C . The identical MSTs and corresponding MST groups of both input metaschemas are deleted from M A and M B in such a way that auxiliary induced metaschemas M A \u2032 and M B \u2032 are generated. Next we create the expanded Semantic Network S\u2032 of M A \u2032 (and of M B \u2032 , which is identical). At this stage, all root MSTs of M A \u2032 and M B \u2032 are non-refinable. Let A i and B j be two similar root MSTs of M A \u2032 and M B \u2032 , respectively. We add to M C the one of A i and B j which minimizes the standard deviation contribution. Without loss of generality, assume that MST A i of M A \u2032 was selected for adding to M C . We derive the induced auxiliary metaschema M A \u2033 by removing MST A i from M A \u2032 . Next, we obtain the expanded Semantic Network S\u2033 from M A \u2033 . If M A \u2033 (and S\u2033) are empty, we return M C and the algorithm is finished. If M A \u2033 is not empty, we face a difficulty. We cannot obtain the auxiliary metaschema M B \u2033 from M B \u2032 by deleting A i , since A i is not an MST in M B \u2032 , neither does it have a refinement in M B \u2032 , since the MST A i of M A \u2032 is non-refinable. As a result, we will obtain M B \u2033 in an indirect way, following the derivation of several auxiliary induced metaschemas of M B \u2032 and their expanded Semantic Networks. First we obtain the auxiliary induced metaschema M B \u2217 from M B \u2032 which will include all the MSTs of M B \u2032 for which all their STs are in S\u2033. The expanded Semantic Network S\u2217 of M B \u2217 is derived. The Semantic Network D is derived by deleting from S\u2032 all the STs of S\u2217. Next, we derive an auxiliary induced metaschema SD for the Semantic Network D consisting of the connected components of D. Each component is represented by one MST, named after the root. Finally, we derive the desired auxiliary induced metaschema M B \u2033 by combining the metaschemas M B \u2217 and SD. At this stage, we are ready for a recursive call of the procedure R-CONSOLIDATE ( M A \u2033 , M B \u2033 , S\u2033, M C ), to update the metaschema M C . After receiving the updated M C , we return it as a partial result. If M C contains an MST of one ST, with at most one child, it is added to its parent MST. We will now describe this algorithm as a series of separate steps. To keep track of this fairly complicated process, we provide in Fig. 6 a diagram, which reflects the process described in R-CONSOLIDATE and the reader may use it as a road map. The procedure\u2019s steps are labeled by numbers. By necessity some of the numbers occur twice in the diagram, because they describe operations with two inputs or because the described operation may occur for either one of the two input metaschemas. Following the step-by-step algorithm description, there is an example. The reader is advised to review the example in parallel to reading the algorithm. Procedure R-CONSOLIDATE (M A , M B , S, M C ) Step 1: All MSTs that are identical (as defined above) in both input metaschemas M A , M B are included in the output metaschema M C . Step 2: When given an ST in one input metaschema and its refinement in the other input metaschema, for example, the set {B 1, B 2,\u2026, B k } with a refinement of A j , then if \u2211 i = 1 k SDC ( B i ) < SDC ( A j ) , include the set {B 1, B 2,\u2026, B k } in the output metaschema M C . Otherwise, include A j in M C . The same rule applies to an MST B l with a refinement {A 1, A 2,\u2026, A m }. We note that in case of different cardinalities for M A and M B we use the average of the two cardinalities for calculating the contribution to the standard deviation. Step 3: We construct two auxiliary induced metaschemas M A \u2032 ( M B \u2032 ) from M A (M B ) by removing from M A (M B ) all corresponding MST groups (identified in the two previous steps). Step 4: We construct an expanded Semantic Network S\u2032 of M A \u2032 and the given Semantic Network S. Step 5: Choosing from non-refinable similar root MSTs A i and B j (in M A \u2032 and M B \u2032 , respectively), (i) if SDC(A i )< SDC(B j ), include A i in the consolidated metaschema M C . Otherwise, (ii) include B j in M C . If there are several roots, such a choice is made for each root. Step 6: Assuming without loss of generality that A i of M A \u2032 was selected (case (i)), we construct an auxiliary induced metaschema M A \u2033 from M A \u2032 by removing from M A \u2032 the root MST A i . If M A \u2033 is empty then return. Note that, if B j was selected for case (ii), the respective role reversal of M A \u2032 and M B \u2032 would follow. Step 7: We construct an expanded Semantic Network S\u2033 of M A \u2033 and the Semantic Network S\u2032. Step 8: We construct an auxiliary induced metaschema M B \u2217 from M B \u2032 as follows. Only those MSTs (from M B \u2032 ) which have all their semantic types in S\u2033 are included in M B \u2217 . Step 9: We construct an expanded Semantic Network S\u2217 of M B \u2217 and the Semantic Network S\u2033. Step 10: We construct the difference D of S\u2033 and S\u2217 as follows. D contains all the STs of S\u2033 which are not in S\u2217, i.e., we use traditional set difference. Step 11: We construct an auxiliary induced metaschema SD, which consists of the maximally connected components of D, with each component corresponding to one MST, named after its root. Step 12: We construct the auxiliary induced metaschema M B \u2033 as follows. We combine SD with M B \u2217 using appropriate meta-child-of relationships from the MSTs of M B \u2217 up to the MSTs of SD. Step 13: If the metaschemas M A \u2033 and M B \u2033 consist of one connected component then recursively call R-CONSOLIDATE ( M A \u2033 , M B \u2033 , S\u2033, M C ). Otherwise, recursively call R-CONSOLIDATE for every pair of connected components ( M A i \u2033 , M B j \u2033 ), such that M A i \u2033 and M B j \u2033 have similar MST roots, A i and B j , with their corresponding expanded Semantic Network. Return the partially consolidated metaschema M C . END Procedure R-CONSOLIDATE Algorithm MAIN-CONSOLIDATE (M A , M B , S, M C ) Stage 1: Invoke R-CONSOLIDATE (M A , M B , S, M C ). Stage 2: (Modification): Each MST in M C with only one ST (such MSTs are called singletons) is combined with its parent MST whenever this child MST is a leaf or has a single child in M C . Return the completely consolidated metaschema M C . END Algorithm MAIN-CONSOLIDATE 3.4.1 Example We demonstrate the MAIN-CONSOLIDATE (M A , M B , S, M C ) algorithm for M A , M B and S given in Fig. 5. The algorithm first invokes procedure R-CONSOLIDATE, passing M A , M B , S and M C as arguments. The following Steps 1\u201313 show the process of R-CONSOLIDATE. Step 1: S1 is an identical MST in M A and M B and is included in M C (Fig. 7 a\u2013c). There are 19 STs in the abstract Semantic Network S, and 5 MSTs in both M A and M B . Thus, the average MST\u2019s weight for both metaschemas is 3.8, which is used for computing the SDC. Step 2: S2(5) in M B (Fig. 7b) contributes 1.44 to the standard deviation, while its refinement {S2(3),S5(2)} in M A (Fig. 7a) contributes 0.64+3.24=3.88. In this case, S2(5) of M B is chosen for M C (Fig. 7c). Step 3: S1(1), S2(3) and S5(2) are removed from M A to yield M A \u2032 . S1(1) and S2(5) are removed from M B to yield M B \u2032 (Fig. 7d and e). Step 4: We construct S\u2032 by expanding of S3(3) and S10(10) of M A \u2032 (Fig. 7f). Step 5: For our example, S3(3) in M A \u2032 (Fig. 7d), which contributes 0.64 to the standard deviation, is chosen, rather than S3(8), in M B \u2032 (Fig. 7e), which contributes 17.64. Step 6: The MST S3(3) of M A \u2032 is deleted as is indicated in Fig. 8 a by dotted lines, to obtain M A \u2033 as shown in Fig. 8d. Step 7: S\u2033 is generated by reexpanding M A \u2033 , which has one MST S10(10) (see Fig. 8e). Step 8: For M B \u2032 of Fig. 9 a and S\u2033 of Fig. 9b, M B \u2217 = { S 14 ( 2 ) , S 16 ( 3 ) } , see Fig. 9c. S3(8) is not included in M B \u2217 , because S3 is not in S\u2033. Step 9: We expand M B \u2217 to get S\u2217. For the M B \u2217 of Fig. 9c, S\u2217 is shown in Fig. 9d. Step 10: D is constructed by removing S14(2) and S16(3) from S\u2033 (Fig. 9e). Step 11: As there is only one component, the induced auxiliary metaschema SD consists of S10(5) only (Fig. 9f). Step 12: S10(5) is combined with S14(2) and S16(3) into M B \u2033 (Fig. 9g). We note that the MST S10(5) was not an MST in the original M B metaschema. What have we achieved now? M B \u2033 is a metaschema for S\u2033. M A \u2033 has been a metaschema of S\u2033 all along. Most importantly, neither M A \u2033 nor M B \u2033 represent any semantic types which are represented by the MSTs in M C . Thus, we have extended the output metaschema, while the two input metaschemas have been shrunk correctly, and they correctly summarize their corresponding \u201cshrunk\u201d Semantic Network. Step 13: The MST group S10(5), S14(2), S16(3) of M B \u2033 , in Fig. 9g, is the refinement of S10(10) of M A \u2033 in Fig. 8d. In this case the refinement in M B \u2033 has a lower standard deviation contribution than S10(10) and is chosen for the consolidated metaschema. After the deletion of the corresponding MSTs, the resulting metaschemas are empty and the procedure returns. At this point, the M C is a partially consolidated metaschema and the first stage of the MAIN-CONSOLIDATE algorithm is done. At the second stage, we see S1(1) is a singleton MST, but it has two children, thus it is legitimate and no modification occurs. The consolidated metaschema M C for the given metaschemas M A and M B for the abstract Semantic Network S is shown in Fig. 10 . 4 Results 4.1 Bottom-up heuristic metaschema In the bottom-up study, we received responses from 13 experts. Individual participants\u2019 responses varied both in the choice of STs marked and their numbers. For example, experts 1 and 3 chose 28 and 17 STs, respectively, to name MSTs in their expert metaschemas. Table 4 shows the number of MSTs for each expert metaschema, corresponding to the number of STs marked by that expert. The average number of MSTs marked is 23, with minimum and maximum numbers of 16 and 30, respectively. The standard deviation is 4.56. Each expert\u2019s response can be used to construct one expert\u2019s metaschema. We obtained 13 cumulative metaschemas, from the 13 experts\u2019 (X =13) metaschemas, by varying N over the range (1,13). In the Nth cumulative metaschema, N =1,\u2026,13, each MST was chosen by at least N experts. For N =8, for example, there were 16 STs marked by at least 8 out of the 13 experts, and so the corresponding cumulative metaschema has 16 MSTs. Table 5 shows the number of STs marked for each N. As we can see from the table, the number of MSTs varies from 3 (for N =13) to 41 (for N =1 and 2). Obviously such extreme metaschemas are not interesting. The consensus metaschema (N =7) contains 25 MSTs. Its hierarchy is shown in Fig. 11 . We observed that in the bottom-up study too, individual participants\u2019 responses varied greatly, both in the choice of STs marked and their numbers. To substantiate this, we constructed the agreement matrix of all 13 experts (Table 6 ) that demonstrates the agreement as well as the high variability of participant responses. For instance, participants 1 and 4 marked 28 and 25 STs, respectively, and agreed on only 16 of them. The average inter-participant agreement is 14.41 (only 67% of the average number of 23 marked STs), with a high of 25 and a low of 6. Cronbach\u2019s alpha for the consensus bottom-up metaschema was .79. This implies that the consensus metaschema is sufficiently reliable (greater than .7; see Section 3.1.2). For the consensus top-down metaschema, Cronbach\u2019s alpha was .62, which is lower than the threshold, but still reasonable. By looking at the per rater reliability, one can correct for the fact that the bottom-up metaschema had more experts than the top-down one. The per rater reliability for the bottom-up metaschema was .23, and for the top-down metaschema it was .13. The difference was borderline (p =.053). These results imply that a metaschema produced by a single expert by either method is insufficiently reliable (i.e., both are well below .7) and that the bottom-up approach is probably more reliable than the top-down approach, although the difference did not quite achieve statistical significance. Another way to understand the results is to ask how many experts\u2019 answers would need to be combined to achieve the target reliability of .7. The bottom-up approach would require 8 experts on average, whereas the top-down approach would require 16. 4.2 Results of metaschema comparison To facilitate the comparison between the consensus metaschemas obtained from the two studies, we show both their hierarchies in Fig. 12 . MSTs identical in both metaschemas are indicated by black shadows. Similar MSTs are denoted by gray shadow. There are 12 MSTs identical for the two metaschemas. For example Pathological Function(6) is an MST in both metaschemas, representing the same underlying ST group. Table 7 lists all the identical MSTs and their sizes. Hence, both metaschemas agree that these 12 MSTs represent important subject areas in the SN. Altogether, they cover 47 STs (i.e., 34.8% of the SN). There are seven similar MSTs. For example, Biological Function(8) in the top-down study metaschema is similar to Biological Function(1) in the bottom-up metaschema. Table 8 shows these similar MSTs along with their sizes in each of the two metaschemas. In the top-down study metaschema, these seven MSTs cover 60 STs, which is about 44% of the SN. In the bottom-up study metaschema, these seven MSTs cover 38 STs, which is about 28%. To better understand the nature of the similarity represented in Table 8, we will explore refinements in both directions. As a refinement of the top-down consensus metaschema, consider the MST Organism(15) in the top-down consensus metaschema. This MST is split into two separate MSTs, Organism(6), and Animal(9), in the bottom-up consensus metaschema. In other words, {Organism(6), Animal(9)} in the bottom-up consensus metaschema is a refinement of Organism(15) in the top-down consensus metaschema. The refinement cases cover 42 STs in both metaschemas. Table 9 lists the cases of refinement of the top-down consensus metaschema. Considering refinements in the other direction of the bottom-up consensus metaschema, there is one case. {Activity(6), Research Activity(2)} in the top-down study metaschema is the refinement of Activity(8) in the bottom-up study metaschema. 4.3 Results of structural evaluation In Table 10 , we show the values of the eight structural measures for both the consensus metaschemas. For example, the top-down consensus metaschema has the cardinality 26, while the bottom-up consensus metaschema has the cardinality 25. Table 11 shows the distribution of the weights for both metaschemas. For example, both metaschemas contain three MSTs of weight six. Here, weight six means there are six STs in the group represented by the MST. 4.4 Consolidated metaschema Following the MAIN-CONSOLIDATE algorithm (see Section 3.4), we may derive a consolidated metaschema of the two consensus metaschemas as follows. Steps 1\u201313 show the process of the R-CONSOLIDATE procedure. 4.4.1 Step 1 All identical 12 MSTs in both metaschemas (marked with black shadows in Fig. 12) are included in the consolidated metaschema. 4.4.2 Step 2 We selected the MST or its refinement whichever minimizes the SDC. The two consensus metaschemas have different cardinalities, 25 and 26. Thus, in calculating the contribution to the standard deviation, the average 25.5 of the two cardinalities is used. For example, on one hand, Biological Function(8) in the top-down consensus metaschema contributes to the standard deviation 7.3, while the refinement {Biological Function(1), Physiological Function(7)} in the bottom-up consensus metaschema contributes 21.4. In this case, Biological Function (8) is selected for the consolidated metaschema. On the other hand, Organism(15) in the top-down consensus metaschema contributes 94.1, but its refinement in the bottom-up metaschema {Organism(6), Animal(9)} only contributes 14.2. This refinement is selected for the consolidated metaschema. The corresponding MSTs are marked either by black shadows for identical MSTs or are marked with dashed borders for similar MSTs with refinements (see Fig. 13 a and b). Fig. 14 shows the partial consolidated metaschema after selecting corresponding MSTs, where the MST corresponding groups selected for the consolidated metaschema to minimize the SDC, are circumscribed by broken lines. 4.4.3 Step 3 We construct two auxiliary metaschemas M A \u2032 and M B \u2032 by deleting from M A and M B the identical MSTs and the corresponding MST groups, as shown in Fig. 15 a and b. 4.4.4 Step 4 An expanded Semantic Network SN\u2032 is derived using all STs summarized by all MSTs of M A \u2032 together with the IS-A relationships directed to them in SN. Fig. 15c shows SN\u2032, which consists of two subtrees, one rooted at Substance and the other at Entity. Each of the two auxiliary metaschemas M A \u2032 and M B \u2032 is a metaschema of SN\u2032. The consolidation of each of the subtrees is now described independently. We note that at this stage the Event portion of the consolidated metaschema is fully determined. 4.4.5 Step 5 for Substance For the subtree of SN\u2032 rooted at Substance (Fig. 15c), based on the SDC, Substance(3) in the bottom-up metaschema M B \u2032 is chosen, rather than Substance(11) in the top-down metaschema M A \u2032 . 4.4.6 Step 6 for Chemical Since Substance(3) in the bottom-up metaschema is selected for the consolidated metaschema, an auxiliary induced metaschema M A \u2033 is obtained, which contains only one MST, Chemical(18). 4.4.7 Step 7 for Chemical SN\u2033 is the expanded Semantic Network for M A \u2033 . For brevity, we will omit figures for some steps. 4.4.8 Step 8 for Substance Since Substance(3) is not an MST of the top-down metaschema, M B \u2217 needs to be constructed from M B \u2032 in order to obtain M B \u2033 . M B \u2217 contains the MSTs from M B \u2032 which have all their STs in SN\u2033, in this case, Pharmacologic Substance(2) and Organic Chemical(8). 4.4.9 Step 9 for Pharmacologic Substance and Organic Chemical We construct an expanded Semantic Network SN\u2217 from the metaschema M B \u2217 . 4.4.10 Step 10 for Chemical The difference D of SN\u2033 and SN\u2217 is constructed. 4.4.11 Step 11 for Chemical The SD now consists of Chemical(8) obtained from the grouping of the STs which are contained in D. 4.4.12 Step 12 for Chemical Once M B \u2217 and SD are obtained, M B \u2033 can be derived. It contains all MSTs from SD and M B \u2217 , Chemical(8), Pharmacologic Substance(2) and Organic Chemical(8), as well as the meta-child-of relationships from the last two MSTs to Chemical(8). 4.4.13 Step 13 for Chemical Comparing M A \u2033 , which consists of Chemical(18), of the bottom-up metaschema and M B \u2033 , consisting of Chemical(8), Pharmacologic Substance(2) and Organic Chemical(8), we see that this is a case of similar MSTs with a refinement. This situation is handled as discussed in Step 3. The refinement {Chemical(8), Pharmacologic Substance(2), Organic Chemical(8)} is selected for the consolidated metaschema rather than Chemical(18) because it contributes less to the standard deviation, compared to Chemical(18). Note that the only MST of the consolidated metaschema (of the Substance component) which is not an MST of a given metaschema is Chemical(8). 4.4.14 Step 5 for Entity For the subtree rooted at Entity, Entity(1) is less expensive than Entity(14) (see Fig. 16 ), in terms of the standard deviation contribution. Therefore Entity(1) in the top-down metaschema is chosen (see Fig. 16a). 4.4.15 Step 6 for Entity Entity(1) will be removed from the top-down metaschema together with the two meta-child-of relationships directed to it, as shown in Fig. 16a. An M A \u2033 , which is {Physical Object(1), Conceptual Entity(5), Intellectual Product(3), Idea or Concept(6)} (Fig. 17 a), is obtained as a result of the deletion. The metaschema M A \u2033 consists of two disconnected MST subtrees, one rooted at Physical Object(1) and the other at Conceptual Entity(3). 4.4.16 Step 7 for Physical Object and Conceptual Entity The expanded Semantic Network SN\u2033 constructed from M A \u2033 , consists of two subtrees rooted at Physical Object and Conceptual Entity, respectively (Fig. 17b). 4.4.17 Summary of Steps 8\u201313 Since Entity(1) is not an MST of the bottom-up metaschema, an M B \u2217 needs to be derived, which consists of Organism Attributes(2) only (see Fig. 17c). The Semantic Network SN\u2217 constructed from M B \u2217 includes Organism Attribute and Clinical Attribute (Fig. 17d). We can then obtain SD as {Physical Object(1), Conceptual Entity(12)} as a grouping of the difference D of SN\u2033 and SN\u2217 into maximally connected components (Fig. 17e). The resulting M B \u2033 combining M B \u2217 and SD and all meta-child-of links connecting them is therefore {Physical Object(1), Conceptual Entity(12), Organism Attribute(2)} (Fig. 17f). Since M A \u2033 and M B \u2033 are not empty, we apply the R-CONSOLIDATE procedure recursively to the M A \u2033 of the top-down metaschema and the M B \u2033 of the bottom-up metaschema and their common Semantic Network SN\u2033. For space reasons, we omit the details of this recursive call. 4.4.18 Obtaining completely consolidated metaschema M C In the modification stage of the MAIN-CONSOLIDATE algorithm, we scan the entire consolidated metaschema, looking for singleton MSTs which are not branching points in the metaschema. We see that the singleton MST Physical Object(1) is not a branching point in the metaschema. Therefore, Physical Object(1) is merged with its parent Entity(1) to create the MST Entity(2). The MST Manufactured Object(5) which was meta-child-of Physical Object(1), is now meta-child-of Entity(2). 4.5 Final consolidated metaschema The consolidated metaschema is shown in Fig. 18 . There are 28 MSTs in the consolidated metaschema. Twelve MSTs come from the identical MSTs in the two original consensus metaschemas. Eight MSTs are taken from cases of the refinements, seven of which come from the bottom-up consensus metaschema. Only Biological Function(8) comes from the top-down consensus metaschema. The remaining 8 MSTs come from the two subtrees rooted in non-refinable similar MSTs, namely Entity and Substance. Among those 8 MSTs, Conceptual Entity(5), Intellectual Product(3), Idea or Concept(6), Organic Chemical(8) and Pharmacologic Substance(2) are from the top-down consensus metaschema, while only Substance(3) is from the bottom-up consensus metaschema. Entity(2) and Chemical(8) are the only two MSTs, of the consolidated metaschema which do not appear as MSTs in the top-down or bottom-up metaschemas. They are still similar to MSTs, in the two given metaschemas, respectively, but with different groups. The structural properties of the consolidated metaschema will be compared to those of the consensus metaschemas in Section 5. We now turn our attention to non-IS-A, i.e., associative relationships. An occurrence of an associative relationship at an MST is called an introduction occurrence for this kind of relationship if this kind of relationship is not defined for the parent of this MST. We note that the same kind of relationship, e.g. \u201cissue in\u201d may have several introduction occurrences at several MSTs, none of which is an ancestor of another. All other occurrences of this kind of relationship are inherited from some introduction occurrence of this kind of relationships. The complete presentation of the consolidated metaschema including the introduction occurrences of associative (semantic) relationships appears in Fig. 19 . For space reasons, we had to code each relationship name as a number (see Table 12 ). The inherited relationships are omitted from Fig. 19 to reduce its graphical complexity, as they can be deduced due to the inheritance. However, the inherited associative relationships are taken into account in calculating the complexity of the metaschema (see Section 5). 5 Discussion The purpose of our research was to obtain a high quality metaschema. As discussed in the background section, the motivation for conducting the bottom-up metaschema study came from our dissatisfaction with the large variations in the top-down experts\u2019 metaschemas. We hoped that the bottom-up heuristics would lead experts to produce metaschemas with less variability and higher agreement due to the higher amount of data considered in the bottom-up process compared with the top-down approach. The results indeed show lower variations among the experts (Table 13 ). Note that although the average inter-participant agreement is higher for the top-down study (16.76 vs. 14.41), this is misleading due to larger cardinalities for the top-down study. When the average agreement is measured relative to the average cardinality (26.73 vs. 23), the higher proportion of agreement is obtained for the bottom-up study (0.67 vs. 0.63). Although the variability of the experts\u2019 metaschemas is lower in the bottom-up study than in the top-down study, it is still quite high. The large range shows the high variability of participant responses. Thus, there is a problem when using any individual expert\u2019s metaschema to evaluate an algorithmically derived metaschema, as experts vary so much in their opinions (Section 2). It seems that one cannot rely on any one expert to provide an authoritative metaschema for SN. At first this sounds quite disappointing. However, this phenomenon is understandable when one realizes that there is an exponential number of connected partitions for the SN, each of which would lead to a different metaschema. Furthermore, the experts are asked to make choices of importance and distinctions which are subjective and are influenced by their experience, background, specialty and personal preferences. Therefore we derived the consensus metaschemas for both studies, to overcome the variability of the individual experts\u2019 metaschemas. The two consensus metaschemas, the top-down metaschema and the bottom-up metaschema, reflect human considerations, since they are metaschemas resulting from several human experts\u2019 input. At the same time, their cumulative nature helped to overcome the variability mentioned above. However, as their evaluations show, each of them has pros and cons, in term of its structural properties. Thus, we constructed the consolidated metaschema that can best facilitate user orientation into the SN, by enjoying the advantages of each of the consensus metaschemas and avoiding their disadvantages. Altogether, in the consolidated metaschema, the groups identical to both input metaschemas contain 48 (36%) STs, the groups identical only to those in the bottom-up consensus metaschema contain 45 (33%) STs and the groups identical only to the top-down consensus metaschema contain 32 (24%) STs. Only 10 (7%) STs are contained in MSTs which did not appear in the given metaschemas, although they are similar to such MSTs (according to the definition of similar MSTs in Section 3.2). Hence, in the consolidated metaschema, 93% of the STs from the SN appear in MSTs selected by human experts. In [10], McCray et al. define the naturalness property of a partition of the SN as the condition that \u201cthe groups must characterize the domain in a way that is acceptable to a domain expert.\u201d As we saw, all MSTs except for two satisfy the naturalness property, as required for a partition of the SN by McCray et al. [10]. From the semantic viewpoint, we can see that important MSTs, missing in either of the consensus metaschemas but occurring in the other, are now in the consolidated metaschema. For example Molecular Sequence(4), Anatomical Abnormality(3) and Animal(9) are missing from the top-down consensus metaschema. Similarly, Organic Chemical(8), Intellectual Product(3), Idea or Concept(6), Pharmacologic Substance(2) and Conceptual Entity(5) are missing from the bottom-up consensus metaschema. All these MSTs appear in the consolidated metaschema. In addition, the consolidated metaschema shows better structural properties than either of the input metaschema (see Table 14 ). In particular, the consolidated metaschema has a lower weight range and a lower standard deviation. There were no statistically significant differences of the average weights among the top-down, bottom-up and consolidated metaschemas. By an F test for equality of variance [35], the standard deviations of the top-down and bottom-up metaschemas did not differ, but both were greater than that of the consolidated metaschema (p <.05). Using a bootstrap estimator [36], the maximum weight of the top-down metaschema was determined to be statistically significantly greater than that of the consolidated metaschema, but the other differences among the maxima did not achieve statistical significance. As can be seen, the bottom-up consensus metaschema contributed more of its groups to the consolidated metaschema than the top-down metaschema. On one hand, this is in line with the bottom-up study being based on providing the experts with more data and the lower variability of this study. On the other hand, this is surprising in view of (Table 13) better structural measures of the top-down consensus metaschema with regard to maximum weight and standard deviation. However, as mentioned before, these differences are not statistically significant. In spite of the much lower variability of the bottom-up experts\u2019 metaschemas, the advantage of the bottom-up study disappeared when we obtained the consensus metaschemas. We attribute this phenomenon to the largest MST, Chemical(18) in the bottom-up consensus metaschema. Working bottom-up, most of the experts did not identify any ST in the group Chemical(18), while experts scanning the SN top-down, identified Organic Chemical(8) and Pharmacologic Substance(2). This largest weight contributed much more to the weight range and standard deviation than the largest MST Organism(15) in the top-down consensus metaschema. However, this does not imply better quality of the top-down consensus metaschema for the other MSTs. Interestingly, the MAIN-CONSOLIDATE algorithm avoided selecting any large MSTs, and instead chose smaller natural MSTs covering the STs of the large MSTs in the other metaschema. 6 Conclusions In this paper, we compared, from a structural point of view, two heuristic metaschemas, the top-down and bottom-up consensus metaschemas, derived from two studies involving two groups of UMLS experts. We defined different levels of similarity. Using these definitions, we found that both heuristic metaschemas agree in almost half (12) of the MSTs. There are seven similar MSTs, five of which are cases of refinement. We defined several structural properties of a metaschema, such as, cardinality, complexity, maximum weight, minimum weight, weight spread, average weight, standard deviation and coverage percentage. We used them for evaluation of both consensus metaschemas. Second, we designed an algorithm to construct a consolidated metaschema from two given metaschemas, enjoying the advantages and avoiding the disadvantages of both. The consolidated metaschema has better structural properties, such as lower weight range as well as lower standard deviation than its inputs. It can better serve as an abstract network and support user orientation and navigation of the Semantic Network, due to its naturalness in identifying many groups selected by most experts in either of the studies. Furthermore, the relative structural uniformity of the consolidated metaschema, as expressed in the low weight range and standard deviation, will also support user orientation and navigation when accessing the underlying ST groups using various SN graphical views described in [12,15]. In previous research we had derived algorithmically generated metaschemas. The consolidated metaschema, being a digest of many domain experts\u2019 input, can be used to evaluate the naturalness of the algorithmic cohesive [12] and lexical [15] metaschemas, rather than the top-down consensus metaschema used for their evaluation in [12] and [16], respectively.
