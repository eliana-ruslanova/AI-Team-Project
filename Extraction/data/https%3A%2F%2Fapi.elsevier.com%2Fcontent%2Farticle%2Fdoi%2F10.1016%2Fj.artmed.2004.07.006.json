During diagnosis it can make a substantial difference to know the temporal order in which some symptoms occurred or for how long they lasted. During prognosis the potential evolutions of a disease are conceived as a description of events unfolding in time. In therapy planning the different steps of treatment must be applied in a precise order, with a given frequency and for a certain span of time in order to be effective. This article offers a survey on the use of temporal reasoning for decision support-related tasks in medicine.\n               \n               \n                  Material and methods:\n                  Key publications of the area, mainly circumscribed to the latest two decades, are reviewed and classified according to three important stages of patient treatment requiring decision support: diagnosis, prognosis and therapy planning/management. Other complementary publications, like those on time-centered information storage and retrieval, are also considered as they provide valuable support to the above mentioned three stages.\n               \n               \n                  Results:\n                  Key areas are highlighted and used to organize the latest contributions. The survey of previous research is followed by an analysis of what can still be improved and what is needed to make the next generation of decision support systems for medicine more effective.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions:\n                  It can be observed that although the area has been considerably developed, there are still areas where more research is needed to make time-based systems of widespread use in decision support-related areas of medicine. Several suggestions for further exploration are proposed as a result of the survey.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Temporal reasoning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Decision support for medicine"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Diagnosis"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Prognosis"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Therapy planning"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S093336570400106X", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S093336570400106X", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "11144288633", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-11144288633", "pubmed-id": "15617978", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/11144288633", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20041207", "$": "2004-12-07"}}}}}
