We represent an animal group with a set of finite-sized particles and vary known features of the group structure and motion via a class of generative models to position each particle on a two-dimensional plane. Particle positions are then mapped onto training images that are processed to emphasize the features of interest and match attainable far-field videos of real animal groups. The training images serve as templates of recognizable patterns of collective behavior and are compactly represented in a low-dimensional space called embedding manifold. Two mappings from the manifold are derived: the manifold-to-image mapping serves to reconstruct new and unseen images of the group and the manifold-to-feature mapping allows frame-by-frame classification of raw video. We validate the combined framework on datasets of growing level of complexity. Specifically, we classify artificial images from the generative model, interacting self-propelled particle model, and raw overhead videos of schooling fish obtained from the literature.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Classification"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Collective motion"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Fish schooling"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Generative modeling"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Isomap"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519313003706", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519313003706", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84884597344", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84884597344", "pubmed-id": "23933104", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84884597344", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20130809", "$": "2013-08-09"}}}}}
