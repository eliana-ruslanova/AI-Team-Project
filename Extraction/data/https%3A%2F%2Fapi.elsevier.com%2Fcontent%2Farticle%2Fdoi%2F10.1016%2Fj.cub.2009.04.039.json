Bernard Dixon reports. Main Text Long ago, when I was PhD student, my tasks were to formulate hypotheses about the metabolism of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, design and carry out experiments to test those hypotheses, interpret the results and then decide what experiments to conduct next. Now Ross King and colleagues at the universities of Aberystwyth and Cambridge say that all of this can be done by a robot called Adam. The paper describing Adam's first public performance (Science (2009) 324, 85) is entitled \u2018The Automation of Science\u2019. The fortuitous announcement of the work in the very week when Honda's robot ASIMO was touring the UK both enhanced and distorted media interest. The Times, for example, carried a report on Adam with an exaggerated headline (\u201cRobot scientist gets the job done after humans toil in vain\u201d) and a photograph of ASIMO conducting a symphony orchestra. This and other coverage conjured up science-fictional images of robot researchers marching into their laboratories in the morning. The reality is less dramatic, though undoubtedly impressive. Based on hardware automating the high-throughput execution of individually designed batch culture experiments in microtitre plates, Adam measures the growth curves of selected microbial strains in defined media. Ross King and his co-humans set him/it the task of identifying the genes for orphan enzymes in S. cerevisiae \u2014 those catalysing biochemical reactions known to occur in the yeast but whose genes have remained unidentified over several decades of research. Adam was able to hypothesise that three genes code for 2-aminoadipate:2-oxoglutarate amino-transferase (2A2OA), and obtained results consistent with all three hypotheses. \u201cWe accept that the knowledge automatically generated by Adam is of a modest kind,\u201d the authors write. \u201cHowever, this knowledge is not trivial and in the case of the genes encoding 2A2OA, it sheds light on, and perhaps solves, a 50-year-old puzzle.\u201d The fortuitous announcement of the work in the very week when Honda's robot ASIMO was touring the UK both enhanced and distorted media interest Those conclusions are more cautious than the headline to The Times story, which explained that Adam's work was likely to play an important role in developing new treatments for fungal diseases such as athlete's foot. \u201cFungi have a different mechanism from that of animals to produce lysine,\u201d the reporter explained, \u201cso if a drug can be developed that can disable the gene, it should be possible to treat people for fungal diseases without affecting their ability to make lysine\u201d. The writer was presumably unaware that lysine is one of the nine essential amino acids, so named because the human body cannot make them. Boost: Adam got more profile as Honda's ASIMO robot was on show in the UK at the time. (Photo: Jae C. Hong/AP/PA Photos.) The Independent's headline was one of several that skirted around scientific and philosophical caveats by announcing: \u201cRobot scientists can think for themselves.\u201d Adam was able, the story ran, to formulate theories and discover scientific knowledge on his own, marking a major advance in the field of artificial intelligence. \u201cSuch robo-scientists could be put to work unravelling complex biological systems, designing new drugs, modelling the world's climate or understanding the cosmos.\u201d Science itself was rather cool in introducing the paper and another in which a Cornell University group revealed \u201can algorithm that substitutes a combination of brute force and mathematical strategies to solve a problem that challenges human reasoning\u201d. It began with one question mark (\u201cIntelligent Machines?\u201d) and continued with another: \u201cHow can we make sense out of the enormous volume of scientific data that is now being generated, and would a robot be able to replace a research assistant, postdoc or even the principal investigator in a biological laboratory?\u201d Without any way minimising the achievement, the Financial Times, under the heading \u201cRobot achieves scientific first\u201d, was the only newspaper to hint at the variety and depth of assistance Adam received from his/its human collaborators. \u201cThe researchers endowed Adam with a huge database of yeast biology, automated hardware to carry out experiments, supplies of yeast cells and lab chemicals and powerful artificial intelligence software,\u201d Clive Cookson wrote. \u201cAlthough they did not intervene directly in Adam's experiments, they did stand by to fix technical glitches, add chemicals and remove waste.\u201d The outcome was a series of \u201csimple but useful\u201d discoveries, confirmed by scientists, about genes for certain yeast enzymes. Unsurprisingly, none of the reports explained that Adam had to be fed with a comprehensive logical model encoding knowledge of yeast metabolism, a bioinformatic database of genes and proteins, software to adduce hypotheses about genes for orphan enzymes, software to deduce experiments to test the observational consequences of the hypotheses, software to design and plan experiments, laboratory automation software to execute the experiments and record the data, software to analyse the data and metadata, and software to relate the analysed data to the hypotheses, including statistical methods to decide on significance. BBC News Channel website added an important rider, a comment from an independent expert that Adam was \u201cmore like a junior lab assistant than a scientist\u201d. But it also pointed out that King and his team are now developing a more advanced robot, Eve, to help in drug discovery.
