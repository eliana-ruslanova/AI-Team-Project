With the goal of establishing a baseline upon which to build educational activities on this topic, a survey was conducted among trainees and attending radiologists at a single residency program.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  An anonymous questionnaire was distributed. Comparisons of categorical data between groups (trainees and attending radiologists) were made using Pearson \u03c72 analysis or an exact analysis when required. Comparisons were made using the Wilcoxon rank sum test when the data were not normally distributed. An \u03b1 level of 0.05 was used.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  The overall response rate was 66% (69 of 104). Thirty-six percent of participants (n\u00a0= 25) reported not having read a scientific medical article on the topic of artificial intelligence during the past 12 months. Twenty-nine percent of respondents (n\u00a0= 12) reported using artificial intelligence tools during their daily work. Trainees were more likely to express doubts on whether they would have pursued diagnostic radiology as a career had they known of the potential impact artificial intelligence is predicted to have on the specialty (P\u00a0= .0254) and were also more likely to plan to learn about the topic (P\u00a0= .0401).\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  Radiologists lack exposure to current scientific medical articles on artificial intelligence. Trainees are concerned by the implications artificial intelligence may have on their jobs and desire to learn about the topic. There is a need to develop educational resources to help radiologists assume an active role in guiding and facilitating the development and implementation of artificial intelligence tools in diagnostic radiology.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial intelligence"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "diagnostic radiology"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "residency program"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "survey"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1546144017316666", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1546144017316666", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85042191442", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85042191442", "pubmed-id": "29477289", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85042191442", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20180221", "$": "2018-02-21"}}}}}
