A voting perceptron-based automated citation classification system was constructed to classify each article as containing high-quality, drug class\u2013specific evidence or not. Cross-validation experiments were performed to evaluate performance.\n               \n               \n                  Measurements\n                  Precision, recall, and F-measure were evaluated at a range of sample weightings. Work saved over sampling at 95% recall was used as the measure of value to the review process.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  A reduction in the number of articles needing manual review was found for 11 of the 15 drug review topics studied. For three of the topics, the reduction was 50% or greater.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion\n                  Automated document citation classification could be a useful tool in maintaining systematic reviews of the efficacy of drug therapy. Further work is needed to refine the classification system and determine the best manner to integrate the system into the production of systematic reviews.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1067502705002367", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1067502705002367", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "33644696493", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-33644696493", "pubmed-id": "16357352", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33644696493", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20060823", "$": "2006-08-23"}}}}}
