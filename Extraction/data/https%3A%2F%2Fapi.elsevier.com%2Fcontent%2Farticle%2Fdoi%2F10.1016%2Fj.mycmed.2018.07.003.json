In an attempt to increase its anti\u2013Fusarium oxysporum activity, GYM+S (glucose, yeast extract, malt extract and starch) culture medium was selected out of five different production media. Plackett\u2013Burman design (PBD) was used to select yeast extract, malt extract and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) as parameters having significant effects on antifungal activity, and a Box\u2013Behnken design was applied for further optimization. The analysis revealed that the optimum concentrations for the anti\u2013F.\u00a0oxysporum activity of the tested variables were yeast extract 5.03g/L, malt extract 8.05g/L and CaCO3 4.51g/L. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): the Multilayer perceptron (MLP) and the Radial basis function (RBF) were created to predict the anti\u2013F.\u00a0oxysporum activity. The comparison between experimental and predicted outputs from ANN and Response Surface Methodology (RSM) were studied. The ANN model presents an improvement of 14.73%. To our knowledge, this is the first work reporting the statistical versus artificial intelligence -based modeling for the optimization of bioactive molecules against mycotoxigenic and phytopathogenic fungi.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "\n                     Streptomyces sp.
