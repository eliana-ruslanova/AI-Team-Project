In the proposed approach, the self-recurrent wavelet neural network (SRWNN) is employed to construct an adaptive self-recurrent consequent part for each fuzzy rule of TSK fuzzy model. For the IAFWNN controller, the online learning algorithm is based on back propagation (BP) algorithm. Moreover, an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) is used to adapt the learning rate. The aid of an adaptive SRWNN identifier offers the real-time gradient information to the adaptive fuzzy wavelet neural controller to overcome the impact of parameter variations, load disturbances and other uncertainties effectively, and has a good dynamic. The asymptotical stability of the system is guaranteed by using the Lyapunov method. The result of the simulation and the prototype test prove that the proposed are effective and suitable.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "AC servo system"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Self-recurrent wavelet neural network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Indirect adaptive fuzzy wavelet neural controller"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Improved particle swarm optimization"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019057817303816", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019057817303816", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85020126194", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85020126194", "pubmed-id": "28583350", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85020126194", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20170602", "$": "2017-06-02"}}}}}
