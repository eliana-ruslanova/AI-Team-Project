However, limits to realized benefits can arise as patients assume an active role in their health decisions.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  Distinguishing the concepts of health literacy and patient empowerment, we analyze conditions that bias patient use of the Internet and limit access to and impact of artificial intelligence.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  Improving health literacy in the face of the Internet requires significant guidance. Patients must be directed toward the appropriate tools and also provided with key background knowledge enabling them to use the tools and capitalize on the artificial intelligence technology.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion\n                  Benefits of tools employing artificial intelligence to promote health cannot be realized without recognizing and addressing the patients\u2019 desires, expectations, and limitations that impact their Internet behavior. In order to benefit from artificial intelligence, patients need a substantial level of background knowledge and skill in information use\u2014i.e., health literacy.\n               \n               \n                  Practice implications\n                  It is critical that health professionals respond to patient search for information on the Internet, first by guiding their search to relevant, authoritative, and responsive sources, and second by educating patients about how to interpret the information they are likely to encounter.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Health literacy"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Patient empowerment"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Patient education"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Internet"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0738399113001821", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738399113001821", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84880329001", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84880329001", "pubmed-id": "23743214", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84880329001", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20130603", "$": "2013-06-03"}}}}}
