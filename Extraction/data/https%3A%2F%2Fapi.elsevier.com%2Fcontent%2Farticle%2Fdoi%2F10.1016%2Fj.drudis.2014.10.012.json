The explosive growth in the amount of public domain-available chemical and biological data has generated huge effort to design, analyze, and apply novel learning methodologies. Here, I focus on machine-learning techniques within the context of ligand-based VS (LBVS). In addition, I analyze several relevant VS studies from recent publications, providing a detailed view of the current state-of-the-art in this field and highlighting not only the problematic issues, but also the successes and opportunities for further advances.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1359644614004176", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359644614004176", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84925400066", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84925400066", "pubmed-id": "25448759", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84925400066", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20141104", "$": "2014-11-04"}}}}}
