A unified model consisting of a linear dynamic system and a bounded static nonlinear operator is employed to describe these systems, such as neural networks and Takagi and Sugeno (T\u2013S) fuzzy models.

The parameters of these filters are obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem (EVP). As most artificial neural networks or fuzzy systems with or without time delays can be described with this unified model, fusion filter design for these systems can be done in a unified way. Simulation examples are provided to illustrate the design procedure and effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "\n                     \n                        \n                           \n                              H\n                           \n                           \n                              \u221e\n                           \n                        \n                      fusion filtering"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Distributed fusion filter"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Multi-sensor system"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Neural network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Takagi and Sugeno (T\u2013S) fuzzy system"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S089360801000242X", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089360801000242X", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "79951517591", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-79951517591", "pubmed-id": "21167678", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79951517591", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20101124", "$": "2010-11-24"}}}}}
