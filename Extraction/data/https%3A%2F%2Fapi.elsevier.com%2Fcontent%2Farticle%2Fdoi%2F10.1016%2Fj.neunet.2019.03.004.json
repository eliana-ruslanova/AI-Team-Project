Representative one-class classification algorithms include the one-class support vector machine (SVM), Naive Parzen density estimation, autoencoder (AE), etc. Recently, the one-class extreme learning machine (OC-ELM) has been developed for learning acceleration and performance enhancement. But existing one-class algorithms are generally less effective in complex and multi-class classifications. To alleviate the deficiency, a multilayer neural network based one-class classification with ELM (in short, as ML-OCELM) is developed in this paper. The stacked AEs are employed in ML-OCELM to exploit an effective feature representation for complex data. The effective kernel based learning framework is also investigated in the stacked AEs of ML-OCELM, leading to a multilayer kernel based OC-ELM (in short, as MK-OCELM). The MK-OCELM has advantages of less human-intervention parameters and good generalization performance. Experiments on 13 benchmark UCI classification datasets and a real application on urban acoustic classification (UAC) are carried out to show the superiority of the proposed ML-OCELM/MK-OCELM over the OC-ELM and several state-of-the-art algorithms.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "One-class classification"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "OC-ELM"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "ML-OCELM"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Kernel learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Outlier/anomaly detection"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608019300772", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608019300772", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85063345577", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85063345577", "pubmed-id": "30921561", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063345577", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20190319", "$": "2019-03-19"}}}}}
