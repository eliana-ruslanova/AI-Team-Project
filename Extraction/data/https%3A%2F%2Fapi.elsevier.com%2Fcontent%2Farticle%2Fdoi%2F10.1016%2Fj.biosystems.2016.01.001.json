I would like to suggest three that are related to the past, present and future of artificial intelligence. From the past, works in biology and artificial systems by Turing and von Neumann prove highly interesting to explore within the new framework of synthetic biology, especially with regard to the notions of self-modification and self-replication and their links to emergence and the bottom-up approach. The current epistemological inquiry into emergence and research on swarm intelligence, superorganisms and biologically inspired cognitive architecture may lead to new achievements on the possibilities of synthetic biology in explaining cognitive processes. Finally, the present-day discussion on the future of artificial intelligence and the rise of superintelligence may point to some research trends for the future of synthetic biology and help to better define the boundary of notions such as \u201clife\u201d, \u201ccognition\u201d, \u201cartificial\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d, as well as their interconnections in theoretical synthetic biology.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial intelligence"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Synthetic biology"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Cognitive systems"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Emergence"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Superorganism"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Superintelligence"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0303264716300016", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303264716300016", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84956678257", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84956678257", "pubmed-id": "26802674", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84956678257", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20160121", "$": "2016-01-21"}}}}}
