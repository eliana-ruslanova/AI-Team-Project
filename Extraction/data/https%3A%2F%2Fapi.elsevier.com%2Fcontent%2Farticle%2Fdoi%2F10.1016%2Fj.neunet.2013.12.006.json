In addition, there is another difference from conventional neural networks, which is that the output neurons of LSFLN not only receive the information from the hidden layer neurons, but also receive the external information itself directly from the input neurons. In order to test the validity of LSFLN, it is applied to 6 classical regression applications, and also employed to build the functional relation between the combustion efficiency and operating parameters of a 300WM coal-fired boiler. Experimental results show that, compared with other methods, LSFLN with very less hidden neurons could achieve much better regression precision and generalization ability at a much faster learning speed.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial neural network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Least Square Fast Learning Network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Least square"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Coal-fired boiler"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608013003006", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608013003006", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84890908612", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84890908612", "pubmed-id": "24373896", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84890908612", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20131216", "$": "2013-12-16"}}}}}
