This analysis is based on the recently proposed NeuCube spiking neural network (SNN) framework and more specifically on the analysis of the connectivity of a NeuCube model trained with electroencephalography (EEG) data. The case study data used to illustrate this method is EEG data collected from three groups\u2014subjects with opiate addiction, patients undertaking methadone maintenance treatment, and non-drug users/healthy control group. The proposed method classifies more accurately the EEG data than traditional statistical and artificial intelligence (AI) methods and can be used to predict response to treatment and dose-related drug effect. But more importantly, the method can be used to compare functional brain activities of different subjects and the changes of these activities as a result of treatment, which is a step towards a better understanding of both the EEG data and the brain processes that generated it. The method can also be used for a wide range of applications, such as a better understanding of disease progression or aging.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Spiking neural networks"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "NeuCube"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "EEG"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Response to treatment"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Methadone maintenance"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Opiates"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608015000659", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608015000659", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84930227037", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84930227037", "pubmed-id": "26000776", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84930227037", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20150420", "$": "2015-04-20"}}}}}
