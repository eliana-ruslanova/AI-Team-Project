In several application domains, from gene to social network analysis, the labeling is unbalanced: for instance positive labels may be much less than negatives. In this paper we present COSNet (COst Sensitive neural Network), a neural algorithm for predicting node labels in graphs with unbalanced labels. COSNet is based on a 2-parameter family of Hopfield networks, and consists of two main steps: (1) the network parameters are learned through a cost-sensitive optimization procedure; (2) a suitable Hopfield network restricted to the unlabeled nodes is considered and simulated. The reached equilibrium point induces the classification of the unlabeled nodes. The restriction of the dynamics leads to a significant reduction in time complexity and allows the algorithm to nicely scale with large networks. An experimental analysis on real-world unbalanced data, in the context of the genome-wide prediction of gene functions, shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hopfield neural networks"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Semi-supervised learning in graphs"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Learning from unbalanced data"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Node label prediction"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608013000361", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608013000361", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84875251066", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84875251066", "pubmed-id": "23500503", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84875251066", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20130206", "$": "2013-02-06"}}}}}
