The study was performed for 5 different protein kinases, and several sets of compounds (active, inactive and assumed inactives) were docked into their targets. The resulting ligand\u2013protein complexes were represented by the means of structural interaction fingerprints profiles (SIFts profiles) that constituted an input for ML methods. The developed protocol was found to be superior to the combination of classification algorithms with the standard fingerprint MACCSFP.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Structural interaction fingerprint"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Machine learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Virtual screening"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Docking results analysis"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960894X13013899", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960894X13013899", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84891856519", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84891856519", "pubmed-id": "24374279", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84891856519", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20131210", "$": "2013-12-10"}}}}}
