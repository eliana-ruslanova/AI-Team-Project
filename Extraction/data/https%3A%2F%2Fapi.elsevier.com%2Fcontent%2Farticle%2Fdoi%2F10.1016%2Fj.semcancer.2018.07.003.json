In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding phenotypic plasticity of cancer cells, highlighting the kinetics of cancer stem cell and the role of the epithelial mesenchymal transition for metastasis. It appears that the tumor micro-environment plays a crucial role in triggering phenotypic transitions, as we illustrate discussing the challenges posed by macrophages and cancer associated fibroblasts. To disentangle the complexity of environmentally induced phenotypic transitions, there is a growing need for novel advanced algorithms as those proposed in our recent work combining single cell data analysis and numerical simulations of gene regulatory networks. We conclude discussing recent developments in artificial intelligence and its applications to personalized cancer treatment.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Cancer stem cells"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Phenotypic switching"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Metastasis"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Precision medicine"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1044579X18300294", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044579X18300294", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85050002735", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85050002735", "pubmed-id": "30017637", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85050002735", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20180711", "$": "2018-07-11"}}}}}
