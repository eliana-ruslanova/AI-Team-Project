Multi-herb recipes have been routinely used in TCM. These have been formulated by using TCM-defined herbal properties (TCM-HPs), the scientific basis of which is unclear. The usefulness of TCM-HPs was evaluated by analyzing the distribution pattern of TCM-HPs of the constituent herbs in 1161 classical TCM prescriptions, which shows patterns of multi-herb correlation. Two artificial intelligence (AI) methods were used to examine whether TCM-HPs are capable of distinguishing TCM prescriptions from non-TCM recipes. Two AI systems were trained and tested by using 1161 TCM prescriptions, 11,202 non-TCM recipes, and two separate evaluation methods. These systems correctly classified 83.1\u201397.3% of the TCM prescriptions, 90.8\u201392.3% of the non-TCM recipes. These results suggest that TCM-HPs are capable of separating TCM prescriptions from non-TCM recipes, which are useful for formulating TCM prescriptions and consistent with the expected correlation between TCM-HPs and the physicochemical properties of herbal ingredients responsible for producing the collective pharmacological and other effects of specific TCM prescriptions.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Herbal medicine"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Herbal prescriptions"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Herbal property"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Medicinal herb"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Statistical learning method"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Support vector machine"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Traditional medicines"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Traditional Chinese medicine"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "TCM"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874106003205", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874106003205", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "33845516461", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-33845516461", "pubmed-id": "16884871", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33845516461", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20060629", "$": "2006-06-29"}}}}}
