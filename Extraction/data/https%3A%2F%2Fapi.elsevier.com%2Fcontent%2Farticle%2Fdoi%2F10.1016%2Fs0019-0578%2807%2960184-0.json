In the presented work, rules are evaluated using three qualitative metrics based on their representation on the truth space diagram. Performance metrics are then treated as competing objectives and the multiple objective evolutionary algorithm is used to search for an optimal set of nondominant rules. Novel techniques for data pre-processing and rule set post-processing are designed that deal directly with the delays involved in dynamic systems. Data collected from a simulated hot and cold water mixer are used to validate the proposed procedure.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Rule extraction"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Knowledge discovery"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Multiobjective evolutionary algorithm"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Fuzzy logic"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019057807601840", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019057807601840", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "19444368475", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-19444368475", "pubmed-id": "15868868", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/19444368475", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20070119", "$": "2007-01-19"}}}}}
