Abstract Methods for surveillance of adverse events (AEs) in clinical settings are limited by cost, technology, and appropriate data availability. In this study, two methods for semi-automated review of text records within the Veterans Administration database are utilized to identify AEs related to the placement of central venous catheters (CVCs): a Natural Language Processing program and a phrase-matching algorithm. A sample of manually reviewed records were then compared to the results of both methods to assess sensitivity and specificity. The phrase-matching algorithm was found to be a sensitive but relatively non-specific method, whereas a natural language processing system was significantly more specific but less sensitive. Positive predictive values for each method estimated the CVC-associated AE rate at this institution to be 6.4 and 6.2%, respectively. Using both methods together results in acceptable sensitivity and specificity (72.0 and 80.1%, respectively). All methods including manual chart review are limited by incomplete or inaccurate clinician documentation. A secondary finding was related to the completeness of administrative data (ICD-9 and CPT codes) used to identify intensive care unit patients in whom a CVC was placed. Administrative data identified less than 11% of patients who had a CVC placed. This suggests that other methods, including automated methods such as phrase matching, may be more sensitive than administrative data in identifying patients with devices. Considerable potential exists for the use of such methods for the identification of patients at risk, AE surveillance, and prevention of AEs through decision support technologies. Keywords Electronic medical records Natural language processing Adverse events Surveillance 1 Introduction 1.1 Medical device adverse events Since the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released its landmark reports \u201cTo Err is Human\u201d [1] and \u201cCrossing the Quality Chasm,\u201d [2] there has been a great deal of attention focused on studying and preventing medical errors and adverse events (AEs). Patients in an intensive care setting are at particular risk for AEs due to the acuity of their underlying illnesses and the frequent requirement for invasive procedures such as CVCs (Central Venous Catheters) for fluid therapy and hemodynamic monitoring. Unfortunately, these are also the same patients that are least able to tolerate complications. A device-related AE that might be relatively minor in a healthier individual could easily prove fatal to a patient in the intensive care unit. Methods for studying AEs have employed many different strategies and recently have incorporated the use of computer technology [3\u20135]. Overall, the most common methodology for studying AEs has historically involved retrospective chart review. Unfortunately, this is a very time consuming, labor intensive, and expensive research technique. The advent of computerized medical records has allowed the possibility of new tools for retrospective epidemiological and quality assurance activities, ongoing and prospective surveillance, and potentially the prevention of AEs through alerting and decision support mechanisms [6]. One technology, natural language processing (NLP), shows promise in its ability to \u201cread and understand\u201d text based files including patient records [7]. Although simpler, phrase matching is another automated method that can search through text records for specific word combinations that may reflect clinical scenarios. The choice of CVCs as devices to study using text-based technologies was based on their limited number of common associated AEs and, therefore, a relatively limited number of ways in which these events can be described in the patient record. This makes the identification of these AEs a relatively simple model for text based methods. 1.2 Central venous catheters Central venous catheters are medical devices commonly used in intensive care settings to provide reliable intravenous access for fluid therapy, a route for drugs that must be administered via large veins and access for hemodialysis and hemodynamic monitoring. It is estimated that over five million of these catheters are placed every year in the US [8]. There are a number of known complications of CVCs including pneumothorax, chylothorax, bleeding, infection, cardiac dysrhythmias, catheter occlusion, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, venous air embolism, catheter malposition, arterial injury, nerve injury, cardiac tamponade, and death. CVC related AEs are a significant source of morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expense that warrant further evaluation in order to improve care in patients requiring these devices. The identification of these AEs, then, is the first step in understanding the factors predisposing to complications and ultimately in preventing such AEs. 1.3 Natural language processing NLP has been studied for its ability to extract information from a number of clinical sources including discharge summaries and radiology reports. Hripcsak et al. [7] demonstrated that NLP could detect clinical conditions in chest X-rays with a consistency that was indistinguishable from that of physicians reviewing the same reports. Automated coding of clinical concepts into Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) was demonstrated using the Medical Language Extraction and Encoding system (MedLEE) at Columbia University [9]. Recently Bates et al. [3] reported that event monitoring and natural language processing tools could successfully detect certain types of AEs including nosocomial infections, adverse drug events, and patient falls. A variety of adverse events have been accurately detected in discharge summaries by NLP as shown by Melton and Hripcsak [10]. 1.4 Word and phrase-matching algorithms Searching large pieces of text for specific strings is a very common task that is possible due to the existence of electronic data. Regular expressions are important tools in text data manipulation and are extensively used in programming languages. These expressions may allow a highly specific search for matching text or can be created to be very general with the use of wildcards or multiple possible matching characters or words. For example, Fig. 1 demonstrates a very simple regular expression that searches for either \u201ccentral venous catheter\u201d or \u201ccentral line\u201d located within 15 words of either \u201cinfection\u201d or \u201csepsis.\u201d Some possible matching phrases identified by this regular expression are shown below the regular expression. The use of wildcard characters could allow many variations of a root word to be included in the searching expression. The regular expression element \u3008pneumothora[A-Za-z]{1,3}\u3009 could match \u201cpneumothorax\u201d and \u201cpneumothoraces\u201d and even words with typing errors such as \u201cpneumothoraxes\u201d and \u201cpneumothorades,\u201d which may be advantageous. 2 Methods 2.1 Optimization of a phrase-matching algorithm and NLP program for identifying AEs related to CVCs As shown in Fig. 2 the optimization of both semiautomated methods required an iterative process. We used 30 records extracted from the Medical Intensive Care Unit at the Salt Lake City VAMC from November 2001 to September 2004. Abbreviations and a local lexicon used by physicians and nurses in their daily progress notes relating to CVCs were collected from patient records not included in the study group. Additionally, three general surgeons were polled for expressions that were common descriptors for CVCs or CVC related AEs. Finally, we searched the UMLS Metathesaurus for synonymous phrases for CVCs and associated AEs. This resulted in a pool of words and phrases that could be combined in regular expressions to search text. There were 31 phrases for CVCs, 65 phrases for AEs and 7 linking phrases such as \u201ccomplicated by,\u201d \u201cdue to\u201d and \u201cassociated with.\u201d Standard computable regular expressions were used exclusively in the phrase-matching algorithm (PMA) procedures. A training set of patient records was then created by taking 30 MICU records consisting of multiple days of notes and adding each of these expressions relating to CVC AEs. Whenever the program failed to pick up a simulated AE, the regular expression search was modified. A scoring system was developed to reflect the probability of an AE phrase relating to a CVC (Table 1 ). In the test sample of 10 patients with known CVC related AEs, the maximum distance between a CVC phrase and an AE phrase was 15 words and this was taken to be the broadest likely match interval. A slightly narrower interval of 10 words was then chosen to reflect phrases with an even closer association of the concepts. The optimization of MedLEE involved primarily preprocessing to improve MedLEE\u2019s performance. MedLEE was installed with a predefined lexicon on a local workstation using a Solaris 10 platform. A difficulty encountered was that the MedLEE lexicon did not include most abbreviations and common proprietary names for CVCs. This was treated by replacing all of these designations with the generic term \u201ccentral venous catheter\u201d which MedLEE recognized as a medical device entity. Only a substitution of synonyms occurred in this process; no other changes were made that would alter either the syntax or semantics of the original sentence. Finally, the file structure of the records was somewhat problematic in two ways. MedLEE is designed to parse a well-structured medical note following a relatively standard format. For example, one broadly useful processing mode in the program was designed to process discharge summaries that contain typical headings such as admission history, past medical history, medications, physical examination, hospital course, discharge plan, etc. It was unclear how well MedLEE would process the large text files made up of multiple days notes of different types (progress notes, nursing notes, procedure and operative notes, discharge summaries) and different structures. A preprocessing program was used to divide the record into individual notes, have MedLEE parse and process each note and the reconstitute the subsequent XML output. A test record consisting of 10 individual notes was subjected to this process and the output was compared to that of the record processed by MedLEE in its entirety as a single text file. There were slight variations in the beginning and end of the XML output document reflecting the overall structure of the note; however, the elements of interest within the note were unchanged at the level of sentence structure. In other words, there was no apparent loss of information in the XML output because of the loose note structure. In view of this no attempt was made to normalize or alter the structure of the notes used for the evaluation of CVC related AEs. 2.2 Sample selection Patients\u2019 records were selected from the Salt Lake City Veterans Administration Medical Center database using the following criteria: 1. Admission between June 1999 and December 2004 to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) or admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) with patient care provided by a surgical team. 2. Placement of at least one CVC. CPT or ICD-9 procedure codes were used to identify patients having had a CVC placed. The ICD-9 code of 3893 included both CVCs and Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters (PICCs), however. A total of 49 patients with PICCs were excluded from the patient group due to the significantly different technical aspects and risk profiles of these catheters. The characteristics of the records were fairly uniform, consisting of partially templated notes with large free text descriptive entries. The notes included in the patient records were daily physician progress notes, consultation notes, nursing notes, procedure notes, operative reports and discharge summaries. The smallest record was 15Kb and had about 10 physician and nursing notes representing 2 days of hospitalization. There were also several very large records (>1Mb) and representing over 6 weeks of daily notes. Several records in the manually reviewed sample had evidence of placement of multiple CVCs. The notes of each record were converted from a database into a single large plain text file for ease of management and to maintain the temporal relationship of events during the hospitalization. The maintenance of the temporal relationship may be critical in assessing causality of an AE to a device (for example, a pneumothorax that occurs one day before a CVC is placed cannot be due to the CVC). 2.3 Assessment of administrative data used for patient selection The retrospective period included all candidate records from the beginning of utilization of electronic notes in 1999 until December 2004 in order to give the maximum number of patient records. Administrative data (CPT and ICD codes) were collected as described in Section 2.2. This provided only 365 records, and in 49 of these there was no evidence in the text of a CVC being placed so these were excluded (the original goal was 400). In only 56 of these records was there a procedure note documenting the placement of a CVC. 2.4 Development of a manually reviewed reference standard In order for a reference standard to be created, a subset of patient records was collected by subjecting the entire 316 records to the phrase-matching algorithm (Fig. 3 ). The matching files were scored based on presumptive likelihood for the presence of an AE. Thirty records were randomly selected from a group of 49 with the highest scores and were assumed to be enriched for AEs. These 49 records had a score range from 6 to 13 based on the system described in Table 1. An additional 10 records that scored 0 were taken to be extremely unlikely to have evidence of a CVC related AE. These 10 were included in order to ensure the presence of records truly negative for AEs. A total of 40 records was the maximum for which manual review could practically be completed and this determined the need for sampling a selection with the highest and lowest scoring. This subset of 40 records was then manually reviewed by two physicians with at least 2 years of surgical training. There was generally insufficient information in the record for a physician to determine with absolute certainty the presence of a CVC related AE. For example, specific criteria for the diagnosis of a catheter related infection would include positive blood cultures drawn through the catheter, positive catheter tip cultures and signs and symptoms of infection. Most records did not contain explicit information on details such as culture results in order for the reviewers to determine the appropriateness of the clinicians\u2019 diagnoses based on rigid diagnostic criteria. Therefore, the reviewers were instructed to use only the language of the clinician notes in order to draw conclusions regarding the presence of absence of AEs and then assess the likelihood of the event. Specific data collected included the number of distinct CVCs clearly documented in the record, any potential AEs identified, and an assessment of the probability of the event occurring and being due to the CVC (possible, highly likely, certain). After these 40 records were evaluated by two physician reviewers, the results were compared. Any records in which there was a disagreement regarding the presence or absence of an AE were then reviewed by a third reviewer (a Board certified surgeon). A simple majority of the three assessments was used to make the final determination regarding the presence of CVC related AE. Any differences in the number of CVCs determined to be present in the record by the reviewers were resolved by taking a mean of the two or three (when applicable) counts. 2.5 Application of the two semiautomated methods to the included patient records and estimation of the incidence of CVC related AEs All 316 records were subjected to MedLEE, the phrase-matching algorithm, and a method combining both MedLEE and a modified phrase-matching algorithm. Phrase-matching was performed for each regular expression using PowerGrep\u00a9 and each positive record was noted. Records were assigned a score based on the assumed likelihood of the regular expression to be specific for the AE utilizing the scoring system described in Optimization of a Phrase-Matching Algorithm and NLP Program for Identifying AEs Related to CVCs. Records processed with MedLEE resulted in XML output files that could then be searched for AEs associated with CVCs using XQuery. The results for each of the manually reviewed records could then be compared to that produced by the semiautomated methods. This comparison would allow calculation of sensitivity and specificity, as well as positive and negative predictive values. The numbers of positive records generated along with their respective positive predictive values could then estimate the incidence of CVC related AEs. After running both semiautomated methods it appeared that MedLEE would have better specificity than sensitivity and that the opposite was likely for the phrase-matching. In some cases, one method would identify an event when the other did not. Combining the two methods allowed a compromise of sensitivity and specificity. This involved using the phrase-matching algorithm but with a more selective scoring (i.e., only likely records in which the score was >5 were considered positive) and adding those results to the MedLEE positive. This created a combination set of those records found by phrase-matching plus those found by MedLEE. This process is shown diagrammatically in Fig. 3. 2.6 Statistical analyses Agreement between experts in the manual review portion of the study was evaluated with a Kappa statistic. The phrase-matching algorithm, MedLEE and combined methods were assessed for sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative predictive values when compared to the manual reviewer created reference standard. Estimates of CVC related AE rates were determined from the number of positive records found by each method and the respective positive predictive value. Confidence limits were calculated for each rate using the method of Bliss [11]. 3 Results 3.1 Assessment of administrative data The number of patients with CVCs seemed surprisingly low and this led to a confirmatory step to assess the completeness of the administrative data. It is notable that the data collected by the SLC VAMC Department of Surgery is based on physician surgical activity rather than on billing codes for small procedures that may be done as part of the total patient care. Therefore, it is possible to use surgical cases that uniformly utilize CVCs as part of standard patient care to crosscheck the administrative data. The cases chosen for this step were cardiac and aortic procedures done during the same period as that in which the administrative data were collected. Because these patients met all of the CVC inclusion criteria it would be expected that the number of patients captured by each data collection method would be the same. However, this was clearly not the case. Between 1999 and 2004, there were 197 aortic and 1223 cardiac cases (total 1423). In the sample collected during the same time period generated using administrative data there were 163 aortic and cardiac patients. This suggests that administrative data only captured 11.5% of these patients that must have had central lines placed. The possibility of bias in the sample of patients identified by administrative data must also be considered since the assignment of an ICD or CPT code for a CVC placement is unlikely to be random. 3.2 Manual review of subset of records enriched for CVC related AEs Each of the 40 records randomly selected from the phrase matching procedure (30 with possible events, 10 probably without events) were reviewed by two physicians. The total number of distinct central lines found in the 40 reviewed records was 76. The reviewers\u2019 agreement was reasonably good with a Kappa of 0.668. In the cases where there was disagreement a third reviewer served as a tie breaker and then these results formed the reference standard against which to compare the results produced by the phrase matching algorithm and MedLEE. 3.3 Comparison of semiautomated methods with the reference standard and estimation of AEs Each of the semiautomated methods was compared to the manually reviewed reference standard allowing a determination of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive value. Positives are considered true positives when an automated result correlates to a manually reviewed determination of at least a possible AE. These are summarized in Fig. 4 . Table 2 shows the total number of AEs found in the entire sample of 316 records and using the positive predictive value for each method an estimate of the total number of true AEs can be estimated. A range from 6.2 to 10.4% was found by the two individual methods, as well as the combination of the two methods. This is similar to rates reported by other authors for CVC related AEs [12,13]. Based on these results all three of these methods appear to be useful for producing such estimates. 3.4 Failure of automated results The results of both MedLEE and the phrase-matching algorithm were evaluated in comparison to the reviewers\u2019 identification of AEs in order to determine the reason that each method failed in cases with false positives or negatives. Reasons common to both methods were spelling errors in the text of the notes. MedLEE additionally had greater difficulty interpreting local abbreviations such as \u201cinfn\u201d or \u201cinfx\u201d for infection. False positives were also seen in both methods. In many cases in the phrase-matching method, a false positive was generated when physicians documented risks of procedures discussed with the patient. For example, if the physician writes that the \u201crisks of bleeding, infection, thrombosis and death were discussed and consent for CVC placement was obtained\u201d then the phrase-matching algorithm will identify bleeding, infection, thrombosis and death as actual occurrences. MedLEE handled the concept of procedural risk without difficulty but had somewhat similar problems when phrases often associated with CVC AEs were used in proximity to a CVC synonym (\u201cthe patient had ongoing bleeding so the triple lumen catheter was exchanged for a large bore cordis\u201d). 4 Discussion This study demonstrates that semiautomated methods can identify CVC related AEs with reasonable reliability approaching that of human reviewer. That the human reviewers differed on the presence or absence of AEs and on the numbers of catheters recognized may simply reflect the large amount of data to be read and processed. Reviewers tend to skim the text reports and many details that are not emphasized in the report may be missed. This is exemplified by the fact that both reviewers failed to detect any CVCs in 3 of 40 manually reviewed records. In each case the notation indicating the presence of a CVC was a single phrase, typically in the Plan section of the physician note, such as \u201cD/C TLC\u201d (discontinue or remove the triple lumen catheter). The average size of a record was 156Kb or the equivalent of approximately 14 pages and so it is not surprising that brief mentions of this sort might go unnoticed. On the other hand, it also seems likely that a significant AE would receive considerably more mention in the record, possibly repeated over a period of several days since most AEs result in requirement for some additional treatment which may span numerous days. Examples would include a multiple day course of antibiotics for a CVC related infection or a chest tube and daily chest X-rays for a pneumothorax. This effect may tend to underestimate the total number of uncomplicated catheters by manual review. It is conceivable that automated methods may be beneficial in identifying such instances that do not attract the attention of human reviewers. Spelling errors and abbreviations were a clear source of error for all automated methods. All typical abbreviations encountered in the training data were incorporated into the preprocessing step for MedLEE and in the regular expressions for the phrase-matching algorithm. In spite of this, it was apparent on re-evaluating the semiautomated methods\u2019 performance on the manually reviewed records that spelling and abbreviation accounted for some false negatives. This may be a problem peculiar to systems like that at the SLC VAMC where clinician-typed notes vary widely in their spelling accuracy and use of standardized abbreviations. Possible ways to address this problem could include dictation and professional transcription and real time spell checking using a dictionary with locally defined abbreviations and terms. Another limitation of this method relates to the use of a locally defined lexicon for CVC and AE terms. Further study will be necessary to determine how complete this lexicon is both within the VA surgical service and with other specialties and hospital sites. The accuracy of MedLEE, phrase-matching, and the combined semiautomated method was similar to other reported uses of electronic methods for AE detection. Bates et al. [3] reported a sensitivity of 69%, specificity of 48% and PPV of 52% in his study using an electronic tool to screen discharge summaries for 11 AE categories including failure of medical management, hospital incurred trauma and adverse drug events. A study that evaluated MedLEE for its ability to detect AEs from discharge summaries [14] demonstrated a sensitivity of 28%, a specificity of 98.5% and a PPV of 45%. The combined method reported here achieved a sensitivity of 72%, a specificity of 80.8 and a PPV 64.3%. That these numbers are generally somewhat higher than those reported by Bates et al. and Melton and Hripcsak [14] may reflect the much narrower clinical scope of AEs being studied in this study. It would seem logical that it is easier to develop a method to detect possible permutations of text-based descriptions of AEs when the specific types of AEs are relatively few in number as is the case with CVC related complications. However, it is notable that the quality of the text data used in this study was substantially different than that used in previous work. The VA data used in this study included physician entered notes with a high frequency of spelling and grammatical errors that may limit the success of automated methods whereas both studies by Bates et al. [3] and Melton and Hripcsak [14] used discharge summaries that are likely to have been professionally transcribed and more highly edited. Other authors have reported results of test based utilities to identify AEs in hospital discharge summaries. Melton and Hripcsak [14] used Natural Language Processing to detect a broad range of different AEs. Similarly, Murff et al. [15] used discharge summaries to identify a variety of events by association with \u201ctrigger\u201d words. This is somewhat analogous to the concept of the phrase-matching algorithm. Fig. 5 compares the Melton\u2019s and Murff\u2019s reported results with those obtained from this study. This study estimated the overall incidence of CVC related AEs to be 6\u201310% over the life of the catheter. It is important to point out that in SLC VAMC SICU patient population the life of a CVC may be highly variable. Uncomplicated CVCs placed routinely for intra-operative hemodynamic monitoring may be removed within 48h of placement. On the other hand, long-term hemodialysis access may remain in place for months. Some studies in which routine surveillance is performed for infection or thrombosis report very high rates of these AEs [12,16,17] of up to 30%. The estimate found by automated methods in this study appears to be well within the range of incidences reported in the literature. It may be possible to improve these automated methods in with different strategies. Spelling errors and abbreviations unrecognized by the methods may be addressed with a modification of the preprocessing step. Conversely, the same result may be accomplished by directly altering the regular expressions in the phrase-matching algorithm or adding to the NLP program\u2019s lexicon. If both methods were to be used together as in our combined method, it would be more elegant to use a preprocessing step. Ideally, correction of these errors would occur as the note was being entered into the EMR by the physician by a spell-check step and this would minimize the need for extensive preprocessing. The potential of these methods for surveillance purposes and possibly for integration into an electronic medical record system containing alerting and other decision support capabilities is substantial. From a technical standpoint these methods could be relatively easily integrated into such an EMR system with alerting and decision support functionality. Automated encoding of concepts relating to procedures with intrinsic risk and possible AE outcomes into a controlled medical terminology such as UMLS may facilitate the development of clinically logical algorithms or rule sets. The methods could be further modified to identify other types of AEs by using a methodology similar to that described here to gather phrases that could indicate the presence of a specific event. In this particular example of CVC related AEs, the PPVs found (ranging from 41% for the PMA to 70% for MedLEE) were certainly high enough to be useful for surveillance purposes. Assuming that human reviewers are used to confirm AEs, they would only need to read about two records for every case of CVC-related AEs. Given that the frequency of AEs estimated at the SLC VAMC was 6\u201311%, the methods could markedly reduce the number of negative charts for the reviewers to process. The assessment of the accuracy of administrative data for identification of patients with CVCs suggests that only 11% of patients with CVCs may be detected with this method. Whether a sample produced by administrative data creates bias in our study patients is unknown. It is conceivable that a clerk reviewing a chart for billable procedures and diagnoses may be more likely to miss the uncomplicated cases. This would suggest that our sample might have selection bias towards patients with AEs and thus overestimate the incidence of these events. On the other hand, CVCs that are placed as surgical procedures (this would include implanted long-term venous access devices for chemotherapy, renal dialysis and total parenteral nutrition) are more likely to be included in administrative data as typically all procedures performed in the operating room will generate a billable CPT code. Short term CVCs placed as part of anesthesia care or in a patient ward may not trigger a billing charge and may not be represented in administrative data. This possibility would tend to overestimate CVCs placed in the highly controlled and sterile conditions of the operating room. The ready availability of additional technology such as ultrasound and fluoroscopy may also decrease the mechanical risks of the procedure. Interestingly, the incidence found in this study was well within the range reported by other authors and so these are unlikely to be large effects. 5 Conclusions Identification of AEs plays an important role in quality assurance activities and the development of methods that can ameliorate the time and economic burden of manual review are potentially of great benefit. This study demonstrates that it is possible to create semiautomated methods that can retrospectively identify CVC related AEs with sufficient sensitivity and specificity for surveillance purposes. In addition, the results raise questions about the validity of administrative date while also providing a possible solution with the use of text based methods to identify patients of interest. Furthermore, using such methods in systems designed for early or real-time identification of factors associated with the risk of developing AEs may allow prevention of these events. While surveillance for quality assurance purposes is certainly an important function, the potential use in preventing harm from devices with a certain intrinsic risk is a very exciting potential application of the technology. Considerable work remains to be done to unequivocally demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness and value of such an application.

In this study, two methods for semi-automated review of text records within the Veterans Administration database are utilized to identify AEs related to the placement of central venous catheters (CVCs): a Natural Language Processing program and a phrase-matching algorithm. A sample of manually reviewed records were then compared to the results of both methods to assess sensitivity and specificity. The phrase-matching algorithm was found to be a sensitive but relatively non-specific method, whereas a natural language processing system was significantly more specific but less sensitive. Positive predictive values for each method estimated the CVC-associated AE rate at this institution to be 6.4 and 6.2%, respectively. Using both methods together results in acceptable sensitivity and specificity (72.0 and 80.1%, respectively). All methods including manual chart review are limited by incomplete or inaccurate clinician documentation. A secondary finding was related to the completeness of administrative data (ICD-9 and CPT codes) used to identify intensive care unit patients in whom a CVC was placed. Administrative data identified less than 11% of patients who had a CVC placed. This suggests that other methods, including automated methods such as phrase matching, may be more sensitive than administrative data in identifying patients with devices.
