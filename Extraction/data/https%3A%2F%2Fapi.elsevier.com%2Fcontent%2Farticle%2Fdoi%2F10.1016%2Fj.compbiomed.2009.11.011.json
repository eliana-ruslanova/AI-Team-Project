Another shortcoming of the previously reported methods is that they cannot estimate the probability that a candidate sequence will silence the target gene. This paper first reviewed the recently reported siRNA design guidelines and clarified the problems concerning the guidelines. It then proposed two prediction methods\u2014Radial Basis Function (RBF) network and decision tree learning\u2014and their combined method for selecting effective siRNA target sequences from many possible candidate sequences. They are quite different from the previous score-based siRNA design techniques and can predict the probability that a candidate siRNA sequence will be effective. The methods imply high estimation accuracy for selecting candidate siRNA sequences.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "RNA interference"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "siRNA design"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Gene silencing"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Estimation of gene silencing"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "RBF network"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010482509002066", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482509002066", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "77649184817", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-77649184817", "pubmed-id": "20022002", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77649184817", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20091217", "$": "2009-12-17"}}}}}
