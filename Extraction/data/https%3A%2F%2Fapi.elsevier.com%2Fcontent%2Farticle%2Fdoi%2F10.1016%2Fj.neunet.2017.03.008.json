However, the communication and computational system limitations of currently used supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system can only deliver delayed information. However, the deployment of synchrophasor measurement devices makes it possible to capture and visualize, in near-real-time, grid operational data with extra granularity. In this paper, a cellular computational network (CCN) approach for frequency situational intelligence (FSI) in a power system is presented. The distributed and scalable computing unit of the CCN framework makes it particularly flexible for customization for a particular set of prediction requirements. Two soft-computing algorithms have been implemented in the CCN framework: a cellular generalized neuron network (CCGNN) and a cellular multi-layer perceptron network (CCMLPN), for purposes of providing multi-timescale frequency predictions, ranging from 16.67 ms to 2 s. These two developed CCGNN and CCMLPN systems were then implemented on two different scales of power systems, one of which installed a large photovoltaic plant. A real-time power system simulator at weather station within the Real-Time Power and Intelligent Systems (RTPIS) laboratory at Clemson, SC, was then used to derive typical FSI results.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Cellular computational network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Frequency situational intelligence"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Generalized neuron"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Multilayer perceptron"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Particle swarm optimization"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Synchrophasor"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608017300643", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608017300643", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85019929662", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85019929662", "pubmed-id": "28527861", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85019929662", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20170404", "$": "2017-04-04"}}}}}
