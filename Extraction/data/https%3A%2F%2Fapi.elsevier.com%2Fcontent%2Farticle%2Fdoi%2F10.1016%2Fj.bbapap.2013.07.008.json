In this work, a novel approach was introduced to encode drug and enzyme molecules with physicochemical molecular descriptors and pseudo amino acid composition, respectively. Based on this encoding method, Random Forest was adopted to build the drug\u2013enzyme interaction network. After selecting the optimal features that are able to represent the main factors of drug\u2013enzyme interaction in our prediction, a total of 129 features were attained which can be clustered into nine categories: Elemental Analysis, Geometry, Chemistry, Amino Acid Composition, Secondary Structure, Polarity, Molecular Volume, Codon Diversity and Electrostatic Charge. It is further found that Geometry features were the most important of all the features. As a result, our predicting model achieved an MCC of 0.915 and a sensitivity of 87.9% at the specificity level of 99.8% for 10-fold cross-validation test, and achieved an MCC of 0.895 and a sensitivity of 95.7% at the specificity level of 95.4% for independent set test.
