This editorial is designed to inform the ENT community about a concept that will probably profoundly modify our clinical practice in the years to come: Big Data. Big Data is the inevitable consequence of the exponential growth of Internet (90% of data in the world have been created over the last two years) and the development of Internet Of Things (IoT). Big Data is defined by 3 Vs: Volume (huge quantity of data, several Zettaoctets), Velocity (real-time processing of these data, streaming) and Variety (text, words, videos, photography, geolocalization, mood, transactions, etc.). A fourth V can be added: the Value of the resulting information. Internet giants (Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon) have clearly understood the stakes involved. The aggregation and complex analysis of these unstructured Big Data allow more precise targeting of the needs and availability of subjects in relation to advertising and can be used to influence their decision-making. For example, one of your friends (identified by means of a social network, e-mail, associated geolocalization, etc.) has just changed telephone operators; it is the ideal time to send you an advertisement about this operator; if you talk to your friend, he or she will be full of praise for the new operator. Barack Obama's second election campaign in 2012 also used Big Data, which probably had a considerable impact on his victory. Big Data will be progressively developed in the medical world. For example, most smartphones now comprise a health application (number of steps, distance walked, etc.) and analysis of Big Data (Google searches) is able to predict epidemics just as reliably, if not better, than sentinel networks [1]. Epidemiological studies using Big Data analysis have already been published: in ENT, for example, a recent study examined the relationships between environmental factors and sinusitis [2]. In several years\u2019 time, the choice of cancer chemotherapy could well be based on predictive analysis of Big Data to allow increasingly personalized medicine: by comparing personal and tumour genomic, anthropometric, laboratory, medical, therapeutic, social, and environmental data with those of all patients in a similar situation, it could be possible to propose the chemotherapy associated with the best benefit\u2013risk balance. The challenge for companies is therefore to develop algorithms and analysis techniques able to exploit these Big Data. One example is that of the Watson artificial intelligence developed by IBM, which now has an application in oncology. Big Data will also have applications in the growing field of smart medical devices, especially hearing aids and cochlear implants. Whether we like it or not, Big Data and e-health are going to occupy an important place in our patients\u2019 lives and in medical decision-making: healthcare personnel must be able to understand not only the mechanisms, stakes, and benefits (decreased costs and personalized medicine), but also the risks involved, as the use of Big Data also raises ethical and privacy issues [3].
