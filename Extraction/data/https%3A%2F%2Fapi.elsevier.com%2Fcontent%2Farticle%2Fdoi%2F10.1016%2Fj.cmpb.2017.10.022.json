The aim of our study is to develop a new artificial intelligence based diagnostic model that is accurate, fast, non-invasive and cost effective to diagnose TPE. It is expected that a tool derived based on the model be installed on simple computer devices (such as smart phones and tablets) and be used by clinicians widely.\n                  \n                     Methods: For this study, data of 140 patients whose clinical signs, routine blood test results, blood biochemistry markers, pleural fluid cell type and count, and pleural fluid biochemical tests\u2019 results were prospectively collected into a database. An Artificial intelligence based diagnostic model, which employs moth flame optimization based support vector machine with feature selection (FS-MFO-SVM), is constructed to predict the diagnosis of TPE.\n                  \n                     Results: The optimal model results in an average of 95% accuracy (ACC), 0.9564 the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 93.35% sensitivity, and 97.57% specificity for FS-MFO-SVM.\n                  \n                     Conclusions: The proposed artificial intelligence based diagnostic model is found to be highly reliable for diagnosing TPE based on simple clinical signs, blood samples and pleural effusion samples. Therefore, the proposed model can be widely used in clinical practice and further evaluated for use as a substitute of invasive pleural biopsies.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Tuberculosis"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Pleural effusions"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Support vector machine"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Moth flame optimization"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Prediction"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169260717309288", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260717309288", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85032184567", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85032184567", "pubmed-id": "29157454", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85032184567", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20171018", "$": "2017-10-18"}}}}}
