Abstract Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Therefore, research on prevention and treatment for stroke has great significance. In recent years, the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has brought new hopes to healthcare. The resulting partnerships between clinicians and computation science scientists, supported by growing strength of clinical informatics, are beginning to yield positive results. AI techniques have been used successfully in skin/cancer-related studies. Besides that, AI also have been used more and more in the field of stroke. In this review we summarized the application of artificial intelligence in the four main areas of stroke care: diagnosis, outcome prediction, treatment and rehabilitation. Finally, we look forward to the current studies of AI-assisted medical care and make some suggestions for the future potential development direction. Keywords Artificial intelligence Stroke Machine learning Diagnosis Review According to a report from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2016 Lifetime Risk of Stroke Collaborators, stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide and its incidence is increasing because the population ages. 1,2 According to recent data provided by the American Heart Association (AHA) in 2018, there are around 610,000 new stroke patients and 185,000 recurrent stroke patients in the United States per year, 87% of which are ischemic stroke patients, 10% are cerebral hemorrhage patients and 3% are subarachnoid hemorrhage patients. 3 From the year 1990 to 2010, the absolute number of hemorrhagic stroke cases increased by 47%, mostly occurring in low- and middle-income countries. 4 The concept of artificial intelligence (AI) has been put forward ever since 1950s and it has experienced several ups and downs. The recent introduction and development of deep learning (DL) has significantly improved this field. Since 2010 DL has made success, producing systems able to learn without having to be explicitly programmed, by building a model from sample inputs. 5 As a method of pattern recognition and modeling in machine learning (ML), DL has been applied to speech recognition, text translation, image classification, autonomous driving and many other domains. 5 In the last few years, AI has also been rapidly implemented in the medical field applications. It has made outstanding achievements in the applications of dermatology, 6 pathology, 7 cancer 8 as well as numerous promising studies in the field of neuroscience and stroke. Nevertheless, the literature summarizing the progress of AI in the diagnosis and treatment of stroke is very limited. In this review we summarize the recent studies representing the current progress in AI-based applications in the field of stroke, which included three aspects: AI-based technology and its several common concepts, AI applications in the process of stroke diagnosis and treatment and finally a summary and some perspective on the current development of AI technology in the field of stroke. With medical data and precision medicine in the background, AI is trying to describe the blueprint of how to handle and conquer stroke in a more comprehensive manner. 1 AI AI is an important advanced branch of computer science, which was first proposed by J. McCarthy in 1955, 9 Alan Turing, the father of computational science, defines AI systems as machines that can operate as intelligently as humans, 10 The field of AI is based on cutting edge technologies, including ML and natural language processing that have made great progress in developing intelligent algorithms and computing systems. It will support intelligent data retrieval and processing from electronic health records. 11,12 ML is an important branch of AI with the purpose of designing and implementing algorithms and structures to simulate human learning activities. Such algorithms have been applied to identify and analyze data, and also to learn to make inferences and predictions. Common algorithms include decision trees, random decision forests, artificial neural network, support vector machine and Bayes learning algorithm. These learning algorithms are trained by the manual marking process to speed up the classification or regression algorithm applied on the data, but they generally take a long period of time. 13 Artificial neural networks are highly valued ML tools. Inspired by biological neural network, these networks consist of an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. The input layer is responsible for receiving the data/signal, while the hidden layer takes care of data decomposition and processing. Finally, the result (value/class) is integrated into the output layer. 13 Artificial neural networks are very flexible when dealing with various types of data and have received much attention in the ML field. However, traditional artificial neural networks are susceptible to data over-fitting. On the other hand, the parameter training approach is inefficient. As compared with biological neural networks, it belongs to the category of shallow artificial neural networks. In 2006, Hinton and his student Salakhutdinov published a study in Science 14 focusing on the concept of a multi-hidden deep neural network, and the DL field has rapidly developed ever since. In order to simulate the hierarchical structure of the brain, multiple hidden layers have been used in DL. By extracting the information from low-level to high-level features layer by layer, the corresponding complex mapping relationship can be established. 15 As a branch of ML, DL is also divided into supervised and unsupervised learning. DL is the most widely applied AI-based approach in the field of speech recognition and image recognition. Application of deep learning algorithms to pathology images is possible. In 2017, a researcher challenge competition (CAMELYON16) has compared the performance of automated DL algorithms with pathologists' diagnoses at detection of lymph nodes metastases in women with breast cancer, and some DL algorithms achieved better diagnostic performance. 8 The Deep convolutional neural networks can also achieve performance with 21 board-certified dermatologists on classifying skin cancer. 6 Despite few of these sophisticated AI technologies are in clinical use now, they still give people hope and excitement about AI-based applications in the future. 2 AI-based applications in the diagnosis and treatment of stroke The first breakthrough in AI's application in the medical field was concerning medical imaging. An editorial of the Radiology journal in 2018 pointed out that AI has recently made great progress in the field of medical imaging. Seeing the rapid growth in the past three years, AI-themed publications now account for about 10% of journals\u2019 publications. 16 AI has also made great achievements in the detection and classification of certain types of tumors. Taking lung cancer as an example, DL can detect and analyze the nature of lung nodules, malignancy as well as whether there is a distant metastasis or lymph node metastasis. 17 In the field of stroke, AI can also provide assistance in all aspects of diagnosis and treatment by analyzing medical imaging data, leading to early detection and diagnosis, outcome estimation and prognosis assessment, assistance with therapy and rehabilitation. 18\u201320 2.1 AI-based diagnosis Many studies focused on the use of in-depth machine learning tools for automatic segmentation of medical imaging upon stroke lesions. The automatic segmentation of images is one of the hotspots of AI application. Held in 2015, the Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation challenge (ISLES) 21 presented the first-placed model for a 3D-convolutional neural network 22 that was first proposed in a multi modal brain MRI with a depth of 11-layer and a fully automated segmentation multiscale method. Other examples include Pustina et al. 23 who implemented the two-layer convolutional neural network used by the neighborhood identification data analysis, Chen et al. 24 who used the two-layer convolutional neural network to perform automatic segmentation, not that different from manual segmentation, Scherer et al. 25 who used an automatic segmentation model implementing the random forest method to accurately segment the hematoma volume of cerebral hemorrhage on CT scans and Prevedello et al. 26 who developed an AI algorithm to identify cerebral hemorrhage, mass effect, hydrocephalus and other features in CT using DL technique that achieved high accuracy. Later on, Chen et al. 27 developed an ML-based algorithm that can automatically segment and quantify cerebrospinal fluid in consecutive CT examinations of patients with stroke, thus predicting the progression of cerebral edema. The combination of AI and medical imaging provides a more accurate interpretation of imaging results that is both fast and of high-quality. Given the high incidence and morbidity rate and the tight intervening window following stroke, it is extremely critical for physicians to accurately diagnose stroke and take prompt action at the first visit. A very good application was presented by Abedi et al. 28 in the form of an artificial neural network model to analyze the medical data including clinical manifestations, medical history and imaging data of patients with stroke-like symptoms within 4.5 h after the symptoms appeared to quickly diagnose acute cerebral ischemia and differentiate it from other types of diseases similar to stroke. A total of 260 patients were enrolled in this study and 10 rounds of artificial neural network model learning and testing were carried out. They developed the ANN model using a package in R software named Neuralnet and built 10 neural networks based on 10 training sets. The results showed that the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosing cerebral ischemia were 80.0% and 86.2%, respectively, and the median accuracy was 92%. Although this model could not differentiate anterior or posterior ischemia subtypes, it showed the great potential of artificial neural network in assisting quick diagnosis of ischemic stroke. More studies on diagnoses have been summarized in Table 1 . 2.2 Ai-based prediction and assisted decision making A recent study that was published in Stroke has used DL modeling to predict the final infarct size in patients with stroke. A total of 222 patients were enrolled in this study, including 187 patients who received rtPA therapy. Another study by Nielsen et al. 36 used deep convolutional neural networks and showed that deep convolutional neural networks are more accurate than shallow convolutional neural networks as they can distinguish whether to accept the difference in the final infarct size caused by rtPA treatment. Combined with big data, AI can also improve prediction accuracy when predicting outcomes such as mortality or survival rates. Chen-Ying et al. 37 presented an interesting work at the 39th IEEE International Conference on Medicine and Biology Engineering (EMBC), reporting on the large-scale electronic medical record database of approximately 800,000 patients about comparing deep neural networks with other three ML methods to predict 5-year incidence of stroke. Their results showed that the prediction accuracy of the deep neural network is relatively higher while requiring a relatively smaller amount of patient data. On February 13, 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the sale of Viz.AI Contact software, a clinical decision-making support software to predict possible stroke in patients by analyzing CT imaging. When a large blood vessel is found to be blocked, a text message is sent to the supervising neurologist. According to FDA reports, the software was used in a retrospective clinical study containing 300 CT images, while two professional neuroradiologists examined the actual cerebral vascular occlusion, evaluating the image analysis algorithms and the alert notification system of the Viz. AI Contact application. Its performance was evaluated by notifying the neurologist earlier in the event of a suspected vascular occlusion, thereby reducing the resulting brain tissue damage. 16 Additionally, prognostic assessment can also be achieved through AI. Basically, functional findings of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and structural images can also be used as input features to ML systems to predict functional consequences after stroke, such as motor dysfunction 38 among other types of injuries according to behavioral assessments. 39 Currently, ML has some small-scale applications and studies in the field of stroke (Table 2 ), these systems will next be validated, improved and extended to cover a larger scale. With the ongoing advancements, the future might bring online systems that can input clinical data to obtain predicted outcomes, and pave the way towards more advanced AI-assisted medical applications. 2.3 AI-assisted treatment When it comes to stroke treatment, the current usage of AI is mainly to assist decision-making process of specialists and supervise patients to improve compliance. This was tested by Labovitz et al. 45 who evaluated whether the use of AI platforms equipped mobile devices could help stroke patients have better compliance with anticoagulant therapy. Software algorithms identified the patient, the medication, and confirmed ingestion. The results showed that the adherence of the patients who used the AI platform was significantly higher than those who have not used it, and the pre- and post-study questionnaires showed that the patients had a great experience, including some older patients who are not familiar with new technologies. This study was the first successful application of AI platforms to demonstrate drug compliance of the patients, and it indicated the enormous potential of AI in assisting physicians in patient care management. In terms of decision-making on treatment options, a good example is the work of Bentley et al. 46 who used a SVM model to analyze CT images to help predict whether cerebral hemorrhage might occur after thrombolytic therapy in patients with ischemic stroke, thereby helping to decide on the best thrombolytic therapy for these patients. 2.4 AI-assisted rehabilitation Cerebrovascular diseases remain the leading cause of strokes worldwide. After stroke, rehabilitation therapy starts and it is based on the mechanism of exercising and training to promote the neural network plasticity, with the aim to enhance functional recovery of the limbs and improve the patient\u2019s life quality. 47 Upper extremity paralysis is the most common injury following stroke, affecting around 75% of stroke patients and causing difficulty in handling fine movements which is very inconvenient for the daily life. 48 Although the wristband motion sensor has been applied to the rehabilitation of home environment, the device is still unable to distinguish between target- and non-target-oriented motions. Compared with the appropriate exercise quality, the current system is more focused on recording the number and intensity of exercise. 49 Lee et al. 50 proposed a system to assist post-stroke functional rehabilitation. The system consists of two wearable sensors to record inertial data (e.g., acceleration and rotational velocity), one worn on the stroke-affected upper limb and the other on the contralateral upper limb. Using ML algorithms can help the patients to detect target-oriented upper limb movements and provide immediate feedback. Likewise, ML has been combined with wearable devices in studies led by Yang et al., 51 in which gestures and user's hand movement intentions can be recognized on five-finger robots via textile electrodes and ML algorithms providing patients with a feedback on muscles\u2019 activity in real time. The random forest model developed by O\u2019Brien et al. 52 identifies healthy and impaired gait of stroke patients based on athletic data collected by smartphones. In short, there are many subfields where AI and rehabilitation can be combined, but the effects and long-term feasibility of these AI-based technologies are yet to be verified. 3 Conclusion and future perspectives Overall, AI is always improving the efficiency of medical images reading, assisting in the diagnosis and treatment systems and helping with the personalization of rehabilitation training, in order to achieve more precise application in the medical management of stroke. The imaging data of stroke is widely handled by DL, achieving automatic segmentation of lesions, automated characterization and multimodal prediction. 22,24 Since the diagnosis of stroke is mainly confirmed by imaging, and taking into consideration the large amount of imaging data being collected, processed and compared, AI-based methods have the advantages of being fast and accurate, of low cost, easy to promote and able to provide remotely assisted diagnosis. However, we are currently facing some difficulties. Firstly, due to the confidentiality and privacy rules of the data from various hospitals, AI systems that require a large amount of data training might have some difficulties gaining access to those resources. Secondly, to ensure the accuracy of diagnosis, a large amount of clinically confirmed diagnoses must be available. The imaging data and the medical record data should be exported, thus the loads of subsequent work could be enormous. In the future, wide range research and further identification and information digests of multiple imaging data will be needed to guarantee accurate predictions, this will provide work guidelines for future clinical practices. The situation of clinical decision-making is quite similar: only one single problem can be currently solved at a time, and it is not possible to make accurate assessments upon sophisticated situations. However, patients under real-life circumstances may have a combination of more complicated situations resulting from the complications of multiple diseases, which definitely requires a comprehensive consideration from multiple perspectives. Therefore, bringing decision-assisted systems as close as possible to real-world decisions is an extremely critical issue. Hospitals with high levels of diagnosis and treatment are required to work side by side with software development companies in order to develop powerful AI platforms, which can also be updated at any time based on current research progress. It is necessary to continue to develop expert systems and DL-based systems, in order to achieve satisfying AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment software. In the field of rehabilitation, AI has a very broad potential for applications, not only regarding patients with disabilities caused by stroke, but also those suffering from physical dysfunction caused by various reasons. Many rehabilitation exercises could be more feasible when combined with AI systems. However, it is important to mention that accurate diagnosis and training mode are very critical, and rehabilitation training is different for different parts of the limbs and different degrees of post-stroke patients. To achieve AI-based personalized assessment and rehabilitation training, all disciplines should cooperate, in order to effectively improve the desired neurological function with regard to distinct types of neurological dysfunction. The current application of AI technology in the field of stroke is still immature, tremendous groundwork is still needed regarding further investigations. Given that new technologies have shown strong learning ability and generalization capacity, they could be expected to achieve human-level intelligence in the future. Once AI-based diagnostic approach and decision-making system has been finalized, it would bring great convenience to patients, which means that more affordable medical services with better quality will be available. AI technologies will not only significantly improve the medical level of primary hospitals but they will also achieve regional medical homogenization.

Therefore, research on prevention and treatment for stroke has great significance. In recent years, the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has brought new hopes to healthcare. The resulting partnerships between clinicians and computation science scientists, supported by growing strength of clinical informatics, are beginning to yield positive results. AI techniques have been used successfully in skin/cancer-related studies. Besides that, AI also have been used more and more in the field of stroke. In this review we summarized the application of artificial intelligence in the four main areas of stroke care: diagnosis, outcome prediction, treatment and rehabilitation. Finally, we look forward to the current studies of AI-assisted medical care and make some suggestions for the future potential development direction.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2020-02-13", "openaccessUserLicense": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589238X20300127", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Ma, Yang"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Zhang, Ping"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Tang, Yingxin"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Pan, Chao"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Li, Gaigai"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Liu, Na"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hu, Yang"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Tang, Zhouping"}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589238X20300127"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589238X20300127"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": "Full", "pii": "S2589-238X(20)30012-7", "prism:publisher": "Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of KeAi Communications Co., Ltd.", "dc:title": "Artificial intelligence: The dawn of a new era for cutting-edge technology based diagnosis and treatment for stroke", "prism:copyright": "\u00a9 2020 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of KeAi Communications Co., Ltd.", "openaccess": "1", "prism:issn": "2589238X", "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial intelligence"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Stroke"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Machine learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Diagnosis"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Review"}], "openaccessArticle": "true", "prism:publicationName": "Brain Hemorrhages", "openaccessSponsorType": "FundingBody", "pubType": "Review article", "prism:coverDisplayDate": "Available online 13 February 2020", "prism:doi": "10.1016/j.hest.2020.01.006", "dc:identifier": "doi:10.1016/j.hest.2020.01.006", "openaccessSponsorName": "International Hemorrhagic Stroke Association"}}
