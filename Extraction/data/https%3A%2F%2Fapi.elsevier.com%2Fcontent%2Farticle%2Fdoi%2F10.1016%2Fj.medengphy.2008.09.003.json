Recent advancements in technology, including computation, robotics, machine learning, communication, and miniaturization of sensors have been used primarily in manufacturing, military, space exploration, and entertainment. However, few efforts have been made to utilize these technologies to enhance the quality of life of people with disabilities. This article offers a perspective of future development in seven emerging areas: translation of research into clinical practice, pervasive assistive technology, cognitive assistive technologies, rehabilitation monitoring and coaching technologies, robotic assisted therapy, and personal mobility and manipulation technology.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Rehabilitation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Intelligent systems"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Machine learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Physical impairment"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Wheelchairs"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Cognitive impairment"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1350453308001641", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350453308001641", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "56249114820", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-56249114820", "pubmed-id": "18993108", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/56249114820", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20081106", "$": "2008-11-06"}}}}}
