It has been proposed that the IT2FNN controller can be used for the control of a multivariable anesthesia system to minimize the effects of surgical stimulation and to overcome the uncertainty problem introduced by the large inter-individual variability of the patient parameters. The parameters of the IT2FNN controller were trained online using a back-propagation algorithm.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  Three experimental cases are presented. All of the experimental results show good performance for the proposed controller over a wide range of patient parameters. Additionally, the results show better performance than the type-1 fuzzy neural network (T1FNN) controller under the effect of surgical stimulation. The response of the proposed controller has a smaller settling time and a smaller overshoot compared with the T1FNN controller and the adaptive interval type-2 fuzzy logic controller (AIT2FLC). The values of the performance indices for the proposed controller are lower than those obtained for the T1FNN controller and the AIT2FLC.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion\n                  The IT2FNN controller is superior to the T1FNN controller for the handling of uncertain information due to the structure of type-2 fuzzy logic systems (FLSs), which are able to model and minimize the numerical and linguistic uncertainties associated with the inputs and outputs of the FLSs.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hardware-in-the-loop"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Back-propagation algorithm"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Interval type-2 fuzzy neural network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Anesthesia"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Analgesia"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Muscle relaxation"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0933365714000219", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365714000219", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84900528014", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84900528014", "pubmed-id": "24703775", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84900528014", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20140319", "$": "2014-03-19"}}}}}
