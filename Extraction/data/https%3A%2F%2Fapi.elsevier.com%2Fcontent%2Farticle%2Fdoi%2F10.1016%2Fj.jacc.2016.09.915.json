Corresponding Author Key Words algorithm artificial intelligence computer hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Computers are incredibly fast, accurate, and stupid. Human beings are incredibly slow, inaccurate, and brilliant. Together they are powerful beyond imagination. \u2014Albert Einstein (1) As I read the exciting work of Narula et al. (2) published in this issue of the Journal, I could not help but be transported back to the early days of my career at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. It is always enjoyable to take a journey down memory lane! Ralph E. Smith, MD, was the director of the Mayo electrocardiographic laboratory. He had a passion for the computerization of the electrocardiogram (ECG), and 50 years ago, he joined with Clyde Hyde, PhD, of IBM (at the plant also in Rochester, Minnesota) to develop a computer analysis program for ECG. They presented their findings regarding the Smith-Hyde-Mayo-IBM ECG Analysis Program at the Third Annual Rocky Mountain Bioengineering Symposium (3). This represented a bold venture, indeed, for its time (4): the use of artificial intelligence in cardiology. (Webster\u2019s definition of artificial intelligence is \u201cdevelopment of computers to engage in human-like thought processes, such as learning, reasoning, and self-correction.\u201d) Subsequent partnership of Ralph Smith with Mike Cudahy of Marquette Electronics (Milwaukee, Wisconsin) led to further refinements, miniaturization, and commercialization\u2014and the rest is history (5). Cardiologists of the bygone era always carried calipers in their pocket so they could make painstaking measurements of P-, Q-, R-, S-, and T-wave durations and R-R cycle variability. Now these same measurements are accurately and reproducibly performed by computers. No more calipers! Furthermore, cardiologists have witnessed marked improvements in the computer interpretation of abnormal ECG, which is testament to machine-learning algorithms. As a result, cardiologists of today have substantially reduced the time they spend reading ECG. Now, a half-century later, machine learning for echocardiography image interpretation is on its way. It has taken a long time, but it is here in a big way. Echocardiography is the \u201cheart of cardiology.\u201d It provides digital images of high spatiotemporal resolution that permit machine-directed automated analysis of chamber dimensions, volumes, wall thickness/mass, and wall motion. Automated Doppler jet analysis would allow calculation of pressure gradients and intracardiac pressures. However, the current workflow of echocardiographic examination (30 to 60 min), analysis of images by sonographers (15 to 30 min), and final integration and reporting by cardiologists (10 to 20 min) is a very time-consuming and inefficient process. To this end, automated computer analysis of echocardiographic images will be a most welcome new change (6,7). The next phase would allow automated interpretation of cardiac imaging data, which should lessen or eliminate intraobserver and interobserver variability and reduce cognitive errors. To this end, the study by Narula et al. (1) used an ensemble of a machine-learning framework applied to speckle-tracking echocardiography to differentiate hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) from athlete\u2019s heart. Their study included 77 athletes and 62 HCM patients. The HCM patients were older, whereas the athletes had a larger left ventricle cavity, higher early-to-late diastolic transmitral velocity ratio (E/A), and higher average early diastolic tissue velocity (e\u2032). The machine-learning model based on speckle-tracking echocardiography parameters had an overall diagnostic accuracy essentially similar to that of conventional parameters and revealed that left ventricular volume and mid-left ventricle segmental longitudinal strain were the best discriminators. However, when younger HCM patients were compared with younger athletes, machine learning demonstrated better sensitivity and specificity than standard E/A, e\u2032, and longitudinal strain. What is Machine Learning? For a computer, well-defined, rule-based performance of a repeated task is natural. Machine learning helps computers learn and develop rules by their own methods without having to be instructed every step of the way by human programmers. It uses neural networks to try to simulate how our human brains work. Narula et al. (2) used supervised machine learning (8) with an ensemble of 3 different machine-learning algorithms. This approach entails techniques that create multiple models that are then combined to produce improved results. Such approaches attempt to decipher clinically useful information from noisy cardiac ultrasound motion and deformation data. Deep machine learning is grabbing headlines these days (9). It is made possible by the ever-increasing processing speed of computers. For example, IBM\u2019s Watson Health can process 500 GB\u2014the equivalent of 1 million books\u2014per second; truly a mind-boggling speed! We are entering the field of big data analytics, made possible by fast computing power. The four V\u2019s of big data are volume, variety, velocity, and veracity (10). Big data analytics will certainly have a major impact on all types of cardiovascular imaging analysis and interpretation, as well as integration into clinical decision making (11). Machine learning can reduce cognitive load during image interpretation, and novel cognitive analytics for cardiac imaging recently have been reported (10). Echocardiography use is widespread and continues to increase. A contemporary echocardiographic examination produces vast amounts of data encompassing the morphofunctional hemodynamic status of all 4 chambers and valves, including diastology and advanced myocardial mechanics (strain, strain rate), supplemented by 3-dimensional echocardiography. This could certainly result in cognitive overload, particularly when interpreting multiple echocardiographies. And cognitive overload can lead to costly diagnostic errors. Dedicated training and experience is needed to avoid cognitive errors. Common practice today is to call on the experience and expertise of a senior colleague, a \u201cwise old person,\u201d to help decipher an imaging dilemma. Imaging experts have the ability to efficiently recognize patterns of images and data by immediate recall of extensive stored knowledge in their brains. Machine learning in cardiac imaging would be akin to interacting with a seasoned senior imaging expert (\u201cwise old imager\u201d). This \u201cwise\u201d machine-learned algorithm will be available at any and all times to all users, in particular, those novice readers who are in need of them the most (12). In summary, I admire and congratulate Narula et al. (2) on taking echocardiography into the era of machine-learning automation. Their work symbolizes the type of investigations needed to propel this field. Machine-learning techniques have the potential of wide-scale adoption in echocardiographic applications, from cost-effective screening of athletes to helping with the analysis of complex and challenging cases. Furthermore, developments of such automated systems will reduce interobserver variability and cognitive errors, increase efficiency, and further enhance the value of echocardiography. I eagerly look forward to the day when, upon completion of an echocardiographic examination, a report with chamber measurements, hemodynamics, and preliminary interpretation will be immediately produced for approval by the cardiologist. We are on the cusp of an imaging revolution where the wisdom of an imager is combined with a powerful computer algorithm (machine learning) and, in the words of Einstein, yielding \u201cpower beyond imagination.\u201d The journey has begun!
