Since the implementation of the World Health Organization's Surgical Safety Checklist, their use has become widespread. The aim of this review was to systematically review the state of the literature on surgical safety checklists in neurosurgery. Also, in the new era of robotics and artificial intelligence, there is a need to re-evaluate patient safety procedures in neurosurgery. A systematic review was conducted on PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, and MEDLINE for articles published between 2008 and 2016 using MeSH (medical subject heading) terms and keywords describing postoperative complications and surgical adverse events, and some additional searches were carried out until January 2019. Twenty-six original studies or reviews were eligible for this review. They were categorized into studies with patient-related outcomes, personnel-related outcomes, or previous reviews. Checklist use in neurosurgery was found to reduce hospital-acquired infectious complications and to enhance operating room safety culture. Checklists seem to improve patient safety in neurosurgery, although the amount of evidence is still limited. Despite their shortcomings, checklists are here to stay, and new research is required to update checklists to meet the requirements of the transforming working environment of the neurosurgery operating room.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Neurosurgery"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Patient safety"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Surgical checklist"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Systematic review"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878875019325847", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878875019325847", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85075530780", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85075530780", "pubmed-id": "31589982", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85075530780", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20191004", "$": "2019-10-04"}}}}}
