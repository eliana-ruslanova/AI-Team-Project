In particular, two new methods for association rule discovery and temporal rule discovery are applied to the time series. Such methods exploit several pre-processing techniques, comprising data reduction, multi-scale filtering and temporal abstractions.\n               \n               \n                  Results:\n                  We have analyzed the data of more than 5800 dialysis sessions coming from 43 different patients monitored for 19 months. The qualitative rules associating the outcome parameters and the measured variables were examined by the domain experts, which were able to distinguish between rules confirming available background knowledge and unexpected but plausible rules.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion:\n                  The new methods proposed in the paper are suitable tools for knowledge discovery in clinical time series. Their use in the context of an auditing system for dialysis management helped clinicians to improve their understanding of the patients\u2019 behavior.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Temporal data mining"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hemodialysis"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Rule discovery"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Temporal abstractions"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S093336570400123X", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S093336570400123X", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "18844368769", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-18844368769", "pubmed-id": "15885564", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/18844368769", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20041202", "$": "2004-12-02"}}}}}
