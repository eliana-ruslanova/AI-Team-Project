The known faults in any of the subsystems are often diagnosed by supervised learning algorithms, however, this method fails to work correctly when a new or unknown fault occurs. In such cases an unsupervised learning algorithm becomes essential for obtaining the correct diagnosis. Kernel Fuzzy C-Means (KFCM) is one of the unsupervised algorithms, although it has its own limitations; however in this paper a novel method has been proposed for conditioning of KFCM method (C-KFCM) so that it can be effectively used for fault diagnosis of both known and unknown faults as in satellite reaction wheels. The C-KFCM approach involves determination of exact class centers from the data of known faults, in this way discrete number of fault classes are determined at the start. Similarity parameters are derived and determined for each of the fault data point. Thereafter depending on the similarity threshold each data point is issued with a class label. The high similarity points fall into one of the \u2018known-fault\u2019 classes while the low similarity points are labeled as \u2018unknown-faults\u2019. Simulation results show that as compared to the supervised algorithm such as neural network, the C-KFCM method can effectively cluster historical fault data (as in reaction wheels) and diagnose the faults to an accuracy of more than 91%.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Satellite attitude control system"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Reaction wheel"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Kernel fuzzy c-means clustering"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Similarity"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Fault detection and diagnosis"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Fuzzy clustering"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019057811001200", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019057811001200", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84857045970", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84857045970", "pubmed-id": "22035775", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84857045970", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20111028", "$": "2011-10-28"}}}}}
