To this cause we introduce a second order statistical learning framework for a general class of nonlinear adaptive filters with feedback realized as recurrent neural networks (RNNs). For rigour, both the so-called proper- and improper-second order statistics of complex processes is taken into account, and the proposed augmented complex real-time recurrent learning (ACRTRL) algorithm for RNNs has been shown to be suitable for processing a wide range of both benchmark and real-world complex processes.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Complex nonlinear adaptive filters"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Complex-valued RTRL (CRTRL)"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Augmented Complex Statistics"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608007001670", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608007001670", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "36549043984", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-36549043984", "pubmed-id": "17976955", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/36549043984", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20070922", "$": "2007-09-22"}}}}}
