This paper proposes a new online Extreme Learning Machine (ELM, of Huang et al.) algorithm, namely recursive least mean \n                        p\n                     -power ELM (RLMP-ELM). In RLMP-ELM, a novel error criterion for cost function, namely the least mean \n                        p\n                     -power (LMP) error criterion, provides a mechanism to update the output weights sequentially. The LMP error criterion aims to minimize the mean \n                        p\n                     -power of the error that is the generalization of the mean square error criterion used in the ELM. The proposed on-line learning algorithm is able to provide on-line predictions of variables with noises of different statistics and obtains better performance than ELM and online sequential ELM (OS-ELM) while the non-Gaussian noises impact the processes. Simulations are reported to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed methods.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Recursive least mean \n                        p\n                     -power"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Extreme learning machine"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Online sequential learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Non-Gaussian noises"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Alpha-stable noises"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608017300813", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608017300813", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85018783896", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85018783896", "pubmed-id": "28478371", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85018783896", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20170412", "$": "2017-04-12"}}}}}
