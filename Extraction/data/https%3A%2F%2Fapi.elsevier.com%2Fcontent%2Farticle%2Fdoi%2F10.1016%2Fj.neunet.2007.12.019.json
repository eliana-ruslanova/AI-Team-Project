Owing to the high dimensionality of the NN input vector which is of the order of several hundreds or more, it is rather difficult to cover the entire domain, especially its \u201cfar corners\u201d associated with rare events, even when we use model simulated data for the NN training. Moreover the domain may evolve (e.g.,\u00a0due to climate change). In this situation the emulating NN may be forced to extrapolate beyond its generalization ability and may lead to larger errors in NN outputs. A new technique, a compound parameterization, has been developed to address this problem and to make the NN emulation approach more suitable for long-term climate prediction and climate change projections and other numerical modeling applications. Two different designs of the compound parameterization are presented and discussed.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Neural networks"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Numerical modeling"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Climate"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Weather"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Waves"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Data assimilation"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608007002663", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608007002663", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "40649127675", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-40649127675", "pubmed-id": "18234470", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/40649127675", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20071223", "$": "2007-12-23"}}}}}
