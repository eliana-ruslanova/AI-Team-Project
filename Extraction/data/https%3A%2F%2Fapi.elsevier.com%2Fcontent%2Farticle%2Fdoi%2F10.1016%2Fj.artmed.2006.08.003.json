However, despite the wide range of approaches in the area, in this paper we show that a relevant class of medical data cannot be properly dealt with.\n               \n               \n                  Methodology\n                  We first show that data models based on the \u201cpoint-based\u201d semantics, which is (implicitly or explicitly) assumed by the totality of temporal database approaches, have several limitations when dealing with \u201ctelic\u201d data. We then propose a new model (based on the \u201cinterval-based\u201d semantics) to cope with such data, and extend the query language accordingly.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  We propose a new three-sorted model and a query language to properly deal with both \u201ctelic\u201d and \u201catelic\u201d medical data (as well as non-temporal data). Our query language is flexible, since it allows one to switch from \u201catelic\u201d to \u201ctelic\u201d data, and vice versa.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion\n                  In this paper, we demostrate the feasibilty of a database approach copying with both telic and atelic data as needed in several (medical) applications.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Temporal databases"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Relational data model"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "TSQL2-like query language"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Data semantics"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Telic/atelic clinical data"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0933365706001357", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365706001357", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "33846435761", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-33846435761", "pubmed-id": "17027241", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33846435761", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20061005", "$": "2006-10-05"}}}}}
