In this study we propose a novel model for application in mobile collection schemes - on demand that waste be taken back from household residents. This type of the waste equipment collection is comfortable for residents as they can indicate day and time windows for the take-back. Collecting companies are interested in lowering operational costs required for service. This lowering includes selection of a sufficient number of vehicles and employees, and then minimising the routes\u2019 length in order to achieve savings in fuel consumption, and lowering of emissions. In the proposed model we use a genetic algorithm for optimisation of the route length and number of vehicles and fuzzy logic for representation of the household residents\u2019 satisfaction on the take-back service provided by collection companies. Also, modern communication channels like websites or mobile phone applications can be used to send the waste equipment take-back request from the household, so it has the potential to be developed in future applications. The operation of the model has been presented in the case study of a city in southern Poland. The results can be useful for collecting companies and software producers for preparation of new applications to be used in waste collection.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "WEEE collection"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Fuzzy logic"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Genetic algorithms"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Route optimisation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Customer satisfaction"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956053X16300800", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X16300800", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84977962819", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84977962819", "pubmed-id": "26944864", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84977962819", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20160302", "$": "2016-03-02"}}}}}
