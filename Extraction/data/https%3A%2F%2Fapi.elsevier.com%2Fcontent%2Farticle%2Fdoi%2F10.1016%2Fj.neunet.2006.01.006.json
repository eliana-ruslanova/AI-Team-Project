Such processes are approximated by collections of time dependent non-linear autoregressive models represented by a special kind of neuro-fuzzy neural network. Grid and high throughput computing model mining procedures based on neuro-fuzzy networks and genetic algorithms, generate: (i) collections of models composed of sets of time lag terms from the time series, and (ii) prediction functions represented by neuro-fuzzy networks. The composition of the models and their prediction capabilities, allows the identification of changes in the internal structure of the process. These changes are associated with the alternation of steady and transient states, zones with abnormal behavior, instability, and other situations. This approach is general, and its sensitivity for detecting subtle changes of state is revealed by simulation experiments. Its potential in the study of complex processes in earth sciences and astrophysics is illustrated with applications using paleoclimate and solar data.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Heterogeneous neuron models"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Time dependent neuro-fuzzy-genetic architectures"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Multivariate time series"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Heterogeneous data"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Forecasting and prediction"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Changes of state"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608006000128", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608006000128", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "33646481772", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-33646481772", "pubmed-id": "16537103", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33646481772", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20060314", "$": "2006-03-14"}}}}}
