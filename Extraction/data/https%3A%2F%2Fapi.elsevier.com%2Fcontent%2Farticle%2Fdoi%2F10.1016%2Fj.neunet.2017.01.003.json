Deep convolutional neural networks (DNN) are able to learn and take advantage of local spatial correlations required for this task. They are, however, restricted by their small, fixed-sized filters, which limits their ability to learn long-range dependencies. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), on the other hand, do not suffer from this restriction. Their iterative interpretation allows them to model long-range dependencies by propagating activity. This property is especially useful when labeling video sequences, where both spatial and temporal long-range dependencies occur. In this work, a novel RNN architecture for object class segmentation is presented. We investigate several ways to train such a network. We evaluate our models on the challenging NYU Depth v2 dataset for object class segmentation and obtain competitive results.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Recurrent neural networks"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Computer vision"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Object class-segmentation"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608017300035", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608017300035", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85013301363", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85013301363", "pubmed-id": "28232260", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85013301363", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20170130", "$": "2017-01-30"}}}}}
