In plant breeding, phenotyping of genotypes is realized by time consuming and expensive visual plant ratings. During resistance reactions and during pathogenesis plants initiate different structural and biochemical defence mechanisms, which partly affect the optical properties of plant organs. Recently, intensive research has been conducted to develop innovative optical methods for an assessment of compatible and incompatible plant pathogen interaction. These approaches, combining classical phytopathology or microbiology with technology driven methods \u2014 such as sensors, robotics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence \u2014 are summarized by the term digital phenotyping. In contrast to common visual rating, detection and assessment methods, optical sensors in combination with advanced data analysis methods are able to retrieve pathogen induced changes in the physiology of susceptible or resistant plants non-invasively and objectively. Phenotyping disease resistance aims different tasks. In an early breeding step, a qualitative assessment and characterization of specific resistance action is aimed to link it, for example, to a genetic marker. Later, during greenhouse and field screening, the assessment of the level of susceptibility of different genotypes is relevant. Within this review, recent advances of digital phenotyping technologies for the detection of subtle resistance reactions and resistance breeding are highlighted and methodological requirements are critically discussed.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1369526618301092", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369526618301092", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85069981840", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85069981840", "pubmed-id": "31387067", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85069981840", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20190803", "$": "2019-08-03"}}}}}
