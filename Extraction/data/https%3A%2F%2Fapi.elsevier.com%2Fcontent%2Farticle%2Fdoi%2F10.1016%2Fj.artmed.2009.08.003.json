Although a significant amount of research efforts have been dedicated to simulating the behaviours of soft tissues, modelling of soft tissue deformation is still a challenging problem. This paper presents a new deformable model for simulation of soft tissue deformation from the electromechanical viewpoint of soft tissues.\n               \n               \n                  Methods and material\n                  Soft tissue deformation is formulated as a reaction\u2013diffusion process coupled with a mechanical load. The mechanical load applied to a soft tissue to cause a deformation is incorporated into the reaction\u2013diffusion system, and consequently distributed among mass points of the soft tissue. Reaction\u2013diffusion of mechanical load and non-rigid mechanics of motion are combined to govern the simulation dynamics of soft tissue deformation.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  An improved reaction\u2013diffusion model is developed to describe the distribution of the mechanical load in soft tissues. A three-layer artificial cellular neural network is constructed to solve the reaction\u2013diffusion model for real-time simulation of soft tissue deformation. A gradient based method is established to derive internal forces from the distribution of the mechanical load. Integration with a haptic device has also been achieved to simulate soft tissue deformation with haptic feedback.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  The proposed methodology does not only predict the typical behaviours of living tissues, but it also accepts both local and large-range deformations. It also accommodates isotropic, anisotropic and inhomogeneous deformations by simple modification of diffusion coefficients.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Reaction\u2013diffusion"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial neural network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Haptic feedback"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Soft tissue deformation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Surgery simulation"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0933365709001316", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365709001316", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "70350735951", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-70350735951", "pubmed-id": "19819116", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/70350735951", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20091009", "$": "2009-10-09"}}}}}
