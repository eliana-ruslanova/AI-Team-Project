The experimental data reported in a previous study were used to build the neural network. The ANN was trained using the back propagation algorithm. The ANN predicted values showed good agreement with the experimentally reported ones from a response surface based experiment. The concentrations of three medium components: viz Tween 80, sucrose and K2HPO4 served as inputs to the neural network model and the enzyme activity as the output of the model. A model was generated with a coefficient of correlation (R\n                     2) of 1.0 for the training set and 0.90 for the test data. A genetic algorithm was used to optimize the input space of the neural network model to find the optimum settings for maximum enzyme activity. This artificial neural network supported genetic algorithm predicted a maximum glucansucrase activity of 6.92U/ml at medium composition of 0.54% (v/v) Tween 80, 5.98% (w/v) sucrose and 1.01% (w/v) K2HPO4. ANN\u2013GA predicted model gave a 6.0% increase of enzyme activity over the regression based prediction for optimized enzyme activity. The maximum enzyme activity experimentally obtained using the ANN\u2013GA designed medium was 6.75\u00b10.09U/ml which was in good agreement with the predicted value.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Glucansucrase"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial neural network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Genetic algorithm"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Media optimization"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "\n                     Leuconostoc dextranicum\n                  "}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960852408002423", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960852408002423", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "47749090544", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-47749090544", "pubmed-id": "18440808", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/47749090544", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20080428", "$": "2008-04-28"}}}}}
