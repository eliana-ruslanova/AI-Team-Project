Abstract Introduction Supervised record linkage methods often require a clerical review to gain informative training data. Active learning means to actively prompt the user to label data with special characteristics in order to minimise the review costs. We conducted an empirical evaluation to investigate whether a simple active learning strategy using binary comparison patterns is sufficient or if string metrics together with a more sophisticated algorithm are necessary to achieve high accuracies with a small training set. Material and Methods Based on medical registry data with different numbers of attributes, we used active learning to acquire training sets for classification trees, which were then used to classify the remaining data. Active learning for binary patterns means that every distinct comparison pattern represents a stratum from which one item is sampled. Active learning for patterns consisting of the Levenshtein string metric values uses an iterative process where the most informative and representative examples are added to the training set. In this context, we extended the active learning strategy by Sarawagi and Bhamidipaty (2002) [6]. Results On the original data set, active learning based on binary comparison patterns leads to the best results. When dropping four or six attributes, using string metrics leads to better results. In both cases, not more than 200 manually reviewed training examples are necessary. Conclusions In record linkage applications where only forename, name and birthday are available as attributes, we suggest the sophisticated active learning strategy based on string metrics in order to achieve highly accurate results. We recommend the simple strategy if more attributes are available, as in our study. In both cases, active learning significantly reduces the amount of manual involvement in training data selection compared to usual record linkage settings. Keywords Medical record linkage Active learning Bagging 1 Background Data deduplication refers to the process in which records referring to the same real-world entities are detected in data sets such that duplicates can be eliminated. The denotation record linkage is used here for the same problem [1]. Record linkage is generally applied whenever medical data about one patient needs to be linked with the same patient\u2019s data from other sources, particularly in regards to biomedical databases such as disease registries or a Master Patient Index (a unique index in a central database that enables the identification of multiple records belonging to one patient across several heterogeneous databases). Record linkage is especially relevant for establishing a unique patient database for national and international researchers (see for example [2]). In every record linkage setting, manual involvement is necessary in order to calibrate the methods to the special setting, even when no labelled training data (a set of record pairs for which it is known whether they represent the same entity or not) are necessary as in [3]. Especially in settings without sophisticated means to acquire training data, frequently thousands of records are examined in order to obtain labelled training data (with labels match or non-match for pairs of records that represent the same or different entities) that represent all relevant cases. Let us illustrate this by the following thought experiment: We would like to search for duplicates in a large data set with eight attributes. If we use binary comparisons (equal or non-equal) between the attributes, the number of possible distinct comparison patterns (i.e. the attribute-wise similarity of two records; see the introduction for an example) is 28 =256. We want to select a training set by randomly sampling from all available record pairs such that every comparison pattern present is represented at least once in the training data; this guarantees that every pattern can be classified directly. Under the assumption that all comparison patterns have equal frequency, we would need to draw 2 n \u00b7 \u2211 i = 0 2 n - 1 1 2 n - i pairs on average (1568 for n =8 as in our example). In reality though, non-matches usually outweigh matches. For example, a data set of 100,000 records can have at most 50,000 matches among the 100,000*(100,000\u22121)/2 possible record pairs. This leads to low probabilities for some comparison patterns; thus, the data to be processed in order to cover all patterns increases dramatically. The thought experiment gives a hint as to why randomly sampled training sets seldom cover all comparison patterns and, hence, why in this case it is necessary to extract a large number of record pairs in order to gain a representative subset of all comparison patterns, even in a setting with binary comparisons. Our goal is to find an approach that reduces the number of training samples necessary for method calibration and makes the process of acquiring a training set more cost-efficient in two aspects: First, fewer training samples require less manual review (i.e. labelling by documentation specialists) in order to be classified. Second, in scenarios where personal data is usually encrypted, the risk of a data breach and the costs associated with decrypting records are minimised. 2 Introduction This paper intends to foster the adoption of active learning, a machine learning method with practical relevance, into the field of medical record linkage and, beyond that, into medical classification problems in general. In settings where a priori information is not available, active learning delivers a usable and cost-efficient (see above) training data selection method (i.e. a rule that selects record pairs to be labelled). An example of a realistic and problematic record linkage task regarding personal data is given below with the following attributes: first name and last name (two components each), sex, date of birth (comprised of day, month and year) and postal code. (( \u2018Peter\u2019, \u2019John\u2019, \u2018Branket\u2019, , \u2018m\u2019, \u201911\u2019, \u201810\u2019, \u20191971\u2019, \u2019100098\u2019 ) ( \u2018Peter\u2019, , \u2018Blanket\u2019, , \u2018m\u2019, \u201901\u2019, \u201910\u2019, \u20191971\u2019, \u201910098\u2019 )) This leads to the binary comparison pattern ( 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 ) and to a comparison pattern using the Levenshtein string metric (see next section) as ( 1 , 0 , 0.857 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0.5 , 1 , 0.833 ) . Comparisons on missing values are encoded as 0. A justification for this approach is given in [4]. A frequently used stochastic framework for record linkage is formulated by Fellegi and Sunter [5] (refered to as stochastic or probabilistic record linkage), but non-probabilistic methods from the machine learning domain are becoming more and more relevant. See the literature survey of Elmagarmid et al. [1] for an overview of several stochastic and non-stochastic deduplication methods. We used Classification and Regression Trees (CART) \u2013 see Section 3 \u2013 to decide if the underlying records of a comparison pattern represent the same or different entities (designated as match and non-match, respectively). When applying supervised classification methods to record linkage, the acquisition of appropriate training data is crucial. Supervised classification makes use of a set of training examples for which the outcome variable (match or non-match in this case) is known, in order to infer rules to classify unlabelled data. Ways for obtaining labelled training data include, for example, the generation of artificial data, making use of data from different but similar contexts, or a manual review of a selection from the data to be linked. To get an informative training set of minimal size from the data on hand, we regard active learning as suitable, a machine learning approach where the user is asked to label data with special characteristics (i.e. high information gain according to some measure). In [6], an intuitive example regarding the spirit of active learning is given. We compared two active learning strategies based on two different types of comparison patterns in order to give hints as to whether a simple active learning strategy on binary comparison patterns is sufficient for enabling sound record linkage performance (i.e. with acceptable error rates), or if comparison patterns based on string metrics (which measure the similarity of two character strings) together with a more sophisticated active learning are necessary to achieve this goal. In the case of comparison patterns consisting of string metric values, we used the following algorithm for training data selection. 2.1 General algorithm for active learning Input: Labelled Training data T, Unlabelled Training data UT, Calibration method C, Model M. While not (stopping criteria): 1. Apply C to M on training data T achieved so far and get M\u2032. 2. For each item u in UT compute Information score I using M\u2032. 3. Select one or more Items in UT with the highest I values; remove them from UT and add them to T after a manual labelling. Output: Classifier calibrated with the final T. This algorithm, which is presented by Sarawagi and Bhamidipaty [6], is extended in this article (see Section 3.3). The Information score I measures how informative a training example is. Common strategies (called query strategies by Sarawagi and Bhamidipaty) to compute the information score are uncertainty sampling, where the uncertainty of a given classifier for every unlabelled item is determined, and query by committee, where the disagreement of several models is computed (also see [7]). Several papers that study active learning in the context of record linkage exist. The article by Sarawagi and Bhamidipaty mentioned above lacks information regarding random variations of the results due to random sampling in the query strategy; furthermore, only validation sets with a moderate number of items (<100,000) are considered. Arasu et al. [8] use active learning to learn linear and threshold classifiers for the identification of objects; their approach is based on restrictive monotony assumptions. Tejada and Michalowski [9\u201311] deploy an object identification system for linking information from different web sites. They apply active learning in combination with string transformations and secondary sources such as geocoding. Another approach that uses a similar active learning method for object identification but in a genetic programming setting is presented by de Freitas et al. [12]. Instead of investigating the disagreement on aggregated and transformed attribute values as in [6], we used the original attribute values, which can reduce biases caused by aggregated measures, facilitates the assurance that the resulting training data consists of representative cases, and enables us to consider a simple active learning strategy for binary comparison patterns. The paper has four contributions: First, it uses active learning for record linkage in a medical domain on a large data set. Second, it compares a simple active learning strategy with a more sophisticated strategy. Third, it extends the method of computing the information score in [6] based on theoretical grounds. Fourth, it delivers insights into the variations of the results due to random sampling in the active learning strategies. 3 Material and methods 3.1 Data Our data (comparison patterns) are based on 100,000 cancer registry patient records that were collected between 2006 and 2008 and include the matching attributes listed in Table I . The class labels (match or non-match) were determined by an extensive manual review of the underlying record pairs during a mandatory evaluation of the registry and acted as the gold standard in our evaluations. As a result of natural and local capacity restrictions concerning memory and computation, blocking was used. Blocking reduces the number of record pairs through the imposition of conditions (e.g. phonetic code of the first component of the first name and day of birth must be equal) for filtering out irrelevant record pairs. Six blocking iterations with different conditions were run in order to account for possible errors in the blocking variables. The resulting set of record pairs (and therefore comparison patterns) consists of 5728,201 non-matches and 20,931 matches. We have published the corresponding comparison patterns and details about their generation in the UCI Machine Learning Repository [14,15]. For further details, such as the data source, the blocking strategy and the review process, please refer to that source. We used binary comparison patterns as well as patterns with string metric values as components. The string metric values were computed by using the Levenshtein distance d between two strings v and w, giving the following string metric: (1) s ( v , w ) = 1 - d ( v , w ) max ( length ( v ) ,length ( w ) ) See [16,17] and especially [18,19] for an empirical justification that there is no relevant difference in a record linkage evaluation between the usage of the Levenshtein metric and, for instance, the Jaro-Winkler string metric (particularly for relatively short strings as in our data; also see [20]). 3.2 Classification trees For the classification of record pairs as match or non-match, we used classification trees as provided by the R-package \u2019rpart\u2019, an implementation of the method CART (Classification and Regression Trees; see [21,22]). The first applications of classification trees for the solution of the record linkage problem are presented by [23,24]. Other papers that exploit classification trees for record linkage are for example [6,11,25]. A comprehensive introduction is given by [21]. For the usage of CART in record linkage using R, we refer to our package [26] and a previous paper [27]. In [27], we deliver example code for performing record linkage in R. Therefore, we refer to that resource for reconstructions. Two classification trees that are based on training data achieved by our active learning strategies are displayed in Fig. 1 (for binary comparison patterns) and Fig. 2 (for comparison patterns based on the Levenshtein string metric). The possible outcomes are denoted as \u201cL\u201d for \u201dlink\u201d (patterns that are classified as matches) and \u201cN\u201d for \u201cnon-link\u201d (patterns that are classified as non-matches). The terms link and non-link are used in order to distinguish the classification result from the real matching status (the property match or non-match). The bold branches in the plotted trees indicate the paths on which the example record pair given in the introduction is processed, leading to classification as a non-link in the binary case and as a link in the string metric case. Weighted aggregations of classification trees can be used for improving and stabilizing their performance. One ensemble method we exploit for active learning is Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating), which is introduced in [28]. This method generates bootstrap samples from the entire training data set and aggregates decisions of the generated classification trees \u2013 here induced through cart \u2013 via majority vote. The R-Package ipred [29] implements bagging. 3.3 Active learning strategies and evaluation cases In the evaluations, the simple classification trees used for classification were generated with parameters such that the maximal depth was (nearly) achieved (for further details see [30]). The following two active learning strategies were run 50 times in order to account for variance due to random sampling (we did not need to label the data because we used the gold standard, but the practitioner without a priori information must of course label the data selected in the active learning strategies). 3.3.1 ABIN ABIN: Active learning for binary patterns. Each distinct comparison pattern represents a stratum to which all identical patterns belong; from every stratum, one item is randomly sampled. As every stratum consists of the same patterns, the difference in different samplings is only related to the matching status of the patterns in the resulting training data. If, for example, the pattern ( 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 ) occurs 200 times as match and 1000 times as non-match, then with probability 1/6, it appears as match in the training data and with probability 5/6 as non-match. 3.3.2 ASTR ASTR: Active learning for patterns consisting of the Levenshtein string metric values. The initial training set consists of two items with maximum and minimum agreement respectively, for which it is assumed that they represent one match and one non-match. In each iteration of the active learning algorithm, bagging is used to generate 50 different classification trees, which are used to determine the entropy of every comparison pattern not included in the training set. One new training pattern is then selected by random sampling from the population of unlabelled patterns, weighted by their entropy as determined in the bagging step (see below). When all unlabelled training data have entropy value zero (which is especially likely at the outset of the active learning iteration due to the simplicity of the classification tree that is generated on few training data), the next pattern is sampled according to the uniform probability distribution. The stopping criterion is the maximal number of manual classified items, 200, which is in the same magnitude as the number of patterns in the ABIN case and large enough so that for most of the 50 runs, stabilization of the accuracy (quantified by the F-measure, see Section 3.4) at high levels occurs (i.e. no significant improvement is expected for a higher number of training data). If no stabilization at a high level is achieved, the evaluation case is regarded as an outlier (see Section 4). The comparison pattern ( 1 , 0 , 0.857 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0.5 , 1 , 0.833 ) is likely to be sampled in the active learning iteration process because of the highly different similarity values it contains. Nevertheless, due to the randomness of the sampling in the active learning strategy, there is no guarantee that this comparison pattern will be part of the training data. The entropy values of the N =50 bagged classification trees in the strategy ASTR are computed as: (2) E ( p 1 , \u2026 , p N ) = - 1 N \u2211 i = 1 N p i log 2 1 N \u2211 i = 1 N p i - 1 N \u2211 i = 1 N ( 1 - p i ) log 2 1 N \u2211 i = 1 N 1 - p i where pi is the probability that a pattern represents a match according to classification tree i. This probability is determined by the ratio of matches among the training patterns that end up in the respective leaf. Using this formula, we have extended the method developed by Sarawagi and Bhamidipaty [6], who compute the entropy on the fraction of classifiers that predict each of the two classes. Our formula takes into account the uncertainty with which each of the 50 classifications is made. Cases such as the following are thereby avoided: all trees classify a pattern as match with class probability near 0.5; uncertainty is almost at the maximum but the method of [6] would assess that pattern as a certain match. In order to asses the impact of the number of attributes to the matching results, two runs of the active learning strategies with reduced numbers of attributes were conducted. In the first run, the second components of forename and name, sex and postal code were dropped. In the second run, day and month of birth were additionally omitted. In the following, the corresponding cases are denoted ABIN4D, ABIN6D, ASTR4D and ASTR6D. Table 2 gives an overview of the characteristics of the six evaluation cases. 3.4 Outcome measures Outcomes of a record linkage procedure are designated as links and non-links. Links and non-links follow from classifying record pairs as respectively representing matches and non-matches. Due to the imbalance between matches and non-matches, the accuracy is not very informative as an absolute measure, though it is still useful for comparisons concerning the search for the strategy with the least aggregated error rate. Instead, we use the F-measure F (also called F-score or F1 score), which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall (see for example [6]): (3) F = 2 \u00b7 precision \u00b7 recall precison + recall Recall (also called sensitivity) is computed as the fraction of correct links among all matches. Precision is the fraction of correct links among all links. The F-measure combines accuracy and comprehensiveness concerning the detection of matches. The aim of using the F-measure lies in comparability: the number of non-matches is not fixed and is, for example, dependent on the blocking procedure. The F-measure guarantees independence of such non-essential variability and nevertheless captures the relevant part of the classification (capability of finding all but not more matches). Regarding the significance of the F-measure differences between the active learning strategies, we used the Wilcoxon rank sum test (see for example [31]), which is a non-parametrical statistical procedure that allows median comparisons when values are drawn from non-normal distributions. Further, concerning the ABIN cases (ABIN, ABIN4D, ABIN6D), we present the number of training data and boxplots of the F-measures here. Regarding the ASTR-cases (ASTR, ASTR4D, ASTR6D), plots of the F-measures against the number of thus far manually classified training samples are given. In the latter case, the minimum, median and maximum of the F-measures for every number of training samples in the 50 runs constitute the points for three curves that are depicted in the plots. In these plots, two vertical lines were added: one indicating the iteration after which the median F-measure values do not vary more than 0.02 (a stabilization criterion based on the inspection of the F-measure curves) and another indicating the number of training data in the corresponding binary case (i.e. the binary case with the same number of attributes). 4 Results The number of training data for ABIN, ABIN4D and ABIN6D are 167, 32 and 8, respectively. Fig. 3 shows the results for the binary cases. In order to improve the readability of the boxplots, we consider only values \u2a7e0.95, thereby excluding three outliers (these are discussed below). The omission of the four attributes cmp_fname_c2, cmp_lname_c2, cmp_sex and cmp_plz leads to significantly worse results compared to non-omission. The differences between ABIN to ABIN4D and ABIN4D to ABIN6D are highly significant (p-values<0.1\u00d710\u221210). Even the lower outliers are greater than the maximal F-measure values of the cases with fewer attributes. Regarding ABIN6D, three types of classification trees are induced: 47 of the 50 trees come down to the deterministic strategy \u2018classify a comparison pattern as match if cmp_fname_c1=1, cmp_lname_c1=1 and cmp_by=1, otherwise as non-match\u2019. These correspond with training sets with exactly one match for the comparison pattern (1,1,1) and yield the highest F-score (0.980) in the ABIN6D case. In two cases, equality of cmp_fname_c1 and cmp_lname_c1 is sufficient to classify a pattern as match; the training sets contain two matches with comparison patterns (1,1,0) and (1,1,1). The F-score is significantly lower in this case (0.793). One extreme outlier is caused by the rare but possible event that all training pairs, even the one with maximal agreement (1,1,1), represent non-matches. This leads to a degenerated tree that classifies all patterns as non-match; as a consequence, the F-score is 0. These observations illustrate that a decreasing number of attributes increases the chance of obtaining a weak classifier because of the reduced distinctiveness of the data. ABIN and ABIN4D have enough attributes to make such outliers highly improbable. Figs. 4\u20136 display the results for the string metric cases. The plots show that only in the ASTR case is the stabilization point of the median F-measures achieved on a smaller number of training data than the one yielded in the corresponding binary case. In the other two cases, the number of training data yielded in the corresponding binary case is considerably smaller compared to the stabilization points. Differences between ASTR and (ASTR4D, ASTR6D) can further be detected concerning the median and minimum curves. Whereas the minimum curve of ASTR stabilises early at a very low level due to eight runs that remain at that level (see below), the minimum curves of the other cases reach high F-measure levels and show much more variation. The median curve of the ASTR case reaches the maximum curve at the end of the iteration process, in contrast to ASTR4D and ASTR6D, where the median curves come close to the maximum curves early. In contrast to the binary cases, the difference of the F-measure values between ASTR and ASTR4D at the end of the iteration are not significant (p-value: 0.791). The difference between the binary and string metrics case in this respect can be ascribed to the higher distinctiveness of the (quasi-) continuous ASTR4D comparison patterns in relation to the ABIN4D case, which can compensate for the omission of attributes. Dropping six attributes cannot be compensated and so at the end of the iteration process, the result in ASTR6D is significantly worse than in ASTR (p-values<0.5\u00d710\u22125). The most striking outcome is that ABIN exhibits significantly better results than ASTR (and ASTR4D) at the end of the iteration process (p-values<0.1\u00d710\u221210), and hence, classification trees based on the full set of binary comparison attributes is the best method on our data. There are two main reasons for this result: First, the number of attributes is sufficient to get high discrimination power in the binary case without the necessity of fine-tuning, as is necessary for the split-values in the string metric case; second, ASTR reveals eight outliers. This means that the active learning strategy we use is not able to prevent degenerated classification trees on the full set of comparison attributes. Concretely, all eight outliers are caused by the selection of cmp_lname_c2 as the split attribute with split value p near 0.5. Only when a non-match with a cmp_lname_c2 value near one or a match with a cmp_lname_c2 value near zero is selected, the training data is not solely separable by cmp_lname_c2. However, the entropy values of comparison patterns with a cmp_lname_c2 value near p are the highest ones, and the prevalent non-matches have predominantly a zero value in that attribute: hence, the likelihood of selecting a training example that confirms the structure of the degenerated classification tree is highly probable in the active learning strategy. In general, it seems relevant for our active learning strategy in the string metric case that no single comparison attribute is highly correlated with the matching status in order to guarantee stable results on a high level (stable results are more likely for ASTR4D without losing considerable accuracy). For the reduced sets of comparison attributes, the string metric cases exhibit significantly higher results at the end of the iteration process compared to the corresponding binary cases (p-values<0.1\u00d710\u221210). When using the number of training data in the binary case for the string metric case as well, the string metric cases are significantly worse than the corresponding binary cases. In real-world applications a manual review of two hundred data should be regarded as feasible, and we therefore regard the string metric case as superior to the binary case when the attribute set is reduced. 5 Discussion The major steps in the scientific field of deduplication or record linkage have already been taken. New insights are more likely to occur in respect to improving efficiency than in respect to contriving ways of improving accuracies, this work being an example. Confining oneself to binary comparison patterns and a simple active learning strategy necessitates only 167 data to be manually reviewed in order to achieve the overall best results on our data. Binary comparison patterns can be generated from pseudonymised data, and hence, data security requirements can be met as well. In addition, choosing the binary strategy simplifies the data (i.e. comparison pair) generation and training process. But if high-quality data is necessary and less than six informative (large number of distinctive values) attributes are available, then a sophisticated active learning strategy on string metric data should be taken into consideration. It is remarkable that with the original attributes, the binary strategy outperforms the active learning strategy on string metric data; we had expected that the former strategy would at most be equal to the latter one due to the increased distinctiveness of comparison patterns based on string metrics. The problem of generalising results based on special data and experiments should be born in mind. In this regard, our data set has one advantage: It represents the real outcome of a typical medical registry, and so observations based on these data are likely to hold for other medical registries with similar attributes. A more serious problem is related to the manual review in the active learning strategies: If the original data cannot be consulted, a manual review of the comparison patterns does not have more potential to identify the real matching status than computerised algorithms. Remedies to this situation could include consulting the matching status of data from similar settings with the same comparison patterns or the application of semi-supervised methods such as multiview learning which are calibrated on similar data (for more on these methods see [32] and [33]). Extensions to our evaluation could be the consideration of further classification methods such as support vector machines or logistic regression and the improvement of active learning strategies by using new query algorithms (for example, based on the interdependence of the attributes). Again, the same holds as stated before: We do not expect relevant accuracy enhancements, but there is still a potential to increase efficiency in terms of costs for conducting record linkage. 6 Conclusion In record linkage applications where only forename, name and birthday are available as attributes, we suggest the sophisticated active learning strategy based on string metrics to achieve highly accurate results. In many applications, these attributes are deemed sufficient for enabling good record linkage performance (i.e. with acceptable error rates). We recommend the simple strategy if more attributes are available as in our study. Hence, one should not a priori discard the opportunity of obtaining more attributes than deemed necessary. In both cases, active learning significantly reduces the amount of manual involvement in training data selection compared to the usual record linkage settings. References [1] A.K. Elmagarmid P.G.

Active learning means to actively prompt the user to label data with special characteristics in order to minimise the review costs. We conducted an empirical evaluation to investigate whether a simple active learning strategy using binary comparison patterns is sufficient or if string metrics together with a more sophisticated algorithm are necessary to achieve high accuracies with a small training set. Material and Methods Based on medical registry data with different numbers of attributes, we used active learning to acquire training sets for classification trees, which were then used to classify the remaining data. Active learning for binary patterns means that every distinct comparison pattern represents a stratum from which one item is sampled. Active learning for patterns consisting of the Levenshtein string metric values uses an iterative process where the most informative and representative examples are added to the training set. In this context, we extended the active learning strategy by Sarawagi and Bhamidipaty (2002) [6]. Results On the original data set, active learning based on binary comparison patterns leads to the best results. When dropping four or six attributes, using string metrics leads to better results. In both cases, not more than 200 manually reviewed training examples are necessary. Conclusions In record linkage applications where only forename, name and birthday are available as attributes, we suggest the sophisticated active learning strategy based on string metrics in order to achieve highly accurate results. We recommend the simple strategy if more attributes are available, as in our study.
