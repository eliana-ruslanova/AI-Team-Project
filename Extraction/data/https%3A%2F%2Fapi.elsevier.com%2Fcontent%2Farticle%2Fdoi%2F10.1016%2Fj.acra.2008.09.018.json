Three physicians evaluated single images at B-mode and arterial phases with a cine mode. Physicians were asked to classify each lesion into one of eight B-mode and one of eight enhancement patterns, but did not make a diagnosis. To classify five types of FLLs, we employed a decision tree model with four decision nodes and four artificial neural networks (ANNs). The results of the physicians' pattern classifications were used successively for four different ANNs in making decisions at each of the decision nodes in the decision tree model.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  The classification accuracies for the 137 FLLs were 84.8% for metastasis, 93.3% for hemangioma, and 98.6% for all HCCs. In addition, the classification accuracies for histological differentiation types of HCCs were 65.2% for well-differentiated HCC, 41.7% for moderately differentiated HCC, and 80.0% for poorly differentiated HCC.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  This CAD scheme has the potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy of liver lesions. However, the accuracy in the histologic differential diagnosis of HCC based on baseline and contrast-enhanced US is still limited.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Contrast-enhanced sonography"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "computer-aided diagnosis"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "focal liver lesion"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Sonazoid"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1076633208005771", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1076633208005771", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "61649085716", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-61649085716", "pubmed-id": "19268851", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/61649085716", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20090305", "$": "2009-03-05"}}}}}
