In this study, application of a 10 state ergodic hidden Markov model (HMM)/artificial neural network (ANN) hybrid structure for a dysarthric speech (isolated word) recognition system, intended to act as an assistive tool, was investigated. A small size vocabulary spoken by three cerebral palsy subjects was chosen. The effect of such a structure on the recognition rate of the system was investigated by comparing it with an ergodic hidden Markov model as a control tool. This was done in order to determine if this modified technique contributed to enhanced recognition of dysarthric speech. The speech was sampled at 11kHz. Mel frequency cepstral coefficients were extracted from them using 15ms frames and served as training input to the hybrid model setup. The subsequent results demonstrated that the hybrid model structure was quite robust in its ability to handle the large variability and non-conformity of dysarthric speech. The level of variability in input dysarthric speech patterns sometimes limits the reliability of the system. However, its application as a rehabilitation/control tool to assist dysarthric motor impaired individuals holds sufficient promise.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial neural network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Cerebral palsy"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Dysarthric speech"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Ergodic model"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hidden Markov model"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Mel frequency cepstral coefficients"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Speech recognition"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1350453305002444", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350453305002444", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "33744999820", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-33744999820", "pubmed-id": "16359906", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33744999820", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20051215", "$": "2005-12-15"}}}}}
