Abstract Introduction It has become clear that noise generated during the assay and analytical processes has the ability to disrupt accurate interpretation of genomic studies. Not only does such noise impact the scientific validity and costs of studies, but when assessed in the context of clinically translatable indications such as phenotype prediction, it can lead to inaccurate conclusions that could ultimately impact patients. We applied a sequence of ranking methods to damp noise associated with microarray outputs, and then tested the utility of the approach in three disease indications using publically available datasets. Materials and methods This study was performed in three phases. We first theoretically analyzed the effect of noise in phenotype prediction problems showing that it can be expressed as a modeling error that partially falsifies the pathways. Secondly, via synthetic modeling, we performed the sensitivity analysis for the main gene ranking methods to different types of noise. Finally, we studied the predictive accuracy of the gene lists provided by these ranking methods in synthetic data and in three different datasets related to cancer, rare and neurodegenerative diseases to better understand the translational aspects of our findings. Results and discussion In the case of synthetic modeling, we showed that Fisher\u2019s Ratio (FR) was the most robust gene ranking method in terms of precision for all the types of noise at different levels. Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) provided slightly lower performance and the rest of the methods (fold change, entropy and maximum percentile distance) were much less precise and accurate. The predictive accuracy of the smallest set of high discriminatory probes was similar for all the methods in the case of Gaussian and Log-Gaussian noise. In the case of class assignment noise, the predictive accuracy of SAM and FR is higher. Finally, for real datasets (Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Inclusion Body Myositis and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) we found that FR and SAM provided the highest predictive accuracies with the smallest number of genes. Biological pathways were found with an expanded list of genes whose discriminatory power has been established via FR. Conclusions We have shown that noise in expression data and class assignment partially falsifies the sets of discriminatory probes in phenotype prediction problems. FR and SAM better exploit the principle of parsimony and are able to find subsets with less number of high discriminatory genes. The predictive accuracy and the precision are two different metrics to select the important genes, since in the presence of noise the most predictive genes do not completely coincide with those that are related to the phenotype. Based on the synthetic results, FR and SAM are recommended to unravel the biological pathways that are involved in the disease development. Keywords Noise analysis Machine learning Gene expression Cancer genomics 1 Introduction The revolution in molecular biology and the development of high-throughput technologies for sequencing in genetic and genomic analyses has generated an explosion in the amount of genetic data. These technologies, which have been firstly applied in research, are now increasingly applied in translational medicine. Particularly, gene expression analysis through hybridization microarrays or RNA sequencing is now a conventional component in many areas of biomedical research. This kind of experiments has a very high under-determined character since the number of samples (patients) is much lower than the number of monitored probes (genes). Therefore, gene-ranking methods are needed to establish the discriminatory power of the genes in the phenotype prediction. In this paper we first theoretically analyzed the effect of noise in phenotype prediction problems by casting them into abstract optimization problems. To accomplish this, we first show that noise in data can be expressed as a modeling error that partially falsifies the set of discriminatory probes that are phenotype-related, and therefore the biological pathways that are involved. Secondly, the sensitivity to different kind of noise (in expression and class assignment) for the main gene ranking methods (Fold Change, Fisher\u2019s Ratio, Percentile Distance and Entropy) compared to well-established Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) [1] is performed via synthetic microarray modeling. This analysis has shown that in general terms Fisher\u2019s ratio is the most robust method in terms of precision closely followed by SAM. Besides, both methods provided the smallest sets with the highest discriminatory power. The effect of noise increases the number of genetic probes that are needed to slightly improve the predictive accuracy. Therefore, an optimum method to find the biological pathways in translational problems will consist of ranking the differential expressed genes decreasingly by their corresponding Fisher\u2019s ratio. The results of these analyses are confirmed using three different datasets concerning the study of cancer (Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia), rare diseases (Inclusion Body Myositis) and neurodegenerative diseases (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis). We found that FR and SAM provide the highest predictive accuracies with the smallest number of genes, exploiting the principle of parsimony. Besides, we show their corresponding biological found with an expanded list of genes whose discriminatory power has been established via FR. In these three cases, the effect of viral infections in the corresponding pathways is clear. We demonstrated that applying a proper ranking method the influence of noise in microarray expression dataset and the corresponding error in the classification induced by the different sources of noise can be reduced. Similarly to the analysis shown in this paper, Lorena et al. [2] have studied the particular characteristics of cancer gene expression data mostly impact the prediction ability of support vector machine classifiers. We expect that the results of this analysis will help optimize the use of these methods in translational medicine, particularly in the biological understanding of different diseases and in drug optimization problems. 2 Material and methods 2.1 The effect of noise in phenotype prediction One of the main obstacles in the analysis of genomic data is the absence of a conceptual model that relates the different genes/probes to the class prediction (phenotype). Machine-learning algorithms are therefore needed to model these complex relationships. For this reason, a classifier L \u2217 ( g ) has to be constructed and it is defined as an application between the set of genetic signatures g and the set of classes C = { c 1 , c 2 , \u2026 , c n } in which the phenotype is divided: (1) L \u2217 ( g ) : g \u2208 R s \u2192 C = { c 1 , c 2 , \u2026 , c n } where s is the number of genetic probes that have been monitored. In most cases, the classification problem involved is binary. The machine learning procedure is composed of two stages: 1. The learning process, that consists in giving a subset of samples T (training data set) whose class vector is known, c obs , finding the subset of genetic signatures g that maximizes the learning accuracy, that is, the number of samples whose class is correctly predicted. This can be written as the result of the following optimization problem: (2) O ( g \u223c ) = min g \u2208 R s O ( g ) , O ( g ) = \u2016 L \u2217 ( g ) - c obs \u2016 p , L \u2217 ( g ) = ( L \u2217 ( g 1 ) , \u2026 , L \u2217 ( g m ) ) , where L \u2217 ( g ) is the set of predicted classes, g i is the genetic signature corresponding to the sample i in the training dataset T , and \u2016 L \u2217 ( g ) - c obs \u2016 p stands for the distance between the predicted (L*(g)) and observed classes cobs in T. For instance if the vector of classes c obs is composed of two consecutive class indexes { 1 , 2 } , and p = 1 , then \u2016 L \u2217 ( g ) - c obs \u2016 p provides the number of samples that have been misclassified. Nevertheless, in this paper the theoretical analysis is performed for any arbitrary norm, in order to understand the impact of noise in phenotype prediction. 2. The generalization, that consists in predicting the class of a new sample ( g new ) whose class is unknown using the genetic signatures that have been found during the learning process. One of the main numerical difficulties in learning is the high dimensionality of the genomic data since the number of monitored probes (or genes) is much greater than the number of samples (or patients). This fact provokes that the phenotype prediction in the learning stage will have a very high underdetermined character. Therefore, several gene lists with similar predictive accuracy might exist. This fact can be easily understood considering the classification as a parameter identification or inverse problem [3]: the topography of the cost function O ( g ) in the region of lower misfits (or higher predictive accuracies) corresponds to flat elongated valleys with null gradients where the high predictive genetic signatures are located. Obviously, the topography changes if the space where the optimization is performed ( R s ) changes. All these high predictive lists are expected to be involved in the genetic pathways that explain the phenotype. The smallest-scale signature is the one that has the least number of discriminatory genes. In practice, the predictive accuracy of a genetic signature, O ( g ) , is performed via cross-validation. This knowledge could be very important for early diagnosis and treatment optimization. Also, the sets of high predictive signatures in any phenotype prediction problem can be used to construct biomedical robots that exploit the uncertainty space of the phenotype prediction, to improve the predictive accuracy of the classifier with its corresponding risk assessment, helping to get a better understanding the biological pathways [4]. The presence of noise in the genomic data will impact the classification and obviously the pathway analysis resulting from this procedure. There are at least two main sources of noise in phenotype prediction problems: \u2022 Noise in the gene expression induced by the process of measurement. In this case, the observed genetic expression of a sample j, g j obs , can be expressed as the sum of the true genetic expression array, g j true , and the measurement noise, \u03b4 g j : g j obs = g j true + \u03b4 g j . Therefore, using a simple Taylor expansion we get: (3) L \u2217 ( g j obs ) = L \u2217 ( g j true ) + \u03b4 L \u2217 ( \u03b4 g j ) = L \u2217 ( g j true ) + \u2211 k = 1 s \u2202 L \u2217 \u2202 g k ( g j true ) \u03b4 g jk + o ( \u03b4 g j ) , where o ( \u03b4 g j ) vanishes when the noise term \u03b4 g j \u2192 0 . Obviously, this analysis is theoretical because g j true and \u03b4 g j are unknown. \u2022 Noise in the class assignment since some samples could be wrongly annotated or might belong to a different class, not yet discovered. Naming c true the true class assignment array and \u03b4 c the noise in the class assignment, then the observed class array will be c obs = c true + \u03b4 c . In presence of these types of noise, the genetic signature with the highest predictive score will never perfectly coincide with the genetic signature that explains the disease. Both types of noises ( \u03b4 g , \u03b4 c ) induce a modeling error, ( \u03b4 L \u2217 ( g ) ), in the classifier related to the phenotype prediction. In the case of class assignment noise the cost function writes: (4) O p ( g ) = \u2016 L \u2217 ( g ) - c obs \u2016 p = \u2016 L \u2217 ( g ) - c true - \u03b4 c \u2016 p = \u2016 L \u2217 ( g ) \u2016 p + \u03b4 L \u2217 ( g ) = O t ( g ) + \u03b4 L \u2217 ( g ) , where O p ( g ) , O t ( g ) stand respectively for the perturbed and noise-free cost functions, and \u03b4 L \u2217 ( g ) for the modeling error term induced by the noise in the class assignment. For instance, if the squared Euclidean norm is used to define the cost function, we have: (5) O p ( g ) = \u2016 L \u2217 ( g ) - c obs \u2016 2 2 = \u2016 L \u2217 ( g ) - c true - \u03b4 c \u2016 2 2 = ( L \u2217 ( g ) - c true - \u03b4 c ) T ( L \u2217 ( g ) - c true - \u03b4 c ) = \u2016 L \u2217 ( g ) - c true \u2016 2 2 - 2 ( L \u2217 ( g ) - c true ) T \u03b4 c + \u03b4 c T \u03b4 c . Therefore the modeling error is: (6) \u03b4 L \u2217 ( g ) = \u03b4 c T \u03b4 c - 2 ( L \u2217 ( g ) - c true ) T \u03b4 c , and \u03b4 L \u2217 ( g ) \u2192 0 when \u03b4 c \u2192 0 . What\u2019s more, the classifier, which is constructed ad-hoc and is a priori unknown, induces modeling errors into the classification. Therefore, the automatic conclusion is that O p ( g ) and O t ( g ) will never achieve their corresponding minima for the same genetic signatures ( g ). For that reason, it is also desirable to inspect the genetic signatures having a lower predictive accuracy than the optimum. To alleviate the high underdetermined character of genomic-phenotype prediction problems, feature selection methods are used to reduce the dimensionality of the genomic data. The problem of determining the genes that separate two (or more) classes corresponding to given phenotypes has been traditionally been addressed by filter, wrapper and embedded methods [5]. In the case of filter methods, the gene selection and the classifier for phenotype prediction are independent (uncoupled). Wrapper and embedded techniques are most sophisticated approaches where the gene selection is the solution of an optimization problem; therefore selection and classification are coupled. Wrapper and embedded methods usually involve the use of neural network, support vector machines, decision trees and global optimization algorithms. Filter methods rank different genes according to different measures of their discriminatory power in phenotype prediction problems. 2.2 Gene selection ranking methods and noise To determine the stability and robustness of supervised ranking algorithms in mitigating microarray-generated noise, we compared the Fisher\u2019s ratio (FR), Fold Change (FC), Percentile Distance (PD), Entropy (EN) and SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarrays) using a synthetic dataset and publically available datasets associated with B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Inclusion Body Myositis, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A review of the main feature selection methods in microarray analysis can be consulted in [6]. At a translational level, the aim of this analysis is to establish an optimum way to find the most discriminatory genes in a phenotype prediction and the biological pathways that are involved, and how they are affected by the different sources of noise. Fisher\u2019s ratio uses class information from the samples to find the set of genes that separate the centers of the distribution of both classes, keeping the dispersion in each class quite low (homogenous), that is, the FR method looks for very stable biomarkers along classes. The FR of a gene j in two-class problem, c 1 , c 2 , is defined as follows [7]: (7) FR j ( c 1 , c 2 ) = ( \u03bc j 1 - \u03bc j 2 ) 2 \u03c3 j 1 2 + \u03c3 j 2 2 , where \u03bc j 1 , \u03bc j 2 , are measures of the center of the distribution (means or medians) of the gene j in classes 1 and 2, and \u03c3 j 1 2 , \u03c3 j 2 2 are measures of the dispersion (variance) within these classes. As a result, high FR values correspond to high discriminatory genes of the phenotype and are expected to be involved in the genesis of the illness that is analyzed. Using the medians instead of means makes the FR definition more robust against noise. Noisy genes are penalized in gene selection by FR since uncorrelated white noise in the expression increases the standard deviation, as shown: (8) E j p = E j t + n j , where E j p is the expression of gene j affected by the noise n j which is independent of the true gene expression E j t . Then: (9) \u03bc j p = \u03bc j t + \u03bc n j , \u03c3 j p = \u03c3 j true + \u03c3 n j . The presence of uncorrelated white noise increases the variance of the expression, decreasing the FR of the noisiest genes. The genes are therefore penalized in the selection by FR. The Fold Change of a gene j is defined as follows: (10) fc j ( c 1 , c 2 ) = log 2 \u03bc j 1 \u03bc j 2 . This method selects differentially expressed genes according to their absolute FC value | fc j ( c 1 , c 2 ) | . FC analysis is sensible to noise that obviously affects the mean of the expression in different ways, generating numerical artifacts of under-expression and over-expression. Furthermore, the fact that genes are differentially expresses does not imply that their discriminatory power is high, since the tails of both distributions might still overlap introducing ambiguity in the discrimination. Due to this fact, the volcano plot [1,8,9] has been introduced, combining a statistical test (p-value) with FC and enabling for quick visual identification ofstatistically significant and large-magnitude changes. Nevertheless, the additional p-value discrimination does not solve the problem of distribution tails overlapping. Percentile Distance [10] selects genes with higher distance between the corresponding cumulative probability functions (percentile array) within each class. The percentile distance for attribute j is defined as follows: (11) d j ( c 1 , c 2 ) = \u2016 p j 1 - p j 2 \u2016 2 max ( \u2016 p j 1 \u2016 2 , \u2016 p j 2 \u2016 2 ) ; j = 1 , \u2026 , N att , where p j 1 , p j 2 stand for the percentile vector of the gene j in classes 1 and 2. Percentiles vary from 5 to 95 (or 10\u201390) to avoid the possible effect of outliers. Variables with higher percentile distances between the corresponding discrete cumulative probability functions (percentile array) in each class will be selected. The percentile array takes into account both, the distance between the centers of the distributions (medians or percentile 50%), the interquartile range (percentiles 25% and 75%), and also the distance between the tails of the distributions (percentiles 5\u201310% and 90\u201395%). The Entropy selection method takes into account the ordering mismatch in the expression of a gene with respect to the class vector for a given phenotype [11,12]. Therefore, lower entropies imply in principle bigger discriminatory power. Entropy is affected by noise to the extent that this affects the ordering of the expression signature with respect to the one provided by the phenotype class. Finally, Significance Microarray Analysis (SAM) [1] uses as score the absolute difference between the means in both classes divided by the sum of the total standard deviation ( \u03c3 j T ) and a tunable exchangeability factor ( \u03c3 j 0 ) used to damp the effect of outliers, that is, genes with very small \u03c3 j T that will bring an anomalous score: (12) SAM j ( c 1 , c 2 ) = | \u03bc j 1 - \u03bc j 2 | \u03c3 j T + \u03c3 j 0 . A variety of analyses have been performed to study the sensitivity of some of these methods to noise in the expression data [13\u201316]. However, so far the robustness against different kind of noises for all these ranking methods has not been addressed. For that purpose, we used a synthetic dataset where three different types of noise were introduced: additive Gaussian noise, lognormal noise and noise in the class assignment. The Gaussian noise has been introduced through a random number generator following a normal distribution n j \u2192 N ( 0 , r n E j t ) for each gene, being r n the noise level, and E j t is the noise-free expression of the gene j. Therefore, the noisy expression corresponding to the gene j would be: (13) E j p = E j t + n j . In this model of noise all the probes are perturbed the same percentage r n of their expression. This fact obviously implies that the noise perturbation is higher for the probes with higher expression. The lognormal noise has been obtained by adding Gaussian noise to the logarithms of the expression: (14) ln j = log 2 s j \u2192 N ( 0 , r n log 2 E j t ) . Therefore, the lognormal noise has a scaling effect (multiplicative noise), since: (15) log 2 E j p = log 2 E j t + ln j , E j p = s j E j t . In the case of class assignment noise, a given number of samples are misclassified. The class assignment and lognormal noises belong to the category of non-Gaussian noise. The synthetic dataset was built with a predefined number of differentially expressed genes. We subsequently introduced different levels of noise: 1\u20136% for Gaussian and log-Gaussian noises and 10\u201340% for the class assignment noise. To check the performance of the different ranking methods we used the Precision metric: (16) Precision = | { DE _ genes } \u2229 { Selected _ genes } | | { Selected _ genes } | , where { DE _ genes } is the set of the differentially expressed genes and { Selected _ genes } the set of genes selected by the ranking algorithm. Some preliminary analysis concerning the effect of label noise in classification problems and in gene expression can be found in [17,18]. 2.3 The synthetic and disease datasets A flow diagram for the methodology used in this paper is shown in Fig. 1 . The synthetic datasets was created to compare the various filtering methods against a known dataset and then, based on these findings, create a hierarchy which defines the effectiveness of the ranking methods against different kind of noise and to understand how to find optimally the biological pathways in disease datasets. The synthetic dataset was built simulating a real dataset related to Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (163 samples and 48,807 probes) [19] using the OC-plus package available for The Comprehensive R Archive Network [20]. This package includes a function (MAsim.real) that allows simulating microarray data with fixed effect sizes from real data sets. For each group, the specified number of samples is sampled either with replacement from the columns of the real data; for each gene, the group means are subtracted from the resampled data, so that the group wise and overall mean for each gene is zero. For that purpose two parameters should be specified: 1. The proportion of genes that will be differentially expressed, P0 . 2. The effect D (evenly split between up- and down-regulation) for the differential expression, expressed in units of the gene-specific standard deviation. This parameter serves to establish the difference in expression among the set of differentially expressed genes and the rest. The original data was compound of 163 samples and 48,807 probes. We have chosen this dataset for building the synthetic dataset because it has a good sample size and the class is well balanced. The experiment was set up as follows: 1. The class of the synthetic dataset was the same as the one observed for the IgVH status [19]: 92 vs 71. 2. The noise-free synthetic data set (expression) was generated using as main parameters D = 2 and P 0 = 0.47 . This simulation has generated 229 genes to be differentially expressed, which we will try to recover via the different gene-ranking methods. These genes are supposed in the synthetic dataset to optimally differentiate the known IgVH status. Furthermore, we have modeled different real microarray datasets to confirm these findings: 1. B-cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) dataset composed by 163 samples and 48,807 probes [19] (the dataset can be downloaded from the European Genome Archive: EGAS00001000374). CLL is a complex and molecular heterogeneous disease which is the most common adult Leukemia in western countries. DNA analyses served to distinguish two major types of CLL with different survival times based on the maturity of the lymphocytes, as discerned by the Immunoglobulin Heavy chain Variable-region (IgVH) gene mutation status. 92 samples had the IgVH gene mutated versus 71 samples with worse prognosis. The aim of this analysis is to find the pathways that are associated with bad prognosis in CLL patients. 2. Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM): microarray studies (with 22,283 probes) were performed on muscle biopsy specimens from 23 patients with inclusion body myositis and 11 samples without neuromuscular disease [21] (the dataset can be downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus: GSE3112). IBM is a muscle disease characterized by chronic, progressive muscle inflammation accompanied by muscle weakness. The aim of this analysis is to find the pathways that are associated to the development of IBM with respect to healthy controls. 3. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) dataset composed by 85 samples (57 samples are ALS cases and 28 healthy controls) and 54,675 probes [22] (the dataset can be downloaded from the European Bioinformatics Institute: E-TABM-940). ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of motor neurons. These authors have shown that the co-stimulatory pathway is upregulated in the blood of a high percentage of human patients with ALS (56%). The aim of this analysis is to define the genes that are associated with a diagnosis of ALS, the possible causes and the biological pathways that are involved. These datasets are representative of 3 different types of diseases: cancer, rare and neurodegenerative diseases. Besides, they have a reasonable sample size and a good balance between both classes in each case. Although all the microarray datasets treated herein are post processed via the RMA algorithm that performs an estimation and correction of the noise [23], noise is still present due to the complexity of the data acquisition. Because the genes which are differentially expressed in real datasets are unknown, we have applied the methodology explained in [24] to select the smallest subset of high discriminatory probes. In summary, the method consists in ranking the genes according to their discriminatory power, selecting different lists of genes through Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and establishing their predictive accuracy via Leave-One-Out-Cross-Validation (LOOCV). Additionally, we included for each disease dataset the pathways analysis and the correlation networks to understand how the expression of the most discriminatory genes is controlled in each case. The pathways analysis was performed using Gene-Analytics tool provided by the Weizmann Institute of Science [25]. For the correlation networks we used the approach presented in [26], using the Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the dependency between genes. Once the Pearson coefficient is calculated, Kruskal\u2019s algorithm [27] is used to find the minimum-spanning-tree between the selected genes and building the correlation network using as head the gene with the most discriminatory power. Recently, we have numerically shown [4] that phenotype classification problems approach a linearly separable behavior when the most discriminatory features (or genes) are found. Therefore the correlation networks make perfect sense to study the existing trade-offs between the main discriminatory genes in phenotype prediction problems. This set of genes contributes to the different pathways that are related to the phenotype. These datasets have also been modeled through biomedical robots [4] that exploit the uncertainty space of the classifiers in phenotype prediction problems via consensus strategies. Therefore, this paper is also useful for analyzing the sensitivity towards noise of the main ranking methods used in the design of these biomedical robots. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthetic data In order to compare the performance of each method we calculated the precision for each method, considering the set of 229 genes that were differentially expressed in the synthetic dataset. The precision was calculated using the first 229 genes selected by each method, exactly the same number of genes that are differentially expressed. Table 1 provides the precision for all the ranking methods mentioned above for different noise types and levels. Table 2 shows the LOOCV mean accuracy and the number of selected genes in each method. Besides, we have also calculated the Precision-Recall curves for each feature selection method and level of noise. The curves were constructed varying the number of selected probes given by each ranking method. The cutoff varies from 1 (1% of the first ranked probes for each method were selected) to 100% (all the probes were selected) with an increasing step of 0.01%. Figs. 2\u20134 show these curves for every type of noise and noise level. It can be observed the following: 1. As we expected, the precision decreases for all the methods as the noise level increases (refer to Table 1). The FR provides the best precision score for all the noise types and levels. These differences decrease very fast with the noise level in the case of lognormal noise. The precision figures for SAM, in some cases, are very close to FR. In the case of class assignment noise FR keeps precision levels up to 90% for 10\u201325% of noise, showing a very good robustness against this type of noise (Table 1). This result has an important translational impact in real datasets to find the biological pathways that are involved in the disease development. 2. The differences in the LOOCV mean accuracy (Table 2) is not so clear and all methods provide similar results for the three types of noise at the different levels in the expenses of increasing the number or probes needed to improve the LOOCV predictive accuracy. In the case of Gaussian noise, SAM and FR show very similar results obtaining 100% of predictive accuracy with a much more reduced set of selected probes. Regarding lognormal noise, entropy seems to be the best for lower level of noises, while SAM and FR behave better when the noise level increases. FR and SAM are the best methods with a very little difference between them in the case of class assignment noise. These conclusions can also be clearly observed in the Precision-Recall curves (Figs. 2\u20134). We have also combined the Gaussian noise and the Log-Gaussian noise with the noise in the class assignment obtaining similar results. Adding the class assignment noise to a noisy dataset (for both Gaussian and Log-Gaussian noises) affects much more in finding the differentially expressed genes since the Precision decreases drastically (see Supplementary material Table 1). What is interesting is that the fold change seems to work better in terms of precision for a combination of class assignment and log-Gaussian noise. In terms of predictive accuracy more genes are needed to have a high predictive accuracy when class assignment noise is present (see Supplementary material, Table 2). In this case, FR and SAM provide the best results. Furthermore, it is possible to observe that for high levels of noise we can achieve high predictive accuracy with null precision at the expenses of adding a lot of genes to the predictive genetic signature. In this case, the biological pathways are clearly falsified. In conclusion, noise in class assignment affects the selection of the important discriminatory genes in phenotype prediction problems more than noise in the expression data. This result emphasizes the importance in translational medicine of having at disposal a correct class assignment of the samples, provided by the doctors. 3.2 Disease datasets Concerning the real datasets we selected the smallest subset of high discriminatory probes using the methodology described in [24]. Table 3 shows the mean accuracy and number of selected probes for each ranking method and dataset. For these three datasets we achieved accuracies higher than 90% with a very small subset of probes. The selection was performed via recursive feature elimination and a nearest-neighbor based algorithm through the LOOCV accuracy [24]. In the case of CLL, the difference between all the methods is very small. The entropy method achieved 94% of accuracy with 99 probes. However SAM got almost 94% of accuracy with 26 probes and FR 93% with only 6 probes. High discriminatory genes of the IgVH phenotype include: LPL, CRY1, LOC100128252, SPG20, ZBTB20, NRIP1, ZAP-70, LDOC1, COBLL1 and NRIP1. Similar sets of high predictive genes have been described by other teams [28\u201330]. The pathway analysis has revealed the importance of the Inflammatory Response, the PAK pathway and the ERK signaling super pathway that includes ERK signaling, ILK signaling, MAPK signaling, Molecular Mechanisms of cancer and Rho Family GTPases pathway. These pathways control Proliferation, Differentiation, Survival and Apoptosis. Also, other important pathways found were Allograft Rejection, the Inflammatory Response Pathway, CD28 Co-stimulation, TNF-alpha/NF-kB Signaling Pathway, Akt Signaling, PAK Pathway and TNF Signaling. The presence of some of these pathways opens the hypothesis of viral infection as a cause of CLL. Fig. 5 shows the correlation tree between the most discriminatory genes found by FR that provided the highest precision in synthetic modeling. Note that the most important branch is associated to the connection LPL/ZBTB 20. Regarding the IBM dataset, we found that SAM and FR were able to correctly predict 97% of the samples just with 2 and 1 probes respectively. Differences between SAM and FR and other methods are remarkable. Nevertheless, we are interested in the list of most discriminatory genes of the IBM phenotype that include: HLA-C, HLA-B, TMSB10, S100A6, HLA-G, STAT1, TIMP1, HLA-F, IRF9, BID, MLLT11 and PSME2. Note the presence of different HLA-x genes of major histocompatibility. Particularly, the function of the gene HLA-B would explain alone the genesis of IBM: \u201cHLA-B (major histocompatibility complex, class I, B) is a human gene that provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in the immune system. HLA-B is part of a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system to distinguish the body\u2019s own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria\u201d. The analysis of biological pathways has revealed the importance of viral infections, mainly in IBM patients: Allograft Rejection, Influenza A, Class I MHC Mediated Antigen Processing and Presentation, Staphylococcus Aureus Infection, Interferon Signaling, Immune Response IFN Alpha/beta Signaling Pathway, Phagosome, Tuberculosis, Cell Adhesion Molecules (CAMs), Epstein-Barr Virus Infection, and TNF Signaling. We can see several viral and bacterial infections in this list. It is interesting to remark that 75% of the cases of infectious myositis are due to Staphylococcus Aureus [31]. Fig. 6 shows the correlation tree for the IBM phenotype, indicating the importance of the major histocompatibility gene family. Similar results were found by Greenberg et al. [32] by studying the molecular profiles of inflammatory myopathies. Finally, in the case of ALS dataset, SAM reached an accuracy of 95% with 42 probes, whilst FR and PD got a 94% with 12 and 17 probes respectively. High discriminatory genes of the ALS phenotype include: CASP1, ZNF787 and SETD7. The pathway analysis has revealed the importance of the GPCR Pathway, RhoA Signaling Pathway, EPHB Forward Signaling, EphrinA-EphR Signaling, EBV LMP1 Signaling, and Regulation of Microtubule Cytoskeleton. These pathways have different important signaling roles and suggest a possible link to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Finally Fig. 7 shows the correlation tree between the most discriminatory genes found by FR, highlighting the link between caspases, zinc finger proteins and the gene NKAP that encodes a protein that is involved in the activation of the ubiquitous transcription factor NF-kappaB. The activation of caspases plays a central role in cell apoptosis and activates interleukin-1, a cytokine involved in the processes such as inflammation. In the case of ALS the mutation of SOD1 (copper zinc superoxide dismutase 1) has been described as the cause for the sequential activation of caspase-1 that acts slowly as a chronic initiator and caspase-3 acting as the final effect for of cell death [33]. This role has been proved in transgenic animal models [34]. Caspases have been also associated to the pathogenesis of Huntington Disease (HD) [35]. These authors also described the caspase inhibition as a possible therapeutic strategy that merits evaluation in humans with HD. 4 Conclusion We have theoretically showed that noise in expression data and class assignment partially falsifies the sets of discriminatory probes in phenotype prediction problems. Via synthetic modeling we have shown that FR and SAM are the most robust gene selection methods for different kind of noises. Besides, FR and SAM seem to exploit the parsimony principle and are able to find the smallest-scale high discriminatory gene signature. Nevertheless, SAM is much more computationally expensive than FR while the achieved results are similar. We have also found that noise in class assignment affect the predictive accuracy and the precision much more than noise in the expression data. Nevertheless, the No-Free-Lunch Theorem in search and optimization [36] states that all these algorithms are needed to understand the complex relationships hidden in the genomic datasets. Therefore, the prior knowledge provided by the doctors is of paramount importance in the search for solutions of the different diseases. From the translational point of view this analysis shows the importance of establishing the discriminatory power of the genes in phenotype prediction problems to correctly find the biological pathways that are involved. To accomplish this task in the most efficient way possible, suggested in this paper, we suggest ranking the most differentially expressed genes according to their Fisher\u2019 ratio (or SAM ratio). Examples to cancer (CLL), rare (IBM) and neurodegenerative diseases (ALS) are also outlined in this paper obtaining very interesting conclusions that might imply an important role of several viral infections.

Not only does such noise impact the scientific validity and costs of studies, but when assessed in the context of clinically translatable indications such as phenotype prediction, it can lead to inaccurate conclusions that could ultimately impact patients. We applied a sequence of ranking methods to damp noise associated with microarray outputs, and then tested the utility of the approach in three disease indications using publically available datasets. Materials and methods This study was performed in three phases. We first theoretically analyzed the effect of noise in phenotype prediction problems showing that it can be expressed as a modeling error that partially falsifies the pathways. Secondly, via synthetic modeling, we performed the sensitivity analysis for the main gene ranking methods to different types of noise. Finally, we studied the predictive accuracy of the gene lists provided by these ranking methods in synthetic data and in three different datasets related to cancer, rare and neurodegenerative diseases to better understand the translational aspects of our findings. Results and discussion In the case of synthetic modeling, we showed that Fisher\u2019s Ratio (FR) was the most robust gene ranking method in terms of precision for all the types of noise at different levels. Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) provided slightly lower performance and the rest of the methods (fold change, entropy and maximum percentile distance) were much less precise and accurate. The predictive accuracy of the smallest set of high discriminatory probes was similar for all the methods in the case of Gaussian and Log-Gaussian noise. In the case of class assignment noise, the predictive accuracy of SAM and FR is higher. Finally, for real datasets (Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Inclusion Body Myositis and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) we found that FR and SAM provided the highest predictive accuracies with the smallest number of genes. Biological pathways were found with an expanded list of genes whose discriminatory power has been established via FR. Conclusions We have shown that noise in expression data and class assignment partially falsifies the sets of discriminatory probes in phenotype prediction problems. FR and SAM better exploit the principle of parsimony and are able to find subsets with less number of high discriminatory genes. The predictive accuracy and the precision are two different metrics to select the important genes, since in the presence of noise the most predictive genes do not completely coincide with those that are related to the phenotype. Based on the synthetic results, FR and SAM are recommended to unravel the biological pathways that are involved in the disease development.", "openArchiveArticle": "true", "prism:coverDate": "2016-12-31", "openaccessUserLicense": "http://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/", "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1532046416301496", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "deAndr\u00e9s-Galiana, Enrique J."}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Mart\u00ednez, Juan L."}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Sonis, Stephen T."}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1532046416301496"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046416301496"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": "Full", "pii": "S1532-0464(16)30149-6", "prism:volume": "64", "prism:publisher": "Elsevier Inc.", "dc:title": "Sensitivity analysis of gene ranking methods in phenotype prediction", "prism:copyright": "\u00a9 2016 Elsevier Inc.
