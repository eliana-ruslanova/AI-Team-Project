Abstract This paper explores the role of named entities (NEs) in the classification of disease outbreak report. In the annotation schema of BioCaster, a text mining system for public health protection, important concepts that reflect information about infectious diseases were conceptually analyzed with a formal ontological methodology and classified into types and roles. Types are specified as NE classes and roles are integrated into NEs as attributes such as a chemical and whether it is being used as a therapy for some infectious disease. We focus on the roles of NEs and explore different ways to extract, combine and use them as features in a text classifier. In addition, we investigate the combination of roles with semantic categories of disease-related nouns and verbs. Experimental results using na\u00efve Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms show that: (1) roles in combination with NEs improve performance in text classification, (2) roles in combination with semantic categories of noun and verb features contribute substantially to the improvement of text classification. Both these results were statistically significant compared to the baseline \u201craw text\u201d representation. We discuss in detail the effects of roles on each NE and on semantic categories of noun and verb features in terms of accuracy, precision/recall and F-score measures for the text classification task. Keywords Text classification Semantic roles Named entities Information extraction 1 Introduction Today, the Internet is a powerful tool for discovering novel information via news feed providers. This is becoming increasingly important for the public health domain because it can help to detect emerging and re-emerging diseases. In infectious disease surveillance systems such as the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) system [23] and ProMed-Mail [13], the detection and tracking of outbreaks using the Internet has been proven to be a key source of information for public health workers, clinicians, and researchers interested in communicable diseases. The basis for such systems is the monitoring of a large number of news articles simultaneously. The classification of news articles into disease-related or none disease-related classes is the first stage in any automated approach to this task. In practice, however, there are many articles related to diseases which are not directly concerned with an infectious disease outbreak. Therefore, we need a classifier that can distinguish between general disease oriented news (for example, developments in cancer or diabetes research, vaccination campaigns) and infectious disease outbreak report (for example, reports about new cases of cholera, ebola and so on.) Classification criteria broadly include news related to newly emerging diseases, the spread of diseases across international borders, the deliberate release of a human or engineered pathogen, etc. The use of only raw text in the classification process inevitably fails to resolve many subtle ambiguities, for example semantic class ambiguities in polysemous words like \u201cvirus\u201d, \u201cfever\u201d, \u201coutbreak\u201d, and \u201ccontrol\u201d which all exhibit a variety of senses depending on context. These different senses appear with relatively high frequency in the news especially in headlines where language is often used in a highly creative way. A further challenge is that disease names can be denoted by many variant forms or may not be mentioned at all in the early stages of an outbreak when diagnosis has not been made. Therefore we consider that the use of advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques like named entity recognition (NER) and anaphora resolution are needed in order to achieve high classification accuracy. Fig. 1 shows a simplified flowchart of the BioCaster surveillance system [6]. The system uses advanced text mining technology to detect and track outbreak diseases from Internet news. In the initial stages, important terms that relate to the public health domain in news stories are identified by an NE recognition step, this is followed by role labeling which assigns a semantic role to NEs (discussed in the next section). These stages add richer information into news stories such as disease, symptom, virus, condition and treatments. Topic classification is then conducted to filter news stories into relevant or reject classes. Once classified, relevant news stories are sent to a semantic analysis module which will assign them into different levels of importance, i.e., alert, publish or reject. News stories that are considered as \u201calert\u201d will be reported immediately to public health workers who have registered an interest in this topic. Text classification is defined as the task of assigning documents into one or more predefined categories. As shown by [5], an accurate text classification system can be especially valuable to database curators in the life sciences. A document in the biomedical domain can be annotated using NER techniques with enriched semantic information in the form of NEs such as the disease, pathogen, location, and time. NER and term identification in general have been recognized as an important research topic both in the NLP and biomedical communities [18]. However, an investigation into the contribution of NEs on the performance of biomedical text classification has remained an open question until now. There are two main reasons for this: firstly there are only a small number of open annotation schema, and secondly there is no benchmark data for testing. So far there are only a few published schema in the biomedical domain [32]. Among the best known is the GENIA project 1 http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/GENIA 1 which contains genes, their products and biological locations as well as linguistic information like part-of-speech, syntactic and semantic information [17]. In the clinical domain, Chapman and Dowling [4] proposed an annotation schema for manually indexing clinical conditions from emergency department reports which it takes into account syntactic and semantic variables. Recently, Roberts et al. [26] developed an annotation framework called CLEF (Clinical E-Science Framework) which derived from operational electronic patient records to enable ethical and user-friendly access to patient information. For annotation schema in newswire articles, Wiebe and colleagues [31,33] annotated text segments for expressions of opinion and emotion. However, remarkably little work has been done on developing an annotation schema that integrates markable concepts related to public health such as diseases, symptoms, geographic locations, temporal expressions and chemicals. BioCaster therefore provides an annotation schema that can fill this gap. Our schema, which is based on discussions with biologists, computational linguists and public health experts, helps identify entities related to infectious diseases which are then used to build up a detailed picture of the outbreak events in later stages of text mining. One significant aspect of the schema is that it is based on formal concept analysis with a formal ontological methodology. The notion of role is central within ontological modeling, encapsulating how entities are involved in processes and situations (contexts). For example protein is a type whereas enzyme is a role, a chemical is a type whereas etiology is a role, a human is a type whereas doctor is a role, milk is a type whereas food is a role. From these examples we can see intuitively that role is essentially a context dependent notion. As noted in [3], the distinction is an important one not least because (a) roles are dependent on types but not vice versa, (b) roles cannot subsume types, (c) type level relations are expected to be mutually disjoint whereas role relations are not. In practice actually deciding what constitutes a role or a type can sometimes be confusing (e.g., doctors as a group or doctor as a role) [29] and recent work by Guarino and Welty [10,11] has provided a series of rule of thumb heuristics based on logically founded meta-properties for clarifying this distinction in candidate concepts. In our previous study [16] we applied Guarino and Welty\u2019s formal concept analysis to derive a set of well founded \u201cmarkable\u201d type entities and their roles within epidemiological processes. The work in this study takes our previous investigation several steps forward by showing empirical evidence for the contribution roles can make in a practical classification application, and compares the contribution made by different roles. In this paper, we focus on the task of text classification, proceeding under the simplifying assumption that given enough annotated training data for NEs and their roles both can be automatically tagged with high accuracy. In recent years there have been many studies on text classification in general [28,36], semi-structured texts [19], and XML classification [38]. More specifically, there are some studies investigating the contribution of semantic features, e.g., synonyms, hypernyms extracted from WordNet [2,12,27], or syntactic patterns (like noun and verb phrases) and n-gram [2,8,9]. Other features based on semantic categories of nouns and verbs [22,24] are investigated and used efficiently in classification task, e.g., sentence classification and in information extraction. In [7], we presented a preliminary report on the roles of NEs in annotated text classification using the na\u00efve Bayes algorithm. The current work has extended this by exploring a greater variety of semantic features over a larger corpus and compares na\u00efve Bayes to the SVM algorithm. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we briefly discuss the distinction between types and roles and outline the BioCaster schema for the annotation of terms in biomedical text; Section 3 presents a description of the BioCaster gold standard corpus; Section 4 provides details of the methodology and experimental results of classification on the gold standard corpus is presented in Section 5. Finally, we draw some conclusions in Section 6. 2 BioCaster schema for annotation of terms in biomedical text The BioCaster annotation schema is a component of the BioCaster text mining project. We have identified several important concepts that reflect information about infectious diseases, and created guidelines for annotating them as target entity classes in texts. Based on the conceptual analysis using meta-properties (rigidity, identity, and dependency) developed by Guarino and Welty [10,11], categories of important concepts were classified as types and roles. The 18 categories of types are specified as NE classes which we denote here in upper case. These include PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, TIME, DISEASE, CONDITION (status of patient such as \u201chospitalized\u201d or \u201cin stable condition\u201d), OUTBREAK (event of group infection), VIRUS, ANATOMY (body part), PRODUCT (biological product such as \u201cvaccine\u201d), NONHUMAN (animals), DNA, RNA, PROTEIN, CONTROL (control measures to contain the disease), BACTERIA, CHEMICAL and SYMPTOM. The three roles we explore are case (diseased person), transmission (source of infection) and therapeutic (therapeutic agent). The roles are specified as XML attributes taken by the NE classes. As we discussed earlier one of the major differences between types and roles is that roles are dependent on time or situation where as types are not. For example, someone can be a case of a disease but he/she may not be a disease case at some other time. On the other hand, in the ordinary sense if someone is a person, he cannot cease to be a person at any time as long as he exists. Another characteristic of roles is that they always have some basic types. For example, disease cases include persons, and therapeutic agents include chemical substances. We incorporated this characteristic of roles into the annotation schema, by declaring that case is taken by PERSON, therapeutic is taken by CHEMICAL and PRODUCT, and transmission is taken by NONHUMAN, PRODUCT and ANATOMY. The value of each role is Boolean: true or false. 2 In the BioCaster annotation schema, we added another attribute number (number of people) to PERSON. Number has the value one or many 2 This is summarized in Table 1 . NEs and their roles in the BioCaster annotation schema are integrated in XML format as follows: <NAME cl=\"Named Entity\" attribute1=\"value1\" attribute2= \"value2\"...>... </NAME>, where \u2018\u2018Named Entity\" is one of the names for the 18 BioCaster NEs and attribute1, attribute2,... are the names of the NE\u2019s roles, \u2018\u2018value1\",\u2018\u2018value2\",... are values of roles. Further details of the annotation guidelines are discussed in [16]. Kawazoe et al. showed some advantages of this annotation schema over a more task-oriented one which did not make any distinction between types and roles and consider both as NE classes. One of the advantages is that we can make consistent annotations for multiple mentions to the same person in different states in different time points as follows: <NAME cl=\"PERSON\" case=\"false\"> Hudd </NAME> has writtenseveral books on music hall and variety... Doctor laterdiagnosed <NAME cl=\"PERSON\" case=\"true\"> Hudd </NAME> witha chest infection. In addition, this approach helped to improve NE recognition performance on 200 training articles using on the SVM algorithm. F-score improved from 76.96% to 79.96% for all classes. In particular, Kawazoe et al. observed a large improvement in PERSON F-score from 59.95% to 66.28% and NONHUMAN from 68.0% to 73.21% [16]. 3 BioCaster gold standard data corpus The BioCaster gold standard corpus was collected from Internet news and manually annotated by two doctoral students. The annotation of news article proceeded as follows. Firstly, NEs are annotated following the BioCaster schema and guidelines. Secondly, each annotated article is manually assigned into one of four relevancy categories: alert, publish, check, and reject. The assignment is based on guidelines developed during discussions with epidemiologists, and a survey of World Health Organization (WHO) reports [34]. Where there were major differences of opinion in NE annotation or relevancy assignment between the two annotators, we consulted a public health expert in order to decide the most appropriate assignment. Finally we had a total of 1000 articles that were fully annotated. While this is small compared to other data sets in text classification, we consider that it is large enough to obtain a preliminary indication about the usefulness of roles. These articles were mainly collected from press news reports (Reuters, BBC, Yahoo! News \u2026) and official reports (WHO, ProMed-Mail,\u2026). These also cover many topic domains, information about domain distribution of the BioCaster gold standard corpus is shown in Table 2 . The following is a typical example of an annotated article in the BioCaster gold standard corpus. The entities are shown within NAME elements while the DOC header contains information on language, source, domain, date of publication, etc. Example <DOC id=\"000125\" language=\"en-us\" source=\"WHO\" domain= \"health\" subdomain=\"disease\" date_published=\"2005-03-17\" relevancy=\"alert\"> <NAME cl=\"DISEASE\"> Acute fever </NAME> and <NAME cl=\"DISEASE\"> rash syndrome </NAME> in <NAME cl=\"LOCATION\">Nigeria</NAME> <NAME cl=\"TIME\"> 17 March 2005. </NAME><NAME cl=\"ORGANIZATION\"> WHO</NAME> has received reports of <NAME cl=\"PERSON\" case=\"true\" number=\"many\"> 1118 cases </NAME> including <NAME cl=\"PERSON\" case=\"true\" number=\"many\">76 deaths</NAME>case fatality rate, 6.8% reported in 12 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of <NAME cl= \"LOCATION\">damawa </NAME>state,<NAME cl=\"LOCATION\">Nigeria </NAME> as of <NAME cl=\"TIME\">28 February 2005</NAME>. The cases have been clinically diagnosed as <NAME cl=\"DISEASE\"> measles </NAME> but no laboratory diagnosis has been made to date. Other states, including <NAME cl=\"LOCATION\"> Gombe</NAME>, <NAME cl=\"LOCATION\">Jigawa</NAME>,<NAME cl=\"LOCATION\">Kaduna</NAME>, <NAME cl=\"LOCATION\">Kano </NAME>, and <NAME cl=\"LOCATION\">Kebbi</NAME> have all reported <NAME cl=\"OUTBREAK\"> outbreaks </NAME> of <NAME cl=\"DISEASE\"> measles </NAME>... </DOC>. We grouped the 1000 articles into two categories: reject and relevant. The reject category corresponds simply to articles with label reject while the relevant category includes articles with labels alert, publish, and check. We conflated the alert, publish and check categories because we hypothesized that distinguishing between non-reject (relevant) categories would require higher level semantic knowledge such as pathogen infectivity and previous occurrence history which is the job of the text mining system and the end user. The conflated two-way scheme is shown in Fig. 2 . Finally, we had a total of 650 news articles belong to the reject category and 350 news articles belong to the relevant category. The statistical information about NEs and roles are shown in Table 3 . 4 Methodology In this Section, we describe the methodology for investigating the effect of NE classes and their roles on classification performance for the BioCaster gold standard corpus. Firstly, we briefly describe the algorithms we used: na\u00efve Bayes and SVM. Secondly, we describe feature representations. And finally, performance measures used to evaluate are outlined. 4.1 Classifiers The classifier we use in this paper is the standard na\u00efve Bayes classifier [21] and SVM algorithm [30]. Na\u00efve Bayes is considered as the baseline and SVM is considered as the state-of-the-art algorithm in the text classification task [28]. In the pre-processing we did not use a stop list or apply word stemming. We used term frequency as term weighting and a linear kernel to build the SVM model. The experiments were implemented in Linux OS, using the Bow toolkit [20] for the na\u00efve Bayes classifier and the SVMlight [14]. The methodology is as follows. The data set was randomly divided into 10 folds. Each fold has 35 articles belonging to the relevant category and 65 articles belonging to the reject category. Then, we implemented 10-fold cross-validation: 9 parts for training and the remaining part was used for testing. For the training set we extract NE classes and their roles combining with semantic nouns and verbs as features to build a classifier. Details are described below. 4.2 Feature representations In this section, we describe in detail the various feature representations used in the current work. Note that we use a \u201craw text\u201d representation as our baseline and a role\u2019s value must be \u201ctrue\u201d for it to count as a document feature. 4.2.1 Features for role only In order to investigate the effect of each role, we use the following features as combinations, (1) Case only: feature as raw text and case are used. (2) Transmission only: feature as raw text and transmission are used. (3) Therapeutic only: feature as raw text and therapeutic are used. 4.2.2 Feature for NEs and their roles Features for each NE: each NE is extracted and used with raw text. We denoted NE1 as features extracted from named entity NE1. For example, DISEASE1 means features are raw text together DISEASE, VIRUS1 means features are raw text together with the VIRUS class. Features for NEs with each role: we investigated the effect of NEs with roles, i.e., case, therapeutic, and transmission. Features are chosen as follows: (1) PERSON+case: raw text and PERSON class with case are used as features. (2) NONHUMAN+trans: raw text and NONHUMAN class and transmission are used as features. (3) ANATOMY+trans: raw text and ANATOMY class and transmission are used as features. (4) PRODUCT+trans+thera: raw text and PRODUCT class and both transmission and therapeutic are used as features. (5) PRODUCT+trans: raw text and PRODUCT class and transmission are used as features. (6) PRODUCT+thera: raw text and PRODUCT class and therapeutic are used as features. (7) CHEMICAL+thera: raw text and CHEMICAL class and therapeutic are used as features. Features for NEs with roles: we investigate both features for disease-related NEs which include DISEASE, VIRUS, BACTERIA, SYMPTOM, CONDITION, CONTROL, DNA, PROTEIN, RNA, OUTBREAK, PRODUCT, ANATOMY, NONHUMAN, CHEMICAL and features for all NEs with their roles as follows: (1) Text+DiseaseNEs: raw text and all disease-related NEs are used as features. (2) Text+DiseaseNEs+roles: raw text and all NEs disease-related classes with roles are used as features. (3) Text+AllNEs: raw text and all NEs are used as features. (4) Text+AllNEs+roles: raw text and all NEs with roles are used as features. 4.2.3 Word group features for semantic categorization Following recent work by Phillips and Riloff [24] we were motivated to exploit domain-dependent role identifying expressions for their contribution to topic classification. The approach we took was to develop a set of WordNet style synonym sets based on a manual examination of existing resources such as WordNet and an examination of ProMed-Mail disease outbreak reports for evidence of occurrence patterns within the domain. For example, \u201cdoctor\u201d, \u201cnurse\u201d, \u201cphysician\u201d and \u201csurgeon\u201d all belong to a semantic category which we could paraphrase as medical_occupation. Similarly verbs such as \u201cdetect\u201d, \u201cfind\u201d, \u201cdiscover\u201d and \u201cconfirm\u201d could all belong to a grouping called detect_verbs, The resulting list held 25 and 49 semantic categories of nouns and verbs, respectively.\u201d The following are some examples of our semantic categories for nouns in which the first term corresponds to semantic category and the terms in bracket are members of that semantic category. victim (death, fatality, case, victim, patient) medical_occupation (doctor, nurse, physician, surgeon, hospital worker, health worker, psychiatric worker, medic) medical_facility (hospital, clinic, ward, center, centre) spokesman (official, doctor, authority, officer, chief, spokesman). The following are some examples of semantic categories of verb features. spread_verbs (spread, circulate, progress, carry) report_verbs (report, confirm) examine_verbs (examine, check, screen) detect_verbs (detect, find, discover, confirm, diagnose) infect_verbs (infect, affect) transmit_verbs (pass, transmit, convey, carry) hospitalize_verbs_past (hospitalize, admit). The features of semantic categories of nouns and verbs were selected as follows: We simply scan the input text, if there is a term which was determined to be a noun or a verb in the lists then the semantic category of that term is added as a feature; the process continues until the end of text. The semantic category of nouns and verbs in combination with roles of NEs are used in text classification, including (1) AllNEs+roles+N: all NEs, raw text, roles and semantic category of nouns are used as features. (2) AllNEs+roles+N: all NEs, raw text, roles and semantic category of verbs are used as features. (3) AllNEs+roles+N&V: all NEs, raw text, roles and both semantic category of nouns and verbs are used as features. An illustrative example of using different features is shown in Table 4 . 4.2.4 Performance measures We use conventional performance measures: precision/recall, accuracy, and F-score in this work. They are calculated based on a two-way contingency table (Table 5 ) [35]. In this table, \u201cAssigned YES/NO\u201d means documents were classified into the relevant/reject class by a classifier, \u201cYES/NO is correct\u201d means documents was classified into the relevant/reject class by human judgment. The table has four cells: a counts the assigned and correct cases, b counts the assigned and incorrect cases, c counts the not assigned but incorrect cases, and d counts the not assigned and correct cases [35]. Performance measures are defined as follows: (1) precision = a a + b , and recall = a a + c . Accuracy is defined as accuracy = ( a + d ) / ( a + b + c + d ) , and F-score measure is a measure of combining precision/recall and is defined by (2) F - score = 2 \u00d7 precision \u00d7 recall precision + recall . Additionally, in order to determine the difference between two methods, we used a statistical significant test [1]. Where statistical significance levels are reported, 10-fold cross-validation in conjunction with a t-test (p<0.05). 5 Results and discussions 5.1 Effectiveness of NEs with roles The results of combined NEs with roles are shown in Table 6 . It is easy to see that: firstly, combined NEs (with roles and without roles) outperformed the baseline and secondly, combined NEs with roles substantially improve performance in terms of accuracy and F-score compared to ones without roles. The t-test showed that the differences between baseline and the remaining text representations, e.g., baseline vs. DiseaseNEs, baseline vs. AllNEs, baseline vs. AllNEs+roles in both algorithms are significant. From Table 6 we can see that the combination of AllNEs, i.e., all NEs achieved F-score better than those of disease-related NEs, i.e., DiseaseNEs. It shows that all NEs contribute to the improvement of the performance. The main results from Table 6 can be illustrated in Fig. 3 . We can see clearly that using semantically rich features leads to an increase in F-score. The best F-score achieved uses a combination of all NEs, roles and semantic categories of nouns and verbs, i.e., AllNEs+roles+N&V. We proceeded to see the effect of roles in combination with others features, i.e., NEs, semantic categories of noun and verb features in text classification. Table 6 shows that roles in combination with all NEs, semantic categories of both noun and verb features achieved the best result, and semantic categories of verb features (AllNEs+roles+V) achieved higher performance than those of noun features (AllNEs+roles+N). This result was not statistically significant, however. We further investigated the effects of roles on precision/recall measures. Table 6 shows that roles do not improve both simultaneously but rather that here is a trade-off: it improves precision but slightly reduces recall measures. The improvement of precision are +10.52% (65.9% to 76.42%) to na\u00efve Bayes and +20.81% (65.97% to 86.78%) to SVM. However, recall is increased dramatically when adding both semantic categories of noun and verb features. We do not see a significant increase in terms of accuracy but there is significant difference in terms of recall. This experiment has indicated that semantic categories of noun and verb features, in combination with roles, helps to improve recall substantially. We also considered the effectiveness of the two algorithms, na\u00efve Bayes and SVM. Table 6 and Fig. 3 shows SVM consistently performed better than na\u00efve Bayes in terms of accuracy and F-score. We note however that na\u00efve Bayes achieved higher recall than SVM in almost all cases and is probably that is the reason why na\u00efve Bayes is widely used in practice. Table 7 shows the top 30 features with the highest information gain (IG) in the BioCaster gold standard corpus. IG is frequently employed as a method for identifying high quality features in the field of machine learning [37]. We observe that the value \u201ctrue\u201d for roles has the highest IG measure. It indicates the importance of the assignment of roles: if the role was assigned correctly, i.e., \u201ctrue\u201d, it would significantly improve the performance of text classification. Additionally, NEs (i.e., DISEASE, CONDITION, OUTBREAK, CONTROL, VIRUS, SYMPTOM), have high IG, indicating that their importance for this classification task. 5.2 Effectiveness of case The experimental results for classification performance using case are shown in Table 8 . We first consider case which is associated with PERSON in the BioCaster annotation schema. Comparative F-score measures of case in combination with PERSON is shown in Fig. 4 . It is interesting to see that case in combination with PERSON achieved the best result compared to case only or PERSON. It improved 4.00% on na\u00efve Bayes (83.9% vs. 78.90%) and 4.38% on SVM (85.54% vs. 80.16%), a statistically significant difference. Moreover, there was a statistically significant difference between PERSON+case and PERSON. We can draw the conclusion that using case help improve the performance at a statistically significant level. Looking at Table 3, we see that the frequency of case is very high compared to others. We believe this is the reason why we can see clearly its effect on performance. 5.3 Effectiveness of transmission and therapeutic Since the frequency of transmission and therapeutic in the corpus is much lower than case their potential effectiveness can naturally be assumed to be less. We can see that there is little difference in the performance with transmission and therapeutic. The t-test showed that there is no significance when adding transmission and therapeutic with their NEs, i.e., ANATOMY, NONHUMAN and PRODUCT, CHEMICAL. However it is interesting to speculate on their likely effects as seen in the results. From Table 8, we can see that transmission is beneficial, while therapeutic is detrimental to performance. Specifically, transmission appears to improves both F-score and accuracy for ANATOMY, NONHUMAN, and PRODUCT while therapeutic appears to reduces CHEMICAL and PRODUCT. After we examined the corpus in detail we found that one possible explanation for why only therapeutic has this negative effect is that it has \u201cthe situation dependency obtained from extending types\u201d discussed in [15]. The category of substances with the therapeutic role has a similar status to \u201cweapon\u201d and \u201ctable\u201d, in that it includes substances which are essentially therapeutic, in addition to those mentioned as therapeutic only in some context. This may have caused the situation where substances with therapeutic roles are mentioned so often in the irrelevant articles, which do not report any therapeutic practice such as chronic diseases or vaccination campaigns. In contrast, case and transmission are assigned to the entities which are mentioned as disease cases and sources of infection only temporarily, in some limited contexts. This means that the assignment of these roles are usually related to the existence of disease events reported in the article. On the basis of the evidence presented in Table 8, we can rank the three roles according to their decreasing power: case, transmission, therapeutic. It is interesting to consider the effect of each NE in Table 9 . Compared to the frequency of NEs in Table 3 we saw that NEs which have high frequency effect much on performance. NEs with high frequency\u2014like PERSON, LOCATION, DISEASE and CONDITION\u2014have strong positive effect on performance. With NEs of much low frequency\u2014like PROTEIN, DNA, RNA\u2014this effect is reduced. It is noticable that, compared to the baseline, TIME tends to reduce performance for both algorithms, i.e., 77.57% vs. 81.70% F-score for na\u00efve Bayes and 77.44% vs. 80.16% for SVM. In our opinion, this is natural as there is no obvious correlation between time and relevancy. We also notice that the most frequent NEs relating to disease outbreak, e.g., PERSON, LOCATION, DISEASE, CONDITION help improve performance for both algorithms. For the remaining NEs, we see only slightly changes in performance because of their low frequency in the corpus. 6 Conclusion This paper has focused on the contribution of roles in biomedical annotated text classification, adding to the growing evidence that roles can be useful in practical text mining applications. More specifically, we have produced two main results: \u2022 Roles in combination with NEs, semantic categories of noun and verb features appear to contribute to the improvement of text classification, in particular to the recall measure. \u2022 Of the three roles, case improves the performance of text classification, transmission appears to improve while therapeutic appears to reduce the performance slightly. The effect of roles on NEs decreased in the order: case, transmission, therapeutic. In the future, we plan to use other methods for augmenting bag-of-words representations with more linguistically oriented features. It is hoped that the use of domain sensitive n-grams may help improve classification performance [9]. Additionally, we are currently experimenting with the use of a semantic tagger [25] to generate feature representations appropriate for the disease outbreak report classification task.

In the annotation schema of BioCaster, a text mining system for public health protection, important concepts that reflect information about infectious diseases were conceptually analyzed with a formal ontological methodology and classified into types and roles. Types are specified as NE classes and roles are integrated into NEs as attributes such as a chemical and whether it is being used as a therapy for some infectious disease. We focus on the roles of NEs and explore different ways to extract, combine and use them as features in a text classifier. In addition, we investigate the combination of roles with semantic categories of disease-related nouns and verbs. Experimental results using na\u00efve Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms show that: (1) roles in combination with NEs improve performance in text classification, (2) roles in combination with semantic categories of noun and verb features contribute substantially to the improvement of text classification. Both these results were statistically significant compared to the baseline \u201craw text\u201d representation. We discuss in detail the effects of roles on each NE and on semantic categories of noun and verb features in terms of accuracy, precision/recall and F-score measures for the text classification task.", "openArchiveArticle": "true", "prism:coverDate": "2009-10-31", "openaccessUserLicense": "http://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/", "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1532046408001494", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Doan, Son"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Kawazoe, Ai"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Conway, Mike"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Collier, Nigel"}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1532046408001494"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046408001494"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": "Full", "pii": "S1532-0464(08)00149-4", "prism:volume": "42", "prism:publisher": "Elsevier Inc.", "dc:title": "Towards role-based filtering of disease outbreak reports", "prism:copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Inc.
