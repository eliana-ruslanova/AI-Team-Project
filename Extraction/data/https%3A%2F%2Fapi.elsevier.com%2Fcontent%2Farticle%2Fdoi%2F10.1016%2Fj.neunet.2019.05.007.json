In this paper, we propose an inductive Robust Auto-weighted Low-Rank and Sparse Representation (RALSR) framework by joint feature embedding for the salient feature extraction of high-dimensional data. Technically, the model of our RALSR seamlessly integrates the joint low-rank and sparse recovery with robust salient feature extraction. Specifically, RALSR integrates the adaptive locality preserving weighting, joint low-rank/sparse representation and the robustness-promoting representation into a unified model. For accurate similarity measure, RALSR computes the adaptive weights by minimizing the joint reconstruction errors over the recovered clean data and salient features simultaneously, where L1-norm is also applied to ensure the sparse properties of learnt weights. The joint minimization can also potentially enable the weight matrix to have the power to remove noise and unfavorable features by reconstruction adaptively. The underlying projection is encoded by a joint low-rank and sparse regularization, which can ensure it to be powerful for salient feature extraction. Thus, the calculated low-rank sparse features of high-dimensional data would be more accurate for the subsequent classification. Visual and numerical comparison results demonstrate the effectiveness of our RALSR for data representation and classification.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Auto-weighted low-rank and sparse recovery"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Robust representation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Feature extraction"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Classification"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S089360801930139X", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089360801930139X", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85066465611", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85066465611", "pubmed-id": "31174048", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85066465611", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20190524", "$": "2019-05-24"}}}}}
