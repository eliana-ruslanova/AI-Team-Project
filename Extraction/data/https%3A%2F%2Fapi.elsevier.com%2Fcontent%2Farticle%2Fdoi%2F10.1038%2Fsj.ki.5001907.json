We think that support vector machine is a very effective and promising method. Nevertheless, we think that a different ANN approach should be used. In our opinion, the authors should better explain what they mean by ANN. In fact, ANN is a wide family of different algorithms and methods. We could suppose that the ANN used in the work is a Multi-Layer-Perceptron with Backpropagation algorithm. In any case, stating \u2018support vector machine outperformed ANN\u2019 by testing only one kind of ANN seems not appropriate. Besides, the authors say \u2018training and testing should be performed more than once and test set performances averaged out, to reduce the variance of the performance estimate\u2019. It is well known that every training performed by an ANN is unique, owing to many intrinsic characteristics, as, for example, the randomly selected starting weights. 2 Every training has its own history and results. If we average out these results, changing the test-set each time, we find a medium value of a particular kind of ANN. It is a statistical measure of different things. It could be more interesting to train several ANNs, test them once, and take the best. There are many ways to understand whether the training and testing subsets have been chosen correctly. For example, a third subset of the database can be used as a validation set. 3 We suggest that different ANN approaches and further tests should be carried out before asserting \u2018support vector machine outperformed ANN\u2019.
