Spikes are generated from the retina in response to relative changes in illumination at the pixel level and transmitted to a feed-forward spiking neural network. Neurons become sensitive to patterns of pixels with correlated activation times, in a fully unsupervised scheme. This is achieved using a special form of Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity which depresses synapses that did not recently contribute to the post-synaptic spike activation, regardless of their activation time. Competitive learning is implemented with lateral inhibition. When tested with real-life data, the system is able to extract complex and overlapping temporally correlated features such as car trajectories on a freeway, after only 10\u00a0min of traffic learning. Complete trajectories can be learned with a 98% detection rate using a second layer, still with unsupervised learning, and the system may be used as a car counter. The proposed neural network is extremely robust to noise and it can tolerate a high degree of synaptic and neuronal variability with little impact on performance. Such results show that a simple biologically inspired unsupervised learning scheme is capable of generating selectivity to complex meaningful events on the basis of relatively little sensory experience.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Spiking neural network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Spike-timing-dependent plasticity"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Unsupervised learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Features extraction"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Dynamic vision sensor"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Silicon retina"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608012000512", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608012000512", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84861765357", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84861765357", "pubmed-id": "22386501", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84861765357", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20120214", "$": "2012-02-14"}}}}}
