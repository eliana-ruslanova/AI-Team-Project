Success in the design and execution of population-based association studies to identify those genetic and environmental factors that play an important role in human disease will depend on our ability to embrace, rather that ignore, complexity in the genotype to phenotype mapping relationship for any given human ecology. We review here three general computational challenges that must be addressed. First, data mining and machine learning methods are needed to model nonlinear interactions between multiple genetic and environmental factors. Second, filter and wrapper methods are needed to identify attribute interactions in large and complex solution landscapes. Third, visualization methods are needed to help interpret computational models and results. We provide here an overview of the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method that was developed for addressing each of these challenges.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123808622000059", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123808622000059", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "77958469463", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-77958469463", "pubmed-id": "21029850", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77958469463", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20101026", "$": "2010-10-26"}}}}}
