First, it is proved that a one-layer projection neural network has a property that its equilibria are in one-to-one correspondence with the Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker points of the constrained optimization problem. Next, a collective neurodynamic optimization approach is developed by utilizing a group of recurrent neural networks in framework of particle swarm optimization by emulating the paradigm of brainstorming. Each recurrent neural network carries out precise constrained local search according to its own neurodynamic equations. By iteratively improving the solution quality of each recurrent neural network using the information of locally best known solution and globally best known solution, the group can obtain the global optimal solution to a nonconvex optimization problem. The advantages of the proposed collective neurodynamic optimization approach over evolutionary approaches lie in its constraint handling ability and real-time computational efficiency. The effectiveness and characteristics of the proposed approach are illustrated by using many multimodal benchmark functions.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Collective neurodynamic optimization"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Recurrent neural network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Nonconvex optimization"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608014000604", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608014000604", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84897517330", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84897517330", "pubmed-id": "24705545", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84897517330", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20140328", "$": "2014-03-28"}}}}}
