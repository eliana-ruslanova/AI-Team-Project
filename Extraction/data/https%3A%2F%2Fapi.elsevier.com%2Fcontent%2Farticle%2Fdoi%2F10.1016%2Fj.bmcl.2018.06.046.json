When it comes to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors, numerous tools enabled by advancement of computer science have been developed and are now routinely utilized. However, there are many aspects of the drug discovery process, which can further benefit from refinement of computational methods and tools, as well as improvement of accessibility of these new technologies. In this review, examples of recent developments in machine learning application are described, which have the potential to impact different parts of the drug discovery and development flow scheme. Notably, new deep learning-based approaches across compound design and synthesis, prediction of binding, activity and ADMET properties, as well as applications of genetic algorithms are highlighted.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960894X1830547X", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960894X1830547X", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85049445453", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85049445453", "pubmed-id": "30122222", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85049445453", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20180628", "$": "2018-06-28"}}}}}
