The principal processes are as follows: (1) capture a region of the ROI values as a graphic file for OCR, (2) recognize the text from the captured image by OCR software, (3) perform error-correction, (4) extract the values including area, average, standard deviation, max, and min values from the text, (5) reformat the values into temporary strings with tabs, and (6) paste the temporary strings into the spreadsheet. This principal process was repeated for the number of ROIs. The accuracy of this module was evaluated on 1040 recognitions from 280 randomly selected ROIs of the magnetic resonance images. The input times of ROIs were compared between conventional manual method and this extraction module-assisted input method.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  The module for extracting ROI values operated successfully using the OCR and macro programs. The values of the area, average, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum could be recognized and error-corrected with AutoHotkey-coded module. The average input\u00a0times using the conventional method and the proposed module-assisted method were 34.97 seconds and 7.87 seconds, respectively.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  A simple and efficient method for ROI value extraction was developed with open-source OCR and a macro program. Accurate inputs of various numbers from ROIs can be extracted with this module. The proposed module could be applied to the next generation of PACS or existing PACS that have not yet been upgraded.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Computers in medicine"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "PACS"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "OCR"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "region of interest"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1076633214002475", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1076633214002475", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84919496400", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84919496400", "pubmed-id": "25127847", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84919496400", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20140812", "$": "2014-08-12"}}}}}
