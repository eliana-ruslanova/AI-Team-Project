This type generalizes systems of complex numbers and hypercomplex numbers, which serve as the basis of mathematical natural sciences and many technologies. The new systems of multi-dimensional numbers have interesting mathematical properties and are called in a general case as \u201csystems of united-hypercomplex numbers\u201d (or briefly \u201cU-hypercomplex numbers\u201d). They can be widely used in models of multi-parametrical systems in the field of algebraic biology, artificial life, devices of biological inspired artificial intelligence, etc. In particular, an application of U-hypercomplex numbers reveals hidden properties of genetic alphabets under cyclic permutations in their doublets and triplets. A special attention is devoted to the author\u2019s hypothesis about a multi-linguistic in DNA-sequences in a relation with an ensemble of U-numerical sub-alphabets. Genetic multi-linguistic is considered as an important factor to provide noise-immunity properties of the multi-channel genetic coding. Our results attest to the conformity of the algebraic properties of the U-numerical systems with phenomenological properties of the DNA-alphabets and with the complementary device of the double DNA-helix. It seems that in the modeling field of algebraic biology the genetic-informational organization of living bodies can be considered as a set of united-hypercomplex numbers in some association with the famous slogan of Pythagoras \u201cthe numbers rule the world\u201d.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Genetic code"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Matrix"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hypercomplex numbers"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Cyclic permutations"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Inherited properties"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Algebraic biology"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0303264717301120", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303264717301120", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85020032588", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85020032588", "pubmed-id": "28535929", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85020032588", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20170520", "$": "2017-05-20"}}}}}
