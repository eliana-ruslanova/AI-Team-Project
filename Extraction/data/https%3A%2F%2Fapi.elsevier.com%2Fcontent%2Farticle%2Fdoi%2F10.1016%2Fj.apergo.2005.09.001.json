It begins with an explanation for the range of interest and viewpoints, and moves on to a discussion of the nature and study of expertise. The diversity in definitions, domains, disciplines, and the impact of these factors on approaches to investigation, are offered as possible explanations for some of the differences that appear to run through the literature. Specific attention is given to issues that may concern ergonomists interested in understanding expertise from the perspective of work in complex and dynamic settings. We suggest a move away from traditional novice-expert experimental designs to study of work in a naturalistic way, studying tasks and activities that are sufficiently challenging so that real expertise can be elicited.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Expertise"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Work systems design"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Methodology"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003687005001262", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687005001262", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "27744580612", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-27744580612", "pubmed-id": "16256934", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/27744580612", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20051027", "$": "2005-10-27"}}}}}
