In this paper, Morse code is selected as a communication adaptive device for persons who suffer from muscle atrophy, cerebral palsy or other severe handicaps. A stable typing rate is strictly required for Morse code to be effective as a communication tool. Therefore, an adaptive automatic recognition method with a high recognition rate is needed. The proposed system uses both fuzzy support vector machines and the variable-degree variable-step-size least-mean-square algorithm to achieve these objectives. We apply fuzzy memberships to each point, and provide different contributions to the decision learning function for support vector machines. Statistical analyses demonstrated that the proposed method elicited a higher recognition rate than other algorithms in the literature.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Morse code"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Least-mean-square algorithm"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Support vector machines"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Fuzzy theory"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1350453305002663", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350453305002663", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "33747777815", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-33747777815", "pubmed-id": "16807054", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33747777815", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20060627", "$": "2006-06-27"}}}}}
