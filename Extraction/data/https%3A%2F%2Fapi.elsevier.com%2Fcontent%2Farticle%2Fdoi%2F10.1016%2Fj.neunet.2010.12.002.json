This phenomenon has recently received much attention in empirical research that was not accompanied by a corresponding work effort in cognitive modeling. The new model is called TEnsor LEarning of CAusal STructure (TELECAST). In TELECAST, implicit processing is modeled using an unsupervised connectionist network (the Joint Probability EXtractor: JPEX) while explicit (causal) knowledge is implemented using a Bayesian belief network (which is built online using JPEX). Every task is simultaneously processed explicitly and implicitly and the results are integrated to provide the model output. Here, TELECAST is used to simulate a causal inference task and two serial reaction time experiments.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Psychology"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Bottom-up learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Implicit learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hebbian learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Bayesian learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Connectionist network"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608010002467", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608010002467", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "79951516119", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-79951516119", "pubmed-id": "21239141", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79951516119", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20101216", "$": "2010-12-16"}}}}}
