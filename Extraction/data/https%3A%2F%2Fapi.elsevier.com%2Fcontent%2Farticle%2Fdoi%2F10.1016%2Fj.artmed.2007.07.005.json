We calculated and compared the performance of each interestingness measure to estimate a medical expert\u2019s interest using f-measure and correlation coefficient. We then conducted a similar experiment for hepatitis.\n               \n               \n                  Results and conclusion\n                  The comprehensive results of experiments on meningitis and hepatitis indicate that the interestingness measures, accuracy, chi-square measure for one quadrant, relative risk, uncovered negative, and peculiarity, have a stable, reasonable performance in estimating real human interest in the medical domain. The results also indicate that the performance of interestingness measures is influenced by the certainty of a hypothesis made by the medical expert, and that the combinational use of interestingness measures will contribute to support medical experts to generate and confirm their hypotheses through human\u2013system interaction.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Data mining"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Knowledge discovery in databases"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Interestingness"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Postprocessing"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Clinical data"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0933365707000929", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365707000929", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "35648950495", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-35648950495", "pubmed-id": "17851054", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/35648950495", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20070911", "$": "2007-09-11"}}}}}
