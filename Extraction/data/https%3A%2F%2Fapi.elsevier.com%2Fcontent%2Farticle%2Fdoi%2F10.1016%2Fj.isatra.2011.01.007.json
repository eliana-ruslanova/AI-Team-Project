To overcome the interference of each sub-system and simplify the controller design, the proposed model reference decentralized adaptive control scheme constructs a decoupled well-designed reference model first. Then, according to the well-designed model, this paper develops a digital decentralized adaptive tracker based on the optimal analog control and prediction-based digital redesign technique for the sampled-data large-scale coupling system. In order to enhance the tracking performance of the digital tracker at specified sampling instants, we apply the iterative learning control (ILC) to train the control input via continual learning. As a result, the proposed iterative learning-based decentralized adaptive tracker not only has robust closed-loop decoupled property but also possesses good tracking performance at both transient and steady state. Besides, evolutionary programming is applied to search for a good learning gain to speed up the learning process of ILC.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Decentralized control"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Large-scale system"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Iterative learning control"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Adaptive control"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019057811000085", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019057811000085", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "79955915228", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-79955915228", "pubmed-id": "21333988", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79955915228", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20110218", "$": "2011-02-18"}}}}}
