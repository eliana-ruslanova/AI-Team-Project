This paper aims to go further in that direction by investigating the integration of emotion at the structural level of cognitive systems using the novel emotional DuoNeural Network (DuoNN). This network has hidden layer DuoNeurons, where each has two embedded neurons: a dorsal neuron and a ventral neuron for cognitive and emotional data processing, respectively. When input visual stimuli are presented to the DuoNN, the dorsal cognitive neurons process local features while the ventral emotional neurons process the entire pattern. We present the computational model and the learning algorithm of the DuoNN, the input information\u2013cognitive and emotional\u2013parallel streaming method, and a comparison between the DuoNN and a recently developed emotional neural network. Experimental results show that the DuoNN architecture, configuration, and the additional emotional information processing, yield higher recognition rates and faster learning and decision making.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Emotional neural networks"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Back propagation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Dorsal and ventral neurons"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Emotion and cognition"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Face recognition"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608010001267", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608010001267", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "78149495493", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-78149495493", "pubmed-id": "20674269", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/78149495493", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20100714", "$": "2010-07-14"}}}}}
