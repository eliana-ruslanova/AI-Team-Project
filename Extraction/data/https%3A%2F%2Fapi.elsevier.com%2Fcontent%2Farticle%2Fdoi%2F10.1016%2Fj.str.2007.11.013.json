IMAGE-HIGH-RES STFODE 1485 S0969-2126(08)00009-9 10.1016/j.str.2007.11.013 Elsevier Ltd Figure 1 Funnel Tip Ensembles for a Near-Native, TRUE, and Wrong, FALSE, Orientation Models were generated in a local docking run both for the near-native (TRUE; [B]) and another (FALSE; [A]) orientation (by using the free monomer conformations; Unbound U-U). The models of the cyclophilin-HIV capsid interaction (PDB ID: 1ak4) (Gamble et al., 1996) are plotted as interface energy versus interface rmsd (lower panels\u2014black points; see Experimental Procedures for more details). The upper panels show the conformations of the 25 models at the funnel tip (red in the plot) that represent each funnel in this study. Illustrations of protein structures were created by Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004). Figure 2 Robustness and Accuracy of the FunHunt Classifier FunHunt selects a top-ranking model from the TRUE funnel in 50/52 protein complexes (TopRank), and the classification accuracy is 78% in both leave-one-out (l1o) and leave-eight-out (l8o) tests. The error bars indicate the standard deviation. See text and Experimental Procedures for more details. Figure 3 FunHunt Performance Is General FunHunt TopRank performance on two subsets of complexes: EI and OTHER (see Table 1A and text for definition). We trained a classifier on three different datasets: a general dataset (All), a system-specific dataset (Specific), and a dataset without system-specific complexes (Excluded). Both for the EI and OTHER subset, the performance is similar (or only slightly better) when trained on a specific dataset. This indicates that FunHunt assesses general features that are not restricted to a subset. Figure 4 Orientation of Five Different Funnels in the Cyclophilin-HIV Capsid Interaction The native conformation (TRUE funnel) is indicated in red (PDB ID: 1ak4). The other colors describe FALSE funnels originating from low energy models. FunHunt can select the TRUE conformation out of the five (see Table 3).

Modeling of protein complex structures by RosettaDock often results in a set of low-energy conformations near the native structure. Ensembles of low-energy conformations can appear, however, in other regions, especially when backbone movements occur upon binding. What then characterizes the energy landscape near the correct orientation? We applied a machine learning algorithm to distinguish ensembles of low-energy conformations around the native conformation from other low-energy ensembles. The resulting classifier, FunHunt, identifies the native orientation in 50/52 protein complexes in a test set. The features used by FunHunt teach us about the nature of native interfaces. Remarkably, the energy decrease of trajectories toward near-native orientations is significantly larger than for other orientations. This provides a possible explanation for the stability of association in the native orientation. PROTEINS Introduction Understanding the basic principles that govern protein folding and binding, and how the structures of proteins and protein complexes are formed in nature, are long-standing goals. While there has been considerable debate as to the folding and binding processes themselves, it is agreed upon that in the general case the native conformation will be located in the global energy minimum of a broad basin in a rugged energy landscape (Dill and Chan, 1997; Onuchic et al., 1997). This has prompted prediction schemes to focus on a search for a broad minimum in the energy landscape of a realistic energy function. Low-energy conformations can be detected by energy minimization, while the breadth of a basin can be assessed by clustering low-energy conformations: larger clusters represent broader basins, where more simulation runs converge (Camacho et al., 1999; Shortle et al., 1998). The concept of the \u201cfolding funnel\u201d and energy-landscape theory has been developed as a qualitative description of various phenomena, including folding kinetic rates, the existence of multiple folding pathways, creation of partially folded intermediates, and others (Dill and Chan, 1997). Protein-protein association has been described by funnels in a corresponding binding energy landscape (Levy et al., 2005; Schlosshauer and Baker, 2004; Tsai et al., 1999). Recent advances in structural modeling indicate that high-resolution modeling is coming of age, both for \u201cde novo\u201d modeling of protein monomer structures, as well as for the docking of free monomers to produce protein complex structures (Gray, 2006; Schueler-Furman et al., 2005b). Key to this success is the evaluation by a realistic and adequate energy function, as well as the explicit modeling of conformational changes at atomic resolution. Docking programs that predict the protein complex structure starting from the monomers need to account for structural changes of the monomers that occur upon binding (Bastard et al., 2006; Bonvin, 2006; Dominguez et al., 2003; Fernandez-Recio et al., 2003; Schneidman-Duhovny et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2005). RosettaDock achieves this by explicitly modeling the amino acid side chains during the docking simulation (Gray et al., 2003) (an extension of the RosettaDock protocol models backbone conformational changes as well; Wang et al., 2007a). This modeling increases significantly the number of degrees of freedom and the associated computation time needed to locate the best solution. Conversely, native-like correct conformations are often clearly distinguished from incorrect alternative conformations, based on energy criteria alone (Schueler-Furman et al., 2005a). Within this context, an \u201cenergy funnel\u201d can be defined by an ensemble of models that are distinguished from the local background by their significantly lower energy score. This quantitative description of energy landscapes can be obtained by plotting the energy score for a set of models (created for example by Rosetta) as a function of their distance to the native structure. If the search algorithm and scoring functions are useful, we expect that the lowest-scoring decoys will be those that are the most similar to the native conformation, creating \u201cfunnels\u201d (Gray et al., 2003). Since the high-resolution energy landscape of RosettaDock is rugged, optimization protocols, such as the Monte-Carlo with Minimization procedure, will get stuck in many local minima and by that outline the energy landscape (rather than sampling the global energy minima only) (Schueler-Furman et al., 2005a, 2005b). Indeed, analysis of the sampled local minima conformations repeatedly revealed an energy landscape with a pronounced energy funnel around the native conformation (see Figure 1, lower panels, and Figure 2 in Schueler-Furman et al. [2005b]). This funnel, however, is not alone: recent docking simulations have indicated that dense sampling in other regions of conformational space reveal additional low-energy ensembles that define funnels for nonnative orientations of the protein partners. Moreover, the near-native funnel cannot be distinguished based on energy in cases when not all conformational changes upon binding are explicitly modeled, as for example small local backbone shifts. What then characterizes the near-native energy landscape? How can near-native funnels be distinguished from those additional funnels at alternative orientations? And more importantly, what can this teach us on the nature of protein-protein association and binding? This study describes FunHunt, a classifier that we devised to characterize and distinguish the near-native funnels from alternative funnels in other docking orientations. FunHunt was developed by applying the \u201csupport vector machine\u201d machine-learning technique (SVM) (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) to a set of models selected from near-native (TRUE) and alternative (FALSE) funnels. Those models were characterized by a set of features that includes both RosettaDock-related parameters, as well as additional parameters that characterize structures of protein complexes, such as interface size, packing, and evolutionary conservation. Previous analyses have shown that protein-protein interfaces show little common features and are rather diverse, although a combination of features can to some extent predict the location of interfaces (Bahadur et al., 2004; Bernauer et al., 2007; Bordner and Abagyan, 2005; Caffrey et al., 2004; Lo Conte et al., 1999; Neuvirth et al., 2004, 2007; Nooren and Thornton, 2003; Reichmann et al., 2007; Rodier et al., 2005). Description of the different interfaces by a set of features allowed us to characterize and separate near-native from nonnative funnels. We demonstrate here that a small subset of the features can be used by the classifier to successfully detect the native orientation among a set of low-energy funnels and investigate the meaning of those features in the context of protein-protein association and binding in general. Results We describe the design and calibration of the FunHunt classifier to distinguish between near-native low-energy ensembles (which we refer to as TRUE funnels in this study) and other low-energy ensembles in the energy landscape (referred to as FALSE funnels). We start with pairwise comparisons, where the native funnel is compared to one nonnative funnel, and proceed to the selection of the native funnel from a set of multiple funnels. The features that contribute to the distinction between TRUE and FALSE funnels are introduced here and investigated in more detail in the Discussion. We created a set of TRUE and FALSE funnels for each complex in the dataset listed in Table 1A and selected 25 models at each funnel tip as representatives (e.g., Figure 1). Then, we compiled a set of 42 different features that could be calculated for each of those models (Table S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). These feature vectors were then used by an SVM (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) to learn to classify TRUE and FALSE funnels. By applying recursive feature elimination (RFE) (see Experimental Procedures) we were able to reduce the number of features from 42 to 13 (shown in bold in Table S1; same features were retained in two independent RFE runs, data not shown). In an attempt to create a simple, stable, and efficient classifier, we further restricted this set to a few features that are mostly orthogonal to the RosettaDock energy function used for model generation. In addition, features with obvious correlation were removed. The final version of FunHunt includes seven features (see Table 2). FunHunt Is a Robust and General Classifier FunHunt succeeds well in picking the correct funnel between a TRUE and FALSE funnel ( Figure 2). In 50/52 of the protein complexes the top-ranked model by FunHunt belongs indeed to the TRUE funnel (leave-one-out cross validation; see Experimental Procedures). An average of 78% of the models are correctly classified (accuracy; see Experimental Procedures). Similar results using leave-one-out and leave-eight-out crossvalidation indicate that the method is robust to the selection of the training set. Also, results are comparable to those on a smaller dataset of 32 complexes (no monomer from any complex shows more than 70% sequence identity to any other monomer; data not shown). In order to assess the generality of FunHunt, we divided our dataset into three separate subsets: enzyme-inhibitor (EI), antibody-antigen (AB-AG), and the rest (OTHER) (see Table 1A). We then tested the classification performance when trained on: (1) all complexes, (2) complexes that belong to the subset only (system-specific training), and (3) complexes that do not belong to the subset (foreign training). A general classifier is expected to perform well in all three cases. Figure 3 shows that for both the EI and the OTHER subset, system-specific training improves performance slightly, compared to foreign training. However, this improvement is rather small, indicating that the features described above are general to protein-protein interactions. Near-Native Funnels Can Be Distinguished from Alternative Low-Energy Funnels by a Few Distinctive Features The weight vector used by FunHunt to discriminate between TRUE and FALSE funnels can be used to define characteristic features of TRUE funnels. The seven features, their weights, and the implication for models in TRUE funnels are summarized in Table 2 and described in the following: (1) D env \u2014amino acid interface propensity: near-native ensembles contain interface residues with amino acids of high propensity for the interface (e.g., aromatic residues at the center of the interface and polar/charged residues at the edges of the interface). This feature was assigned a weight of \u22120.81; since optimal D env values are negative, multiplication of the weight with the feature will result in a positive contribution to the final FunHunt score. (2) \u0394energy\u2014decrease in energy in the final full atom optimization steps: models with near-native orientations are obtained after a large drop in energy during full atom optimization. (3) AvgCon\u2014sequence conservation: near-native ensembles contain evolutionary conserved interface residues (as reported previously, e.g., Caffrey et al. [2004], Neuvirth et al. [2004], and Reichmann et al. [2007]). This feature was assigned a weight of \u22120.6; since highly conserved residues have negative AvgCon values, multiplication of the weight with the feature will again result in a positive contribution to the final FunHunt score. (4) SASA\u2014solvent accessible surface area: protein complexes in the near-native orientation have a smaller interface, which is reflected in a larger SASA. (5) Ncont\u2014number of contacts across the interface: near-native interfaces contain a higher number of contacts. (6) DHB bb \u2014unsatisfied buried interface hydrogen bond donors and acceptors: wrong orientations exhibit more unsatisfied buried interface hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, especially those that are mediated by backbone atoms. (7) Centroidity\u2014distance between the centers of mass of the protein partners: a minor contribution arises from the tendency of the monomer centers to stay farther apart in the near-native orientation. This is contrary to other studies on that subject (e.g., Ben-Shimon and Eisenstein [2005] and Nicola and Vakser [2007]) but could be due to the difference of how centroidity is measured (see Table 2). Comparison to Classification by Single Features We showed that the linear weighted combination of features used by FunHunt can distinguish between ensembles around the native orientations and other low-energy ensembles. To what degree can the individual features perform this task? Histograms for each of the features show mostly significant overlap, indicating poor distinction (see Figure S1). By selecting the best-scoring model, single features succeeded to a certain degree to define the native orientation: correct orientations were selected for 46 (by \u0394energy), 43 (D env ), 38 (SASA), and 36 (both AvgCon and Centroidity) of the 52 complexes. Still, the combination of features as defined by FunHunt is significantly better than for any of the features alone (50/52). Multiple Funnels We extended the analysis to the selection of a TRUE funnel from multiple funnels. For this analysis, we randomly picked two representatives from each of the complexes types (EI, AB-AG, OTHER) and created four additional FALSE funnels from minima in the energy landscape (see Figure 4 for an example). We then tested FunHunt on these new funnels in two ways: (1) pairwise comparison: for each of the FALSE funnels FunHunt was asked to discriminate between the TRUE funnel and that specific FALSE funnel (features were normalized on those two funnels). (2) Overall selection: FunHunt was asked to pick the TRUE funnel from the set of all five funnels (features were normalized on all five funnels). The results are summarized in Table 3. All but two pairwise comparisons were successful, and for 3/6 cases, the top-ranked models belonged to the TRUE funnel in the overall selection as well. Validations on Additional Sets of Complexes Even though the cross validation should effectively prevent overfitting, we decided to validate FunHunt on additional sets of protein complexes: (1) CAPRI targets: the critical assessment of predicted interactions (CAPRI) is a world-wide experiment for the blind assessment of docking approaches (Janin, 2005). FunHunt selects the correct orientation for all cases in a set of 12 CAPRI targets (London and Schueler-Furman, 2007). (2) We extracted additional protein complexes from recent releases of the PDB (January\u2013April 2007) (see Table 1B) FunHunt selected the TRUE Funnel for five out of these nine complexes, with accuracy of 74%. These evaluations demonstrate that FunHunt can in many cases improve prediction. Discussion Despite significant advances in high-resolution modeling of protein structure, it can still be difficult to select the correct model. This challenge has been addressed by various approaches aimed at selecting near-native conformations among alternative models and at ranking models according to their proximity to the correct conformation (e.g., Bernauer et al. [2007], Chelliah et al. [2006], Halperin et al. [2002], and Pierce and Weng [2007]). In this study, we analyze ensembles of low-energy conformations of protein complexes that represent the tip of funnels in the energy landscape of protein-protein binding. We show that these models can be used to define features that characterize the native orientation in comparison to incorrect low-energy orientations and thus teach us about critical contributions to protein-protein association and binding. In the following, we discuss what we have learned about protein-protein interactions from analysis of the RosettaDock energy landscape and conclude with an outlook on future applications. Implications of RosettaDock Energy Landscape on Protein-Protein Association The presence of energy funnels indicates that low-energy conformations are restricted to a small range of conformations. Funnels created by RosettaDock have been previously used to define the \u201ccapture radius\u201d\u2014where short-range interactions lead to a significant energy decrease that captures the protein partner and prevents it from diffusing out again (Schlosshauer and Baker, 2004). Protein-protein association can then be described as a two-step process consisting of free diffusion into a reactive zone in phase space. This simple model allows the adequate description of association rates between proteins, without considering more complicated long-range effects. Even though it is relatively small, the reactive zone is significant enough to allow for calculation of association rates that correspond to measured values (Schlosshauer and Baker, 2002). The current comprehensive study on energy funnels corroborates that orientational locking takes place in general within short range, mostly within 1\u20132 \u00c5 \u00b4 interface rmsd (up to 5 \u00c5 \u00b4 ligand rmsd). The orientations of the two partners are therefore already fairly similar when the short-range interactions responsible for binding start to \u201ckick in\u201d, a feature that has been termed \u201corientational frustration\u201d within the context of lattice simulations of protein oligomer assembly by different pathways (Dima and Thirumalai, 2002). Significant Contributions of Denv and \u0394energy Features Indicate that Protein-Protein Interactions Create an Optimal Interface Residue Environment and Involve a Significant Energy Drop During Binding RosettaDock searches the optimal rigid body orientation in two consecutive stages: first, a fast low-resolution step optimizes features that do not depend on the atomic details of the protein side chains. Denv describes the preference of amino acids for protein interfaces compared to the protein surface (Gray et al., 2003) (see Table 2 and Table S1). The weight of \u22120.81 for this feature indicates that near-native funnels contain models with significantly better residue environment scores than models taken from energy funnels elsewhere on the energy landscape ( Figure 5A). The low-resolution step is followed by a detailed high-resolution step that includes the optimization of side chain conformations along the way. FunHunt assigns a large weight to the energy decrease during this step (\u0394energy: +0.67) (Figure 5B). Therefore, although both TRUE and FALSE complexes lie at the tip of energy funnels, the full-atom minimization trajectory of models in near-native funnels decreases more in energy, reducing the probability of an escape out of such a funnel, and thereby stabilizing the complex. This indicates that the energy landscape around the native orientation might be less rugged and might explain why proteins associate in a specific orientation but not in another. The two features together indicate the fine balance between low-resolution and high-resolution optimization steps needed to locate the native orientation. This is in accordance with findings in a related study that found that near-native structures can be selected based on the vicinity of the structures minimized by RosettaDock from low-resolution cluster centers (Kosakov et al., 2007). Native conformations are expected to reside in broad energy basins of attraction, as these regions are easier to reach (Camacho et al., 1999; Shortle et al., 1998). In our case, the contribution of the low-resolution environment score might reflect the importance of a broad basin of attraction during protein-protein association, while the large energy decrease in the subsequent high-resolution binding step can account for the stability of the final complex due to its lower probability to escape the funnel. Interestingly, a similar idea has been explored by a model for protein-DNA binding that was aimed at finding a mechanism that could explain both a fast (low-resolution) search and a high stability of the (final) specific protein-DNA complex (Slutsky et al., 2004). Nonnative Orientations Can Be Identified by Their Large and Porous Interface FunHunt detects and eliminates models with large and porous interfaces by assessing the interface size and density. A scatter-plot of SASA versus Ncont demonstrates that a fraction of the FALSE models occupy a region characterized by a small number of contacts combined with large interface, which is readily eliminated by FunHunt (see Figure 5C). Interfaces are in general well packed and contain a large number of contacts (Ncont). Therefore, near-native models could easily be detected by the Ncont measure only. This is true if conformational changes are restricted to the monomer side chains: in these cases, high-resolution models can be created with a standard RosettaDock protocol (Schueler-Furman et al., 2005a; Wang et al., 2005). However, if the monomer backbone conformation changes upon binding, models that are based on the free backbone conformations cannot reproduce clash-free tight packing with a rigid backbone, and therefore Ncont is not a good classifier on its own (see Figure S1). FunHunt as Starting Point of Docking Refinement with Localized Backbone Flexibility Toward a global protocol for the modeling of these interactions, we propose a two-step protocol where the first step involves measures such as FunHunt that can detect near-native orientations. In a second step, they can serve as starting points for local docking with explicit backbone flexibility (Wang et al., 2007a). Since introducing full flexibility into RosettaDock increases significantly the conformation space to be searched, these models can be very useful as a guide to define restricted regions where localized backbone flexibility can help to model accurately the native structure. For example, the application of FunHunt to models from CAPRI Target18 selected the correct orientation unambiguously (London and Schueler-Furman, 2007), even though small clashes prevented us from correctly modeling the protein complex with rigid-backbone RosettaDock (Schueler-Furman et al., 2005a). Target 18 was successfully modeled with flexible-backbone RosettaDock (Wang et al., 2007b), suggesting that a combination of FunHunt with flexible RosettaDock might improve significantly the general docking performance of our protocol. Penalizing Unsatisfied Buried Hydrogen-Bond Donors and Acceptors Can Improve the RosettaDock Energy Function The satisfaction of the hydrogen-bonding potential of polar groups represents a significant challenge in the modeling of protein structure. Analysis of crystal structures indicates that buried polar groups are in general involved in hydrogen bonds or salt bridges and very rarely remain unsatisfied, even at the interface (McDonald and Thornton, 1994). Nevertheless, models often lack this feature: buried unsatisfied hydrogen bond donors and acceptors are more frequent in FALSE models, indicating that the solvation model in Rosetta should penalize more heavily for those incidences. FunHunt was developed with two goals in mind: the first was to investigate what characterizes native orientations of interacting proteins and the funnel in the energy landscape in which they are located. The second was to create a classifier that could be used to select the near-native funnel. Conformational changes of the backbone can prevent successful selection of near-native orientation based on energy criteria alone. We have presented a novel approach to the selection of models by using not the single model structure; rather, we use information about the funnel around this structure and the trajectories that lead to the funnel tip. The classifier indicates the importance of two interesting features: optimal interface residue environment and a large energy decrease during full atom minimization. These together indicate the fine balance between low- and high-resolution optimization steps needed to locate the native orientation. Once this native orientation is located, more intensive sampling that includes restricted backbone flexibility is possible. Conversely, it will be interesting to investigate how the energy landscape changes upon inclusion of additional degrees of freedom. Experimental Procedures Generation of Datasets Training and Test A set of 52 protein complexes was compiled from a widely used docking benchmark (Chen et al., 2003) and additional complexes from the Protein Data Bank, PDB (Berman et al., 2000) (see Table 1A). No complex shows sequence identity of >70% to any other complex (for both partners). Where available, the conformation of the free monomer was used (Unbound, U-U cases: 34/52); in the remaining cases, one of the partners is taken from the complex structure (mostly the antibody in antibody-antigen cases). Validation The performance of FunHunt was also evaluated on CAPRI targets (see London and Schueler-Furman [2007]), as well as on a different set of nine protein complexes extracted from the list of newly released structures (January\u2013April 2007) (see Table 1B). Generating Energy Funnels with RosettaDock Definition of Energy Funnel The notion of funnel and energy landscapes have mainly been used previously as qualitative picture descriptions of protein folding and binding. In this study, however, an energy funnel is defined as an ensemble of low-energy, similar docking models whose energy is significantly lower than the local background. We refer to TRUE funnels as near-native ensembles, while FALSE funnels represent ensembles of low-energy conformations at nonnative orientations in the energy landscape defined by the RosettaDock energy score. The basic assumption of this study is that after extensive minimization by RosettaDock, we can locate energy funnels in the energy landscape of all possible conformations. We then need an additional, orthogonal, protocol to select the correct funnel. The RosettaDock Protocol RosettaDock uses a Monte Carlo Minimization (MCM) (Li and Scheraga, 1987) strategy to sample rigid-body degrees of freedom, while treating side-chain flexibility explicitly (Gray et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2005). The search is guided by a physically based free-energy function dominated by an all-atom Lennard-Jones potential, solvation energy, and explicit hydrogen-bonding potential (Rohl et al., 2004). In order to locate the minimum energy conformation, a number of different starting orientations are optimized with the RosettaDock protocol, each producing a local minimum energy model in the rugged energy landscape. When there is no prior knowledge of the interaction site, a GLOBAL search is conducted: it randomly samples the entire conformational space and allows the location of potential minima on the energy landscape. A LOCAL search is conducted either when prior knowledge of the interface exists (which enables a localization of the search), or starting from low energy models obtained in a global search. Our previous studies have shown that initial random sampling (of 10,000 to 50,000 starting orientations) in a global search, followed by refinement of energy minima in a local search (by sampling around 500\u20131000 different orientations) can, in most cases, detect and select the near-native minimum energy conformation. In many cases, the local search results in a characteristic funnel around the minimum energy conformation. TRUE and FALSE Funnels In order to learn the differences between near-native and nonnative funnels in the energy landscape, we produced a set of energy funnels around minima located either near the native conformation (TRUE funnel) or at other orientations (FALSE funnels). A global search that optimized 15,000 different random starting orientations was used to locate low-energy models far from the native complex (the FALSE orientations). Energy funnels were then created by a local search that sampled 1000 orientations with an average of 3 \u00c5 translation and 8\u00b0 rotation. For each complex, the TRUE funnel was created starting from the native conformation. One or more FALSE funnels were created starting from the lowest energy FALSE orientation(s) located in the global search. Selection of Models for Analysis We devised a protocol to automatically select models to represent the tip of a funnel. For this purpose, we slid a window of 50 models along the rmsd axis (in reference to the starting orientation) and calculated for each window the average energy of the 50 models. The window with the lowest average energy was retained, and from this set, the 25 models with lowest energy were selected to represent the funnel tip for subsequent analysis and classification (see Figure 1 for an example). Characterization of Models by Features In order to distinguish between the TRUE and FALSE funnels, we compiled a list of 42 features that would describe the models (see Table S1). These include parameters that are part of the Rosetta energy function (Rohl et al., 2004). In addition, interface characteristics were measured, including the surface area buried upon binding, the size of the polar and apolar part of the interface, the number of contacts across the interface, sequence conservation at the interface (Glaser et al., 2005), secondary structures at the interface, distance between the monomers centers of mass (centroidity), and B factors. Values for each of the features were computed for the models of both the TRUE and the FALSE funnels (in total 50 models for each protein). In order to assure similar value ranges for different features, the values of each feature were normalized and described as Z scores: Zi p f = ( xi p f \u2212 \u03bc p f ) / \u03c3 p f . where i is a model (out of 50), p is the protein complex, f is the feature, and \u03bc pf and \u03c3 pf are the average and standard deviation of feature f in the 50 models (TRUE and FALSE sets) of protein p. Throughout this study, we use the normalized Z-score values to train and assess models. Classification of Models to TRUE and FALSE Funnels by SVM The support vector machine (SVM) method (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) belongs to a class of machine-learning algorithms that were developed to classify heterogeneous data of various kinds. SVM maps input samples from two classes to a high dimensional space (defined by the number of features) and seeks a separating hyperplane in this space. The chosen hyperplane maximizes the margin from the closest training samples and, at the same time, minimizes the error of outliers. After the hyperplane is found (based on the labeled training samples), each new sample can be labeled by its position relative to the separating hyperplane. For illustration, consider two populations of models described each by two features: the \u201chyperplane\u201d would be a line that separates values coming from the TRUE and FALSE populations into regions T and F, respectively. The \u201cmargin\u201d would be the nearest distance to this line of a TRUE model in region T, and a FALSE model in region F. \u201cErrors\u201d would correspond to TRUE models in region F and FALSE models in region T. We used the SVMlight implementation of the SVM algorithm (Joachims, 1999). The SVM was trained using a linear kernel, thus enabling the extraction of the weights assigned to each feature in the final model. SVM Performance Was Evaluated in Two Ways Leave-One-Out Crossvalidation Training was performed on all but one of the protein complexes in the data set (i.e., 25 true models and 25 false models were left out) and then tested on the left-out complex. This procedure was repeated for each of the protein complexes in the dataset. Leave-Eight-Out Crossvalidation Eight protein complexes were randomally extracted, the SVM was trained on the rest, and tested on the extracted eight. This procedure is also known as bootstrapping (Kohavi, 1995). We repeated the procedure 1024 times, and report the average accuracy. Feature Selection A new sample is classified according to its position relative to the hyperplane. This position is calculated by a scalar product of the weight vector (obtained from training the classifier) and the feature vector (calculated for the new sample): positive values indicate a TRUE model, while negative values a FALSE model. Therefore, the weight vector can teach us about the importance and contribution of different features: the ABSOLUTE value of each weight indicates the relative contribution of each feature. The SIGN of each weight in turn indicates the direction of this contribution: for instance, a positive large weight for Ncont indicates that TRUE models tend to contain a large number of contacts (a positive value will result from multiplication of the Ncont weight with the normalized value of Ncont\u2014positive in the case of TRUE). Not all features will contribute to the classification. After training the SVM on all features, we used recursive feature elimination (RFE-SVM) (Guyon et al., 2002) to define a small set of features that could be used for classification. Given a training and test set, this procedure extracts, at each iteration, the weights given by the linear kernel for each feature and removes the feature that contributes least to the separation. We divided the data set into two random subsets: feature elimination was then performed on one set (by leave-one-out cross validation) and evaluated on the other. When SVM performance is plotted against the number of features, a convergence to maximum performance is observed after removing a certain number of features, following which the performance drops rapidly if more features are removed. For each of the remaining features, histograms for both the TRUE and FALSE set of models were plotted to evaluate the ability of the feature alone to distinguish between TRUE and FALSE. ROC (receiver operating characteristics) (Swets, 1988) curves were plotted to quantify discrimination. Measure of Accuracy As described above, the classifier will assign a value to each model, based on the weight and feature vectors. Positive and negative values classify a model as a member of the TRUE and FALSE funnel, respectively. The SVM was trained to optimize the accuracy of distinction between models from TRUE and FALSE funnels. Accuracy is defined as: accuracy = T P + T N Total It describes the fraction of correctly classified models (TP\u2014true positives: models from TRUE funnel classified as TRUE; and TN\u2014true negatives: models from FALSE funnels classified as FALSE) among all models (Total). This measure is calculated over all models of all protein complexes. Our actual goal, however, is to select a model from the TRUE funnel (and not necessarily separate between all models). The reason for evaluating a population of models from the funnel tip was to allow for some variability of the funnel tip solution, which would improve the chances to obtain at least one model that could be selected by our new classifier. We therefore assessed for how many protein complexes FunHunt would select the correct funnel. That is, if the top ranking model belongs to the TRUE funnel or not: TopRank = number of protein complexes for which the top-ranking model belongs to the TRUE funnel The predicted complex in a comparison of more than one alternative FALSE funnel is selected as the funnel that contains the majority of the n top-ranking models\u2014where n is the number of FALSE funnels.

Modeling of protein complex structures by RosettaDock often results in a set of low-energy conformations near the native structure.

What then characterizes the energy landscape near the correct orientation? We applied a machine learning algorithm to distinguish ensembles of low-energy conformations around the native conformation from other low-energy ensembles. The resulting classifier, FunHunt, identifies the native orientation in 50/52 protein complexes in a test set. The features used by FunHunt teach us about the nature of native interfaces. Remarkably, the energy decrease of trajectories toward near-native orientations is significantly larger than for other orientations.
