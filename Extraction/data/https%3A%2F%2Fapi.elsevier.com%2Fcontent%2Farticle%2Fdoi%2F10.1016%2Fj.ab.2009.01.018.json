In this article, an optimal pseudo amino acid composition based on physicochemical characters of amino acids is suggested to represent proteins for predicting the subfamilies of nuclear receptors. Six physicochemical characters of amino acids were adopted to generate the protein sequence features via web server PseAAC. The optimal values of the rank of correlation factor and the weighting factor about PseAAC were determined to get the appropriate descriptor of proteins that leads to the best performance. A nonredundant dataset of nuclear receptors in four subfamilies is constructed to evaluate the method using support vector machines. An overall accuracy of 99.6% was achieved in the fivefold cross-validation test as well as the jackknife test, and an overall accuracy of 98.4% was reached in a blind dataset test. The performance is very competitive with that of some previous methods.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Nuclear receptors"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Subfamily prediction"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Physicochemical character"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Pseudo amino acid composition"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Support vector machines"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003269709000347", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003269709000347", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "60549096619", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-60549096619", "pubmed-id": "19454254", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/60549096619", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20090119", "$": "2009-01-19"}}}}}
