In particular, this article aims to answer two fundamental questions about imagery-based AI systems. First, what might visual imagery look like in an AI system, in terms of the internal representations used by the system to store and reason about knowledge? Second, what kinds of intelligent tasks would an imagery-based AI system be able to accomplish? The first question is answered by providing a working definition of what constitutes an imagery-based knowledge representation, and the second question is answered through a literature survey of imagery-based AI systems that have been developed over the past several decades of AI research, spanning task domains of: 1) template-based visual search; 2) spatial and diagrammatic reasoning; 3) geometric analogies and matrix reasoning; 4) naive physics; and 5) commonsense reasoning for question answering. This article concludes by discussing three important open research questions in the study of visual-imagery-based AI systems\u2014on evaluating system performance, learning imagery operators, and representing abstract concepts\u2014and their implications for understanding human visual mental imagery.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Knowledge representation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Analogical representations"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Depictive versus\u00a0descriptive"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Iconic versus propositional"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Modal versus\u00a0amodal"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010945218300595", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945218300595", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85049357535", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85049357535", "pubmed-id": "29980282", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85049357535", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20180227", "$": "2018-02-27"}}}}}
