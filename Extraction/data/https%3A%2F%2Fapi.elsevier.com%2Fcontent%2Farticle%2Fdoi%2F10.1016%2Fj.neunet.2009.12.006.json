By training the model, each expert learns a primitive sequence pattern, and a gating network learns to imitate stochastic switching of the multiple primitives via chaotic dynamics, utilizing a sensitive dependence on initial conditions. As a demonstration, we present a numerical simulation in which the model learns Markov chain switching among some Lissajous curves by chaotic dynamics. Our analysis shows that by using a sufficient amount of training data, balanced with the network memory capacity, it is possible to satisfy the conditions for embedding the target stochastic sequences into a chaotic dynamical system. It is also shown that reconstruction of a stochastic time series by a chaotic model can be stabilized by adding a negligible amount of noise to the dynamics of the model.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Recurrent neural network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Mixture of experts"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Maximum likelihood estimation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Chaos"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608009003244", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608009003244", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "77952290064", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-77952290064", "pubmed-id": "20045751", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77952290064", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20091223", "$": "2009-12-23"}}}}}
