We should expect it, embrace it, and try to predict its direction. Dermatology, as a specialty practice, has been changing rapidly over the past 30 years concurrent with the changes in medicine. What are these changes, how did they come about, and what may be the consequences? The goal of this review is to follow the march of time, as we move from one era to the other in step with what is happening in the world as a whole and the United States in particular. The growth of our specialty, Dermatology, is divided into 3 eras which are quite different in generational cultures. The first era spanning the 1980s and 1990s is dubbed as \u201cold school.\u201d The second era begins with the new century, 2000 until today. This era will forever be remembered as the business era, the rise of elite cultures, and the losses and threats to academia. The third era begins now; it is that of technology which is fast progressing into the future. One can theoretically project what may occur during this technologic revolution and the directions in medicine as a whole. Dermatology can be at the forefront of this era or it could be lost as a whole if we do nothing to keep up. These eras are based on my personal experience as a dermatologist in a large academic institution in the United States and may not apply to other communities or societies elsewhere. The United States serves as a good example of a western technologically oriented society that is often emulated by others.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0738081X18301950", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738081X18301950", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85058195081", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85058195081", "pubmed-id": "30554621", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85058195081", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20180915", "$": "2018-09-15"}}}}}
