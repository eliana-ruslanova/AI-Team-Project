Learning from experience in an individual\u2019s unique context generally improves expert performance, despite the risks inherent in brain dynamics that can transform previously reliable expectations. Designers of twenty-first century technologies face the challenges and responsibilities posed by fielded systems that continue to learn on their own. The neural model Self-supervised ART, which can acquire significantly new knowledge in unpredictable contexts, is an example of one such system.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Self-supervised learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Semi-supervised learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Neural networks"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial Intelligence (AI)"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART)"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Self-supervised (ART)"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608019302837", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608019302837", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85073050460", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85073050460", "pubmed-id": "31607596", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073050460", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20191010", "$": "2019-10-10"}}}}}
