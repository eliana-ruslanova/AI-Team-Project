We find that the system is characterized by a rich variety of stable states, including pure states, parallel retrieval states, hierarchically organized states and symmetric mixtures (remarkably, both even and odd), whose complexity increases as the number of patterns \n                        P\n                      grows. The analysis is performed both analytically and numerically: Exploiting techniques based on partial differential equations, we are able to get the self-consistencies for the order parameters. Such self-consistency equations are then solved and the solutions are further checked through stability theory to catalog their organizations into the phase diagram, which is outlined at the end. This is a further step towards the understanding of spontaneous parallel processing in associative networks.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hopfield model"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Statistical mechanics"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Multitasking networks"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608013002414", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608013002414", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84885228129", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84885228129", "pubmed-id": "24121044", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84885228129", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20130930", "$": "2013-09-30"}}}}}
