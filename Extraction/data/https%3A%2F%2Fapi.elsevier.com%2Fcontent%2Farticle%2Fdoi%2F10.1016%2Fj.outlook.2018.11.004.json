Data were collected using five sensor types (infrared motion, contact, light, temperature, and humidity). Nurses used telehealth and home visitation to collect health data and provide ground truth annotation for training intelligent algorithms using raw sensor data containing health events.\n               \n               \n                  Findings\n                  Nurses assisting with the development of health-assistive AI may encounter unique challenges and opportunities. We recommend: (a) using a practical and consistent method for collecting field data, (b) using nurse-driven measures for data analytics, (c) multidisciplinary communication occur on an engineering-preferred platform.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  Practical frameworks to guide nurse investigators integrating clinical data with sensor data for training machine learning algorithms may build capacity for nurses to make significant contributions to developing AI for health-assistive Smart Homes.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Smart home"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Sensors"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial intelligence"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Ground truth"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Mixed methods"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Data processing"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Conceptual model"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Aging-in-place"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0029655418304421", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029655418304421", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85058141592", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85058141592", "pubmed-id": "30551883", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85058141592", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20181123", "$": "2018-11-23"}}}}}
