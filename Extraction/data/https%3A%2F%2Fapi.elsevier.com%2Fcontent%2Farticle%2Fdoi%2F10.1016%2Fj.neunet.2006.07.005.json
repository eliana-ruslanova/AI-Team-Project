B. (1996). A survey and critique of techniques for extracting rules from trained artificial neural networks. Knowledge-Based Systems, 8, 373\u2013389]. This paper starts with a survey of algorithms which attempt to explain the ANN output. We then present HYPINV,\n                        1\n                     \n                     \n                        1\n                        HYPINV stands for an algorithm which extracts HYPerplanes using INVersion.\n                      a new explanation algorithm which relies on network inversion; i.e.\u00a0calculating the ANN input which produces a desired output. HYPINV is a pedagogical algorithm, that extracts rules, in the form of hyperplanes. It is able to generate rules with arbitrarily desired fidelity, maintaining a fidelity\u2013complexity tradeoff. To our knowledge, HYPINV is the only pedagogical rule extraction method, which extracts hyperplane rules from continuous or binary attribute neural networks. Different network inversion techniques, involving gradient descent as well as an evolutionary algorithm, are presented. An information theoretic treatment of rule extraction is presented. HYPINV is applied to example synthetic problems, to a real aerospace problem, and compared with similar algorithms using benchmark problems.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Rule extraction"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Neural network explanation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Explanation capability of neural networks"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Inversion"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hyperplanes"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Evolutionary algorithm"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Pedagogical"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608006001730", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608006001730", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "33845679519", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-33845679519", "pubmed-id": "17029713", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33845679519", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20061006", "$": "2006-10-06"}}}}}
