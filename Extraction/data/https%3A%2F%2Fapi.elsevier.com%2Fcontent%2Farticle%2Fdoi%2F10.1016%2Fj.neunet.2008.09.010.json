Such a manifold representation can be learned using a novel recurrent neural network based learning algorithm. Unlike the conventional recurrent neural network model in which the memory is stored in an attractive fixed point at discrete locations in the state space, the dynamics of the proposed learning algorithm represent memory as a nonlinear line of attraction. The region of convergence around the nonlinear line is defined by the statistical characteristics of the training data. This learned manifold can then be used as a basis for color correction of the images having different color perception to the learned color perception. Experimental results show that the proposed recurrent neural network learning algorithm is capable of color balance the lighting variations in images captured in different environments successfully.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Associative memory"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Nonlinear line of attraction"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Pattern association"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Perceptual color constancy"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Recurrent neural network"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608008001949", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608008001949", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "58249085182", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-58249085182", "pubmed-id": "18995987", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/58249085182", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20081009", "$": "2008-10-09"}}}}}
