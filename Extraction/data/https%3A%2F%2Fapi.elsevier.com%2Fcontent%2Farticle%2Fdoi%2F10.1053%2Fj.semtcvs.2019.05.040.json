The use of AI has evolved from basic image-based analysis into complex decisions related to different surgical procedure. AI has been very widely used in the cardiology field, however the use of such machine-led decisions has been limited and explored at slower pace in surgical practice. The use of AI in cardiac surgery is still at its infancy but growing dramatically to reflect the changes in the clinical decision making process for better patient outcomes. The machine-led but human controlled algorithms will soon be taking over most of the decision making processes in cardiac surgery. This review article focuses on the practice of AI in aortic surgery and the future of such technology-led decision making pathways on patient outcomes, surgeon's learning skills and adaptability.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Big data"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Machine learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial intelligence"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Aortic surgery"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S104306791930156X", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S104306791930156X", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85069856207", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85069856207", "pubmed-id": "31279913", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85069856207", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20190704", "$": "2019-07-04"}}}}}
