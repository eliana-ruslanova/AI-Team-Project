Computational approaches using classic (quantitative) structure\u2013activity relationships ((Q)SAR), probabilistic reasoning, machine learning methods, and human expert rule-based systems were employed to deliver human hepatobiliary adverse effect predictions. The objective is to profile and analyze constituents that are alerting for the human hepatobiliary adverse effects. Computational analysis of positively predicted constituents showed that common structural features contributing to the hepatobiliary adverse effect predictions contain phenolic, flavone, isoflavone, glucoside conjugated flavone and isoflavone, and 4-hydroxyacetophenone structures. Specifically, protocatechuic acid from black cohosh, benzofuran and 4-vinylphenol from chasteberry, and xanthohumol I from hops were botanical constituents predicted positive for liver toxicity endpoints and were also confirmed with literature findings. However, comparison between the estimated human exposure to these botanical constituents and the LOAEL and NOAEL in published animal liver toxicology studies for these constituents demonstrated varying margins of safety. This study will serve as regulatory decision support information for regulators at the FDA to help with the process of prioritizing chemicals for testing.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Botanicals"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Safety"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Dietary supplements"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Computational science"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "QSAR"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Modeling"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Liver toxicity"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Women\u2019s health"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Menopausal symptoms"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Menopause"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hormone replacement therapy"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Black cohosh"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Chasteberry"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hops"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Red clover"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0273230010001741", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230010001741", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "78751575350", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-78751575350", "pubmed-id": "20920542", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/78751575350", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20101002", "$": "2010-10-02"}}}}}
