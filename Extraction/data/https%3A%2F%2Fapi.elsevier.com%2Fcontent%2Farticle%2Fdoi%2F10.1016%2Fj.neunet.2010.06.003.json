While early research and development in artificial intelligence (AI) focused on processing and production of natural language, the \u201cnew AI\u201d has also taken into account the emotional and relational aspects of communication with an emphasis both on understanding and production of nonverbal behavior. This shift in attention in computer science and engineering is reflected in recent developments in psychology and social cognitive neuroscience. This article addresses key challenges which emerge from the goal to equip machines with socio-emotional intelligence and to enable them to interpret subtle nonverbal cues and to respond to social affordances with naturally appearing behavior from both perspectives. In particular, we propose that the creation of credible artificial humans not only defines the ultimate test for our understanding of human communication and social cognition but also provides a unique research tool to improve our knowledge about the underlying psychological processes and neural mechanisms.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial humans"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Nonverbal communication"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Social psychology"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Social cognitive neuroscience"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608010001164", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608010001164", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "77957859545", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-77957859545", "pubmed-id": "20620019", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77957859545", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20100616", "$": "2010-06-16"}}}}}
