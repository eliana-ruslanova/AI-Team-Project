Three known strategies for the long-term time series prediction i.e. Recursive, Direct and DirRec are considered in combination with OP-ELM and compared with a baseline linear least squares model and Least-Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVM). Among these three strategies DirRec is the most time consuming and its usage with nonlinear models like LS-SVM, where several hyperparameters need to be adjusted, leads to relatively heavy computations. It is shown that OP-ELM, being also a nonlinear model, allows reasonable computational time for the DirRec strategy. In all our experiments, except one, OP-ELM with DirRec strategy outperforms the linear model with any strategy. In contrast to the proposed algorithm, LS-SVM behaves unstably without variable selection. It is also shown that there is no superior strategy for OP-ELM: any of three can be the best. In addition, the prediction accuracy of an ensemble of OP-ELM is studied and it is shown that averaging predictions of the ensemble can improve the accuracy (Mean Square Error) dramatically.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Time series prediction"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "ELM"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "OP-ELM"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "LS-SVM"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Recursive strategy"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Direct strategy"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "DirRec strategy"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Ordinary least squares"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608013002967", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608013002967", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84890844620", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84890844620", "pubmed-id": "24365536", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84890844620", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20131210", "$": "2013-12-10"}}}}}
