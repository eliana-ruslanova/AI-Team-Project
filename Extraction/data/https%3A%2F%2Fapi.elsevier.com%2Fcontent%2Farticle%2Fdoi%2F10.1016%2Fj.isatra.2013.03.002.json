Firstly, the traditional JITL technique is improved. The new IJITL technique has less computational burden and is more suitable for online identification of the PMSM drive system which is highly real-time compared to traditional JITL. In this way, the PMSM drive system is identified by IJITL technique, which provides information to an adaptive PI controller. Secondly, the adaptive PI controller is designed in discrete time domain which is composed of a PI controller and a supervisory controller. The PI controller is capable of automatically online tuning the control gains based on the gradient descent method and the supervisory controller is developed to eliminate the effect of the approximation error introduced by the PI controller upon the system stability in the Lyapunov sense. Finally, experimental results on the PMSM drive system show accurate identification and favorable tracking performance.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "JITL"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "PI control"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Discrete time"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "PMSM"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Adaptive"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Improved"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019057813000323", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019057813000323", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84879881819", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84879881819", "pubmed-id": "23659836", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84879881819", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20130506", "$": "2013-05-06"}}}}}
