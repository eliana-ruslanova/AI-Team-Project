Unlike other tools, neuroprosthetics create a shared space that seamlessly spans the user\u2019s internal goal representation of the world and the external physical environment enabling a much deeper human\u2013tool symbiosis. A key factor in the transformation of \u2018simple tools\u2019 into \u2018intelligent tools\u2019 is the concept of co-adaptation where the tool becomes functionally involved in the extraction and definition of the user\u2019s goals. Recent advancements in the neuroscience and engineering of neuroprosthetics are providing a blueprint for how new co-adaptive designs based on reinforcement learning change the nature of a user\u2019s ability to accomplish tasks that were not possible using conventional methodologies. By designing adaptive controls and artificial intelligence into the neural interface, tools can become active assistants in goal-directed behavior and further enhance human performance in particular for the disabled population. This paper presents recent advances in computational and neural systems supporting the development of symbiotic neuroprosthetic assistants.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Brain\u2013machine interface"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Brain\u2013computer symbiosis"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Reinforcement learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Perception\u2013action cycle"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Tool use"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608009000483", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608009000483", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "67349094505", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-67349094505", "pubmed-id": "19403263", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/67349094505", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20090405", "$": "2009-04-05"}}}}}
