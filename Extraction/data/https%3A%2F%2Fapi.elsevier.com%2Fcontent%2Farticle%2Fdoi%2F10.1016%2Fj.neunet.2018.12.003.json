A fundamental process in network-based (graph-based) data analysis techniques is the network construction from original data usually in vector form. Here, a natural question is: How to construct an \u201coptimal\u201d network regarding a given processing goal? This paper investigates structural optimization in the context of network-based data classification tasks. To be specific, we propose a particle swarm optimization framework which is responsible for building a network from vector-based data set while optimizing a quality function driven by the classification accuracy. The classification process considers both topological and physical features of the training and test data and employing PageRank measure for classification according to the importance concept of a test instance to each class. Results on artificial and real-world problems reveal that data network generated using structural optimization provides better results in general than those generated by classical network formation methods. Moreover, this investigation suggests that other kinds of network-based machine learning and data mining tasks, such as dimensionality reduction and data clustering, can benefit from the proposed structural optimization method.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Complex networks"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Machine learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Network structural optimization"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Data classification"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Graph optimization"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Particle swarm"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608018303344", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608018303344", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85059464316", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85059464316", "pubmed-id": "30616096", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85059464316", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20181214", "$": "2018-12-14"}}}}}
