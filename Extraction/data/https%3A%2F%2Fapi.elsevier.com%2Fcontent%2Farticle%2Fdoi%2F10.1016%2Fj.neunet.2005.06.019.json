Neurophysiological studies have shown the phenomenon of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). Various models were suggested to implement an STDP-like learning rule in artificial networks based on spiking neuronal representations. The rule presented here was developed under three constraints. First, it only depends on the information that is available at the synapse at the time of synaptic modification. Second, it naturally follows from neurophysiological and psychological research starting with Hebb's postulate [D. Hebb. (1949). The organization of behavior. Wiley, New York]. Third, it is simple, computationally cheap and its parameters are straightforward to determine. This rule is further extended by addition of four different types of gating derived from conventionally used types of gated decay in learning rules for continuous firing rate neural networks. The results show that the advantages of using these gatings are transferred to the new rule without sacrificing its dependency on spike-timing.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Spike-timing-dependent plasticity"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Gated decay"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Learning rules"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Spiking neural networks"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608005001048", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608005001048", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "27744590335", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-27744590335", "pubmed-id": "16095878", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/27744590335", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20050810", "$": "2005-08-10"}}}}}
