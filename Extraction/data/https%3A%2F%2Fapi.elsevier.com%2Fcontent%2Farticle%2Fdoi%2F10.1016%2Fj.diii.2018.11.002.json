Radiologie, CHU de N\u00eemes, 30029 Nimes cedex 9, France. Radiologie, CHU de N\u00eemes Nimes cedex 9 30029 France Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, deep learning, big data, and other terms pertaining to the digital realm saturate our medical publications and research fields. Radiology is not exempt from this highly publicized phenomenon. Bold statements are issued, semantic and scientific corners are cut, and unfounded declarations are made by people who are described as \u2018well informed\u2019 but have never practiced radiology and medical imaging. Pundits predict that software manufacturers or non-radiologist physicians will gain control of specialties that rely heavily on imaging, such as screening, diagnosis, and interventional radiology. In the current environment, experts are criticized ever more harshly. Populists are skilled in exploiting the cognitive biases that characterize human beings, such as trust in first impressions, a tendency to see what we want to see and to believe what we want to believe, and a propensity for surrounding ourselves with people who encourage our beliefs. Populism thrives on frustrations, notably those related to the digital revolution. Those who are sensitive to the populist narrative see experts as the arrogant and biased offspring of globalization. As pointed out by the economist Jean Tirole, a democracy devoid of experts can only end in catastrophe, as it allows free rein to any and all beliefs. The result is the annihilation of reason. Restoring the credibility of experts: \u2022 restores confidence in science (pedagogy, education, and long-term processes); \u2022 spells out the differences between theory and experience and between correlations and causality, clarifying what data are, and explaining simple scientific methods. Radiology and medical imaging is a young specialty, around for only about 100 years, that has never ceased to innovate via the development of imaging techniques (radiography, ultrasonography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, hybrid imaging) for multiple applications in nearly all fields of healthcare. Very early on the use of medical imaging translated into implications for patient management. More recently, the introduction of image digitization has led to exponential growth of available data. The images produced for many years comprised big data, either per se (e.g., analysis in MRI of diffusion tensors along multiple vectors) or due to the accumulation of data provided by an imaging study or collected in a population. Big data are already managed by radiologists for clinical applications via picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) and informatics standards. Attention should be directed to the volume as well as the heterogeneity of the imaging data produced. Heterogeneity is a major issue in radiology and medical imaging as it influences the granularity of the desired information after processing by AI software. Imaging data can be coupled to other data, such as the online request and structured radiology report, with the goal of identifying relevant issues or care pathways. Decision support is among the several applications of future personalized radiology. The advent of digitization opens up a vast horizon of possibilities that extends beyond the boundaries of our imagination. The time that will be needed to set up new organisation is often underestimated due to, in no particular order, economic, regulatory, ethical, scientific, and technological constraints. An important step, however, is defining the needs and expectations related to: \u2022 the increase in the number of images generated (i.e., today one CT examination generates 1000 to 5000 images, each CT machine performs 50 to 100 scans each day, and over 100 million imaging studies are performed each year); \u2022 the need for ensuring the reproducibility of imaging studies and developing relevant management strategies; \u2022 the development of data analysis capabilities that far exceed those of humans. The radiology profession will change; but in contrast to predictions in the media, radiology and medical imaging will continue to expand steadily, with the development of predictive, preventive, personalized, participative and accurate radiology. Radiologists must have a strong personal investment in the new possibilities emerging in our specialty, so that they can continue their long tradition of innovation and of involvement in the care pathway and personalized management of their patients. This position paper was developed by medical experts specialized in radiology and medical imaging. It is not exhaustive and will require updating over time. It puts forth definitions, describes approaches to teaching and research, develops an ethical vision, and provides clear and practical recommendations. The AI applications discussed in the position paper will become available within the next 5 years. Longer-term predictions are more challenging to make. As AI is essentially a statistical tool, its development in the field of public health should produce major advances in our knowledge of the health of populations and in the identification of risk factors for adverse health events. Radiologists specialized in public health may then have a role to play. In everyday practice, AI will be used as a co-pilot for image interpretation. Unsupervised image management by AI tools is unlikely to occur, as suggested by current AI use in aeronautics, because AI tools can make medical errors, particularly in patients with complex conditions. In addition, the role for the radiologist is not confined to image interpretation. It is far more complex, as responsibilities range from validation of the imaging study request to disclosure of the results through performance of the appropriate imaging study. Without a doubt, AI will improve our practice by better integrating the full spectrum of data available for each patient, thus allowing us to deliver accurate and personalized medicine tailored to each patient. AI will also be useful for image triaging in geographic areas where radiology resources are scant (e.g., in developing countries) to optimally select patients for referral to expert treatment centers. In conclusion, radiologists are already deeply involved in the major changes brought about by AI. Moving forward, their commitment is indispensable to develop and conduct the clinical validation of AI system training databases. Their cooperation will then be necessary to integrate AI within the radiology workflow, thus ensuring that effective tools beneficial to patient care and management become available in the near future.
