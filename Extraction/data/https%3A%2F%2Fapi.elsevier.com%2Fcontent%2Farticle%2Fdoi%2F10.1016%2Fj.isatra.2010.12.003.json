These methods are i. estimation based on kinetic model of overflow metabolism; ii. estimation based on metabolic black-box model; iii. estimation based on observer; iv. estimation based on artificial neural network; v. estimation based on differential evaluation. Biomass concentrations are estimated from available measurements and compared with experimental data obtained from large scale fermentations. The advantages and disadvantages of the presented techniques are discussed with regard to accuracy, reproducibility, number of primary measurements required and adaptation to different working conditions. Among the various techniques, the metabolic black-box method seems to have advantages although the number of measurements required is more than that for the other methods. However, the required extra measurements are based on commonly employed instruments in an industrial environment. This method is used for developing a model based control of fed-batch yeast fermentations.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "State estimation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Asymptotic observer"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial neural network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Differential evolution"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Biocalorimetry and baker\u2019s yeast"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019057810001230", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019057810001230", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "79952455843", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-79952455843", "pubmed-id": "21257167", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79952455843", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20110122", "$": "2011-01-22"}}}}}
