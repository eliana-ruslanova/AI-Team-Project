In fact, oils can provide numerous health benefits as synergic ingredient combined with other hydrophobic active ingredients. However, stable microparticles for pharmaceutical purposes are difficult to achieve when commonly techniques are used. In this work, sunflower oil was encapsulated in calcium-alginate capsules by prilling technique in co-axial configuration. Core-shell beads were produced by inverse gelation directly at the nozzle using a w/o emulsion containing aqueous calcium chloride solution in sunflower oil pumped through the inner nozzle while an aqueous alginate solution, coming out from the annular nozzle, produced the beads shell. To optimize process parameters artificial intelligence tools were proposed to optimize the numerous prilling process variables. Homogeneous and spherical microcapsules with narrow size distribution and a thin alginate shell were obtained when the parameters as w/o constituents, polymer concentrations, flow rates and frequency of vibration were optimized by two commercial software, FormRules\u00ae and INForm\u00ae, which implement neurofuzzy logic and Artificial Neural Networks together with genetic algorithms, respectively. This technique constitutes an innovative approach for hydrophobic compounds microencapsulation.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Inverse gelation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Oil microencapsulation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Prilling"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Core-shell particles"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "ANNs"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Neurofuzzy logic"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378517318300334", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378517318300334", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85041114548", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85041114548", "pubmed-id": "29341917", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85041114548", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20180116", "$": "2018-01-16"}}}}}
