Sub-optimal decision strategies \u2013 using simplified as opposed to analytic decision rules \u2013 have been reported in domains such as healthcare, military operational planning, and government policy making. We investigate the potential of a computational toolkit called \u201cIMAGE\u201d to improve decision-making by developing structural knowledge and increasing understanding of complex situations. IMAGE is tested within the context of a complex military convoy management task through (a) interactive simulations, and (b) visualization and knowledge representation capabilities. We assess the usefulness of two versions of IMAGE (desktop and immersive) compared to a baseline. Results suggest that the prosthesis helped analysts in making better decisions, but failed to increase their structural knowledge about the situation once the cognitive prosthesis is removed.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Complex decision making"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Visual analytics"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Knowledge representation"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003687016301405", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687016301405", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84982099133", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84982099133", "pubmed-id": "27633232", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84982099133", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20160805", "$": "2016-08-05"}}}}}
