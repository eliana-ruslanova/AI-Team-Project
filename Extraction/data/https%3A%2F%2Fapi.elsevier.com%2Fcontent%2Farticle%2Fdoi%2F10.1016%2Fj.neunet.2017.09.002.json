The memory can distinguish a single infection from a polyinfection. Our model is a combination of the improved versions of the original linear quantum retrieving algorithm proposed by Ventura and the non-linear quantum search algorithm of Abrams and Lloyd. From the given simulation results, it appears that the efficiency of recognition is good when particular signs and symptoms of a disease are inserted given that the linear algorithm is the main algorithm. The non-linear algorithm helps confirm or correct the diagnosis or give some advice to the medical staff for the treatment. So, our QAMDiagnos that has a friendly graphical user interface for desktop and smart-phone is a sensitive and a low-cost diagnostic tool that enables rapid and accurate diagnosis of four tropical diseases.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Quantum associative memory"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Quantum search algorithm"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Linear search algorithm"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Non-linear search algorithm"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Tropical diseases"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608017302046", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608017302046", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85030863640", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85030863640", "pubmed-id": "29031082", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85030863640", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20170921", "$": "2017-09-21"}}}}}
