We have proposed a novel Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm in which a mutation operator is added to an Artificial Bee Colony for improving its performance. When the current best solution cannot be updated, a blended crossover operator (BLX-\u03b1) of genetic algorithm is applied, in order to enhance the diversity of ABC, without compromising with the solution quality. This modified version of ABC is used as a new tool to create and optimize automatically the membership functions and rules base directly from data. We take the diabetes dataset used in our work from the UCI machine learning repository. The performances of the proposed method are evaluated through classification rate, sensitivity and specificity values using 10-fold cross-validation method. The obtained classification rate of our method is 84.21% and it is very promising when compared with the previous research in the literature for the same problem.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial Bee Colony"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Interpretable classification"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Fuzzy rules"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Diabetes disease"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169260713002447", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260713002447", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84883746011", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84883746011", "pubmed-id": "23932385", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84883746011", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20130807", "$": "2013-08-07"}}}}}
