Artifacts and collaborative work in healthcare: methodological, theoretical, and technological implications of the tangible Yan Xiao \u204e yxiao@umaryland.edu University of Maryland School of Medicine, 685 W. Baltimore St., MSTF 534, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA \u204e Correspoding author. Fax: +1 410 706 2550 Abstract Although modeled as knowledge work with emphasis on data flow and decision making, healthcare is delivered in the context of a highly structured physical environment, with much effort and emphasis placed on physical and spatial arrangement and re-arrangement of workers, patients, and materials. The tangible aspects of highly collaborative healthcare work have profound implications for research and development of information and communication technology (ICT) despite the tendency to model work as flow of abstract data items. This article reviews field studies in healthcare and other domains on the role of artifacts in collaborative work and draws implications in three areas: methodological, theoretical, and technological. In regard to methodologies, assessment of new ICT and development of user requirements should take into account how artifacts are used and exploited to facilitate collaborative work. In regard to theories, the framework of distributed cognition provides a starting point for modeling the contribution and exploitation of physical artifacts in supporting collaborative work. In regard to technology, design and deployment of new technology should support the functions provided by physical artifacts replaced or disrupted by new technology, and profitable ways for new technology to support collaborative work by embedding ICT into existing infrastructure of physical artifacts. Keywords Artifacts Computer-supported cooperative work Distributed cognition 1 Introduction During the past 20 years, the explosion of information and communication technology (ICT) has changed dramatically how we work together. ICT creates new opportunities for collaborative work and is a strong driving force in reshaping collaborative work. Increasingly, human collaborative activities are mediated by tools with computing and telecommunication capabilities. Research has been carried out to understand collaborative work in response to the need for optimal design of ICT to support it. Research results have painted a complicated picture of collaborative work, both supported and unsupported by ICT [1\u20133]. Healthcare has two characteristics that make deployment of ICT challenging as well as potentially highly beneficial. First, healthcare is a prime example of collaborative work. In hospitals, multiple people provide care to each patient and bring to bear their expertise and efforts. As pointed out by Bion and Heffner [4], care is increasingly delivered by highly specialized personnel, with frequent hand-offs. As conceptualized by Strauss et al. [5], \u201carticulation work\u201d is necessary to integrate and coordinate the contributions from individuals over the course of a patient\u2019s stay in a hospital. Second, in contrast to many industrial settings, healthcare work is often non-routine, so it is difficult to pre-schedule events and activities. Exceptions, emergencies, and other contingencies are frequent enough to be an obstacle for standardization of work processes. These two characteristics lead to dependencies on intense information processing and communication activities to achieve coordination and lend justification for wide deployment of ICT to coordinate work. However, introduction of large-scale ICT has met with resistance and failures [6,7]. Studies of large-scale ICT, such as computerized physician order entry systems, have produced insight into failure factors, such as the mismatch between actual and assumed information flows in medication processes [8]. Recently, arguments have been made to incorporate ideas from the field of computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) into health informatics [9]. CSCW has produced methodologies and conceptual frameworks for understanding healthcare work that is increasingly supported by ICT and for designing successful ICT systems. Particularly, the field of CSCW has brought into focus the importance of studying work activities in their natural context [10]. This paper reviews a body of literature that highlights the important role of physical objects in supporting collaborative work. The nuances of work including physical aspects of a work environment are often unaccounted for in quantitative studies and work process mapping. Studies of interactions with the physical environment in collaborative work can provide insights into how people work together [11]. As demonstrated by studies on ways in which physical and perceptual properties of work environments are exploited [12\u201315], much can be learned about the roles of the tangible. Insights gained in such studies can guide design of collaborative tools. For example, paper-based forms perform functions more than simply conveying information [16]. Ignoring other functions may have detrimental effects when paper forms are replaced with computerized forms [17]. Healthcare is delivered in the context of a resource-intensive, physical environment, which is often deliberately and extensively structured to facilitate collaborative work. Based on reviews of studies in mostly non-healthcare domains, we wish to draw implications of the tangible in three areas: methodological, theoretical, and technological. In particular, with more uses of ICT in healthcare, clinicians\u2019 information space is increasingly digital and virtual. Bridging the digital with the tangible may be a driving force for new technology. 2 Collaborative work supported by the tangible Office automation and the concept of \u201cpaperless office\u201d were driven by the advances of desktop computing [18], although the importance of materiality of coordinative artifacts has been recognized as more and more office work is automated [19]. In contrast to desktop computing and office work, healthcare delivery is carried out in a richer physical environment, which one can adapt, change, and share. Work objects, such as medication, supplies, laboratory samples, and patients, are physical. A growing body of literature has identified various ways in which the tangible, or physical, aspects of the workplace can support collaboration. 2.1 Artifacts as mediators of collective work To illustrate how artifacts are used to support collaborative work, we use the example by Boguslaw and Porter [20] about the \u201cspindle wheel\u201d in the short-order restaurant industry. The spindle wheel has a number of hooks on which order checks can be placed. As a simple artifact, it makes the coordination between the waitresses and the cook less effortful and more reliable: [The wheel] first of all acts as a memory for the cook; he does not have to remember orders, the wheel does it for him. The wheel also acts as a buffer drum. The input rate and output rate need no longer be one-to-one. Ten waitresses may come to the wheel almost simultaneously, but the cook takes the orders one by one. The wheel also acts as a double queuing device. Waitresses no longer need to stand in line to put in their orders; the wheel stands in line for them. Moreover, the wheel does not get the orders mixed up, but keeps them in proper queue sequence. Finally, the wheel also serves as a display of all the information in the system at a given time. The cooks, by having random access to the information, are enabled to organize their work around larger work units, such as the simultaneous preparation of three or four similar orders. The fact that the order is recorded on a check, equally available to waitress and cook to check back upon when an error has been made, permits feedback and the consequent elimination of habitual errors (p. 393). This example and the analysis by Boguslaw and Porter demonstrate how a physical artifact facilitates the articulation of divided labor and reduces the need for explicit articulation efforts. In various forms, workers in healthcare \u201cinvented\u201d a number of physical artifacts for the purpose of coordination, from a trivial example of in/out boxes to a more elaborate example of magnet whiteboards found in many if not most hospitals. A recent analysis of collaborative work in emergency response dispatch centers revealed similar beneficial efforts of the tangible, including a large computerized wall map [21]. In particular, in comparison with desktop computer systems, physical artifacts afford the economy of efforts in mediating individual activities and are thus preferable by workers. Multiple people can easily integrate their contribution through the use of physical artifacts and the shared workspace. When interacting with physical objects, one\u2019s focal attention is visible to co-workers, which is often not the case when work objects are elements on a desktop computer display. Air traffic controllers\u2019 physical paper data strips, known as \u201cflight strips,\u201d are another example of how physical objects facilitate collaboration and why computerized solutions are resisted by users in high-risk settings [22\u201324]. Flight strips are used to manage air traffic, primarily as a way to record vital information about a flight. Because flight strips are in a physical paper form, controllers can annotate them and handle them physically, such as rearranging how strips relate to each other. Flights deserving special attention are sometimes represented by misaligning certain flight strips. A number of benefits of paper flight strips were discovered [24], which were thought to contribute to the safety of managing air traffic and may explain air traffic controllers\u2019 resistance to computerized information systems. For example, the physical activities associated with handling flight strips provide visual cues to neighboring controllers. Even in control centers where computerized systems were installed, Mackay [24] found that various paper artifacts were used. She concluded that \u201cattempts to radically change work practices that have successfully evolved over the past 50 years will almost certainly fail to account for all the embedded, intangible safety factors and are likely to result in dangerous, perhaps fatal, situations\u201d (p. 337). In a study on workflow technology used in print shops [25], an important distinction was made on whether workflow technology is internal or external to work objects. In typical office work, the objects of work are often files on computers on which workflow technology resides (internal). In the print shops described by Bowers et al. [25], a litho-machine and heterogeneous computerized printing machines were not connected to workflow technology (external). Consequently, smooth flow of work was achieved through direct observations of physical work objects (e.g., noise patterns from machines and paper stocks remaining) without the benefit of workflow technology. In fact, Bowers and associates found that work flow technology disrupted smooth flow of work by imposition of inefficient procedures. In healthcare, collaborative work is usually mediated through physical objects not linked to any computer systems. For example, one person may lay out ampules of medication on a drug cart to support anticipated use by another, as during preparation for anesthesia induction. The drug cart is part of the shared workspace between the two workers. The number and types of ampules prepared are communicated by direct access to the shared workspace. No separate communication is needed. As another example, one crew (nurses) may set up an operating room for another crew (surgeons). The physical work environment (operating room) thus becomes a medium for mediating activities of different workers. 2.2 Close physical proximity and implicit communication When people work in close physical proximity, such as pilots in airplane cockpits, non-verbal communications may become vital and efficient ways of exchanging information. Segal [13] observed that pilots use direct visual access to check the status of the tasks carried out by the other pilot. His findings demonstrate the importance of information implicitly exchanged in a face-to-face setting. For example, a redesign was considered that would disrupt pilots\u2019 direct visual access to each other\u2019s activities, although explicit communication (voice) was supported. Such redesign would increase explicit communication workload and make coordination more difficult. Heath et al. [26] observed that a small group in close physical proximity made use of peripheral monitoring to maintain an awareness of others\u2019 work status. Such monitoring could, for example, allow one to detect the \u201cboundary\u201d of others\u2019 activities so that necessary interruptions could be made with the least detrimental effects. Coordination was simplified due to the fact that everyone in the group was aware of each other\u2019s activities. Bellotti and Bly [27] found that the members on a design team took advantage of being co-located by walking to colleagues\u2019 workstations. They concluded that co-presence and mutual awareness provided opportunity for implicit communication, whereas current technology tends to support only explicit communication. 2.3 Public displays An important class of mediating artifacts is respresented by the public display boards found in many workplaces. These boards are used to represent task, material, personnel, and scheduling and status information. Public displays provide awareness information about staff, patients, and resources in a hospital environment. Fig. 1 is an example of a \u201cgrease\u201d board on which information about new patient admissions to a trauma center is written after receiving calls from prehospital care providers. Historically, the board was an economical way of broadcasting time-sensitive information, but people must come to the board to see the information. Some public display boards have been replaced by individual computer terminals. Presumably the goal of communicating to a large audience is now achieved through individual access. Studies of public display boards have demonstrated the importance of shared access in collaborative work. For example, in emergency resource centers, several types of public displays are used to indicate status information and facilitate discussions (e.g., a flip chart) among many people [28]. Similarly, in a news editorial office [29], web pages are printed out and placed on a large wall surface to facilitate collaborative efforts in reviewing and editing web page content. In a train control rooms, the wall display of train track status not only supports individual controllers\u2019 information needs but also enables the controllers to refer to and discuss the information [30]. In evaluating a computerized patient scheduling system, Bardram [17] found that users maintained a whiteboard to re-represent the information in the computer system so that it was publicly shared and manipulated. Public displays, as opposed to private displays, support synchronous communication among collaborating workers in face-to-face settings. Previously cited studies in emergency resource centers [28], editorial offices [29], and train control rooms [30] all demonstrated the role of public displays in supporting group discussions. Other roles of public displays have been noted in previous studies. When public displays can store information for later access, one can essentially communicate across time [31], although shared use of such asynchronous capabilities has not been emphasized. Getting everyone \u201con the same page\u201d is another role of public displays. Bellotti and Rogers [29], for example, noticed that the public display of assignments provides a way for individuals or teams to visualize current team activities and resource availability, so that everyone knows what everyone else knows about resource status. In our own research, the use of a large \u201ccommunal\u201d display (the magnetic whiteboard shown in Fig. 2 ) in managing a six-room trauma operating suite was studied [32]. The display is located in a convenient gathering point, yet access is restricted to staff. The public nature of the board encourages communal management of activities in the operating rooms, with workers voluntarily updating the whiteboard with information to which they have easy or special access, such as staffing schedules or surgery progress [33]. Negotiations and joint assessment of situations are supported by manipulating and referencing objects on the whiteboard. 2.4 Customization and tailoring of the work environment Physical objects often afford flexible configuration and tailoring, perhaps due to the ease with which physical objects can be rearranged and new objects introduced. In the study described earlier on a whiteboard used in operating room management [32], staff members on a continual basis adapt and invent uses of physical objects placed on the whiteboard. They also exploit different arrangements of objects to convey changes in status (often subtle) in response to the changing environment, such as staffing shortages or patient volume increases. A field study at a Stockholm underground control room [34] uncovered how the same technological artifacts are being used by operators in different ways during day- and night-shift operations. A comparison between the shifts revealed that the available computer support systems were not flexible enough to capture the different operational needs. Idiosyncratic customizations, undertaken by the operators, and their adaptations of the provided systems made it possible to organize work in such a way as to properly address the dynamic nature of tasks. The amount of effort devoted to customization and tailoring workplaces is best represented by surgical operations, where an extensive amount of preparatory work is carried out. Hazelhurst et al. [35], through an ethnographic study, examined how the physical layout of instruments and tools as well as nurses\u2019 \u201ccheat sheets\u201d and other memory aids are used as cognitive artifacts. They discovered that the interaction with the tangible was maintained through formal and informal practices. Through these practices, the customization and tailoring work was carried out to dynamically achieve a balance between planning as preparation to follow a specified path to an intended outcome and planning as preparation for unanticipated circumstances and events. In surgery, it is essential to have the right tools for the job in the right place at the right time, in order to achieve desired outcomes, even in the face of unforeseen circumstances and events. Reorganizing work and tailoring work environments are often needed in healthcare owing to the variability of patient conditions and the demand for autonomy by care providers. The studies reviewed here indicate a preference by workers for tangible objects in complex, dynamic environments, perhaps because of a perceived ease in working with physical objects and of a perceived simplicity of physical objects. 3 Methodological and theoretical implications ICT, because of its roots in computation and desktop document processing, has contributed to the tendency to model work processes in terms of abstract data elements. Along with the flow of the tangible in work processes is the flow of information, which relies increasingly on ICT as opposed to paper. Healthcare workers are interacting more frequently with virtual objects in the digital world. However, the tangible nature of health care delivery creates a challenge in bridging the gap between the tangible and the virtual. Based on the studies reviewed here, I will first draw implications in methodologies and theories in understanding the challenge. In the subsequent section, I will draw implications related to technological development in meeting the challenge. Ethnographic methodologies have been used in the field of CSCW to reveal how work is actually carried out, through a combination of direct observation, interviews, and detailed analysis of audiovideo records. In the case of healthcare work, much can be learned about the mediating functions of physical artifacts in articulating individual activities. Ethnographic studies often uncover flexible, multiple methods or processes used in response to contingencies and contextual factors [12,25]. In particular, the division of labor is often flexible, as work organization could be made easily, in part mediated by the physical environment. For example, the study of a print shop showed that line-of-sight access to other workers and the noise from machines allow workers to help each other [25]. The grounded theory approach [36] is a qualitative research methodology that emphasizes the iterative nature of discovery, especially in the study of complex human activities with rich social context. The essence of the grounded theory approach is generative as opposed to confirmative. Because of this nature, it is applicable to studies of phenomena that are not yet well defined. The grounded theory approach, as outlined by Strauss and Corbin [36], provides procedural guidance to qualitative analytic methodologies. The procedure is driven by general research questions as opposed to specific well-defined questions. Several theoretical frameworks are relevant in understanding the key roles of the physical aspects of a workplace. One framework is distributed cognition, and the other is display-based cognition. The term \u201cdistributed cognition\u201d is used to describe the nature of problem solving when information processing is distributed in the environment (external representation) and in the problem solver\u2019s head (internal representation). Distributed cognition emphasizes the integral role of external representations and the collaborative nature in human cognition [37,38]. This approach stresses the importance of including representational artifacts in the study of human behavior. Onboard a naval vessel, Hutchins [12] observed that artifacts such as maps, rulers, and pointers functioned as external reference pointers for intra-crew communications and as markers of intermediate knowledge. The collaborative nature in healthcare provides a strong incentive to study in detail how work is organized across different workers through the use of artifacts. Instead of viewing information processing as activities carried out only inside one\u2019s head, we should examine how information processing occurs in a system of workers and their work environment, including representation and manipulation afforded by the physical characteristics of the work environment. ICT can be considered as components of the system, as opposed to a separate system. Workers will tailor ICT so that it fits into the work environment. For example, schedules stored by ICT are frequently printed so they can be posted where access is needed, such as near telephones. As another example, clinicians often use printed lists of patients under their care to write notes and reminders. Such activities represent methods of bridging the digital world and the physical worlds. The distributed cognition framework provides a guide for us to examine the cognitive contribution of physical objects. A related approach in modelling the contribution of the tangible to human cognitive activities is display-based cognition. Larkin [39] commented that \u201cproblem solving is often done in the context of an external display. Often there are the physical objects that are part of a problem situation. Alternatively the solver may construct equations and diagrams as an aid to solving the problem\u201d (p. 319). By having external representation, humans can solve problems by leveraging perceptual capabilities. Larkin noted several features of such \u201cdisplay-based\u201d problem solving: (1) the process is easy, (2) it is largely error free, (3) it is not degraded by interruption, (4) the steps are performed in a variety of orders, and (5) the process is easily modified. The contribution of external representation was verified in an experimental effort [37]. Zhang and Norman [37] summarized how external representation helps problem solving: (1) external representations can provide memory aids and (2) external representations can provide directly perceivable information (such as constraints and options). One could argue that the contribution of the tangible to collaborative work is more significant than that to individual work. The importance of being aware of activities of others in a collaborative environment is easily understood, yet how such awareness is achieved is not [9,40]. As healthcare becomes more fragmented, resulting in more hand-offs, achieving awareness is even more critical for patient safety and efficiency. The tangible aspects of a workplace are exploited by workers to achieve awareness, as shown in the previous selected review of studies. In our own work, the concept of joint display-based cognition was proposed to denote how the physical aspects of a workplace serve as an integral part of cognitive functions, keeping co-workers informed of events, activities, and status [32]. 4 Technological implications Recent advances in ICT have the potential to blur the boundary between the tangible and the digital information world [41]. The integration of networked devices with physical workplaces has provided new exciting directions for supporting collaborative work in healthcare [42]. For example, widely used whiteboards may be driven, in part, by networked computers, as in the case of the eWhiteboard for coordinating activities in a cardiac catheterization laboratory [43]. With ICT, information on a whiteboard can be captured and then displayed at a remote location [44]. Networked information can be embedded onto physical surfaces, such as through projecting computer images [45]. Sensor technology such as radio frequency identification (RFID) has the potential to connect the tangible to the digital. These exciting developments bode especially well for healthcare in terms of leveraging the advantages of ICT. Collaborative work is usually mediated by physical objects, and failures of ICT are not well tolerated. In the air traffic control domain reviewed above, experimental systems were developed to take advantage of paper flight strips. One system used closed circuit television with cameras aimed at flight strips to provide distributed access to them [22]. Through the system, air traffic controllers can maintain an awareness of neighboring traffic regions by peripherally monitoring the strips of other controllers, even when they are not side by side. Another system was based on the concept of \u201caugmented reality\u201d [46] and on the assumption that computing technology does not exclude the use of paper-based artifacts. Physical flight strips were connected with computer data through sensors and projected images. Described as the next generation of user interfaces, tangible interaction [47\u201349] promises another way to bridge the gap between the physical and the digital worlds. A large and growing body of research has focused on physical-world modalities of interaction, largely built upon research themes related to ubiquitous computing, augmented reality, mixed reality, and wearable computing. The technical capabilities of using physical artifacts as representations and controls for digital information have been demonstrated repeatedly in the development of tangible user interfaces [49]. 5 Conclusions Healthcare delivery is full of examples of the articulation of individual activities. This articulation is often mediated by the physical environment containing work objects such that work flow is smooth and explicit coordination efforts are minimal. The physical environment also mediates information flow to maintain awareness of other people\u2019s activities and general status of the workplace. Desktop computing provide a starting point for CSCW, but recent advances in ICT have made it possible to embed advanced ICT into the workplace. To harness the potential of ICT in supporting collaborative work in healthcare, and to guide development of CSCW systems, we should direct our attention to the tangible in modeling, designing, and supporting workflow. In terms of methodologies, detailed studies using ethnographic methods should be carried out to understand how cognitive artifacts are used for safety and efficiency of healthcare delivery and to appreciate difficulties in incorporating large ICT systems that fundamentally change collaborative work. In terms of theories, distributed cognition approaches can be used to understand the contribution of the tangible to individual and collective performance. In terms of technology, efforts toward hybrid user interfaces and embedding information (both access and input) within physical work objects can further leverage ICT in healthcare.

The tangible aspects of highly collaborative healthcare work have profound implications for research and development of information and communication technology (ICT) despite the tendency to model work as flow of abstract data items. This article reviews field studies in healthcare and other domains on the role of artifacts in collaborative work and draws implications in three areas: methodological, theoretical, and technological. In regard to methodologies, assessment of new ICT and development of user requirements should take into account how artifacts are used and exploited to facilitate collaborative work. In regard to theories, the framework of distributed cognition provides a starting point for modeling the contribution and exploitation of physical artifacts in supporting collaborative work. In regard to technology, design and deployment of new technology should support the functions provided by physical artifacts replaced or disrupted by new technology, and profitable ways for new technology to support collaborative work by embedding ICT into existing infrastructure of physical artifacts.", "openArchiveArticle": "true", "prism:coverDate": "2005-02-28", "openaccessUserLicense": "http://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/", "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1532046404001583", "dc:creator": {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Xiao, Yan"}, "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1532046404001583"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046404001583"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": "Full", "pii": "S1532-0464(04)00158-3", "prism:volume": "38", "prism:publisher": "Elsevier Inc.", "dc:title": "Artifacts and collaborative work in healthcare: methodological, theoretical, and technological implications of the tangible", "prism:copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 2004 Elsevier Inc.
