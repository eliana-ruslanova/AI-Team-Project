Here, we revisited the approach applied by others, where a cellular automaton is designed to simulate the behavior of a ligand molecule traveling toward the active site of an enzyme. Since a cellular automaton plane is topologically equivalent to a torus surface, we recommended the use of a \u2018double cellular automata\u2019 to model globular proteins. With the boundary conditions applied, our model is topologically identical to a sphere. It was shown that using this model, even fewer steps are needed for a molecule to attend the active site. This assumption can lead to more realistic results in the modeling of surfaces with spherical topology.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Cellular automata"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Protein surface"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Perfect enzyme"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "von Neumann neighborhood"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Moor neighborhood"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X05008855", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X05008855", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "20444457498", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-20444457498", "pubmed-id": "15958207", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/20444457498", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20050428", "$": "2005-04-28"}}}}}
