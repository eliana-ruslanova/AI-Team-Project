Thirty-one factors determining the impact of an accident on a particular stretch of road were identified and subdivided into two major groups: accident probability factors and accident severity factors. Given the number of factors determining the state of a particular road segment, the only viable statistical methods for implementing the model were machine learning techniques, such as multilayer perceptron networks (MLPs), classification trees (CARTs) and support vector machines (SVMs). The results produced by these techniques on a test sample were more favourable than those produced by traditional discriminant analysis, irrespective of whether dimensionality reduction techniques were applied. The best results were obtained using SVMs specifically adapted to ordinal data. This technique takes advantage of the ordinal information contained in the data without penalising the computational load. Furthermore, the technique permits the estimation of the utility function that is latent in expert knowledge.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Pollutant substances"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Ordinal data"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Machine learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Support vector machines"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Transportation"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304389406015196", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389406015196", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "34447630788", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-34447630788", "pubmed-id": "17254706", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34447630788", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20061221", "$": "2006-12-21"}}}}}
