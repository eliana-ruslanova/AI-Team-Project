The need is to study the research carried out in this technology and identify its different applications in the medical field.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  Studies and research articles on \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d and \u201cartificial intelligence in the medical field\u201d have identified significant applications of AI. This article explores and shows how AI helps to solve challenging problems in the medical field through extensive research and development.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  The study identified five significant technologies as being used in AI in the medical field and the process of implementing AI. Finally, this article identifies ten primary applications of AI in the medical field, along with a brief description. AI provides a productive clinical decision to improve patient outcomes.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  Different technologies are adopted and experimented with increasing automation in the medical field. Nowadays, AI is being introduced in the medical field to keep a medical record in digital format and conduct patient checkup using smart technologies. It provides solutions, especially in targeted treatments, uniquely composed drugs and personalised therapies. AI is an innovative technology that helps to guide the surgeon during medication, treatment and operation. The main application of this technology is for better decision-making for complicated cases. It can also help to track, detect, investigate and control the infection in the hospital. This technology develops and optimises online patient appointment platforms. In future, it will be helpful in all medical areas to serve humanity.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial intelligence (AI)"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "AI application"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "AI technologies"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Medical"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Treatment"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Decision-making"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S235208171930193X", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235208171930193X", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20191112", "$": "2019-11-12"}}}}}
