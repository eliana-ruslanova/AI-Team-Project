The primary aim of this review is to showcase the current and emerging diagnostic techniques that are used in lung cancer detection. Lung cancer is a leading cause of death among smokers and it has been emerging in non-smokers due to passive smoke inhalation by non-smokers. The mortality rate of patients with lung cancer is very high due to the change in lifestyle and environmental factors. It is often misdiagnosed as tuberculosis in India as tuberculosis is prevalent in India. On the contrary tuberculosis is not prevalent in the western countries Like U.S.A., U.K., Canada, etc. The major setback in lung cancer is that the symptoms of lung cancer occur at very later stages when the tumor has spread profusely. Hence, highly advanced techniques are employed for detection, accurate staging and treatment of lung cancer. The review focuses on the various novel and emerging diagnostic tools like biomarkers and biosensors, radiogenomics and artificial intelligence. This review also gives an insight of the various conventional techniques like CT-imaging, sputum cytology, biopsy and bronchoscopy which have been modified over the years for better sensitivity and accuracy. It also encompasses the regulatory provisions like IDE, CLIA-certification, etc. for manufacturing and sale of diagnostics in India, U.S.A., Japan and Australia.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Biosensors"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Quantum dots"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial inte"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Lligence"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Biomarkers"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Nanorobots"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0753332218329135", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332218329135", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85050532141", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85050532141", "pubmed-id": "30119234", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85050532141", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20180728", "$": "2018-07-28"}}}}}
