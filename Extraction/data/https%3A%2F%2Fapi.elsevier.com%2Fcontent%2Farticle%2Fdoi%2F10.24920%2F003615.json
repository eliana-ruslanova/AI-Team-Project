In this article, we review the recent progress of AI-enabled medical imaging. Firstly, we briefly review the background about AI in its way of evolution. Then, we discuss the recent successes of AI in different medical imaging tasks, especially in image segmentation, registration, detection and recognition. Also, we illustrate several representative applications of AI-enabled medical imaging to show its advantage in real scenario, which includes lung nodule in chest CT, neuroimaging, mammography, and etc. Finally, we report the way of human-machine interaction. We believe that, in the future, AI will not only change the traditional way of medical imaging, but also improve the clinical routines of medical care and enable many aspects of the medical society.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "medical imaging"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "artificial intelligence"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "deep learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "image segmentation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "image registration"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "image detection"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "image recognition"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1001929419300276", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1001929419300276", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85068875720", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85068875720", "pubmed-id": "31315746", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85068875720", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20190715", "$": "2019-07-15"}}}}}
