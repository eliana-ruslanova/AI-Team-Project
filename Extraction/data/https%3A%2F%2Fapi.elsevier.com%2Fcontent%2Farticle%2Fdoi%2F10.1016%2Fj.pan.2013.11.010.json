Databases, data mining and machine learning algorithms (MLAs), including artificial neural networks (ANNs), may assist by storing and interpreting data from multiple sources, potentially improving clinical decision-making.\n               \n               \n                  Aims\n                  1) Identify database technologies used to store AP data, 2) collate and categorise variables stored in AP databases, 3) identify the MLA technologies, including ANNs, used to analyse AP data, and 4) identify clinical and non-clinical benefits and obstacles in establishing a national or international AP database.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  Comprehensive systematic search of online reference databases. The predetermined inclusion criteria were all papers discussing 1) databases, 2) data mining or 3) MLAs, pertaining to AP, independently assessed by two reviewers with conflicts resolved by a third author.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  Forty-three papers were included. Three data mining technologies and five ANN methodologies were reported in the literature. There were 187 collected variables identified. ANNs increase accuracy of severity prediction, one study showed ANNs had a sensitivity of 0.89 and specificity of 0.96 six hours after admission \u2013 compare APACHE II (cutoff score \u22658) with 0.80 and 0.85 respectively. Problems with databases were incomplete data, lack of clinical data, diagnostic reliability and missing clinical data.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion\n                  This is the first systematic review examining the use of databases, MLAs and ANNs in the management of AP. The clinical benefits these technologies have over current systems and other advantages to adopting them are identified.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Acute pancreatitis"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial neural networks"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Database management systems"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Medical informatics"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Machine learning algorithms"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1424390313008454", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1424390313008454", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84900436641", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84900436641", "pubmed-id": "24555973", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84900436641", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20131204", "$": "2013-12-04"}}}}}
