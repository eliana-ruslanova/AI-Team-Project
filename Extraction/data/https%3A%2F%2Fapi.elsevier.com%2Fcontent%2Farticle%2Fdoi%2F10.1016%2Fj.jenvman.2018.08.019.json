BDF prescribes rates and weights for 7 data layers but FCF is an unsupervised learning framework based on a multicriteria decision theory by integrating fuzzy membership function and catastrophe theory. The challenges in the paper include: (i) the study area comprises confined and unconfined aquifers and (ii) Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used to run Multiple Framework (AIMF) in order to map specific vulnerability due to a specific contaminant. Predicted results by AIMF are referred to as Specific Vulnerability Indices, as the learned VIs are referenced to site-specific nitrate-N. The results show that correlation coefficient between BDF or FCF with nitrate-N is lower than 0.7 but the AIMF strategy improves it to greater than 0.95. The results are evidence for the proof-of-concept for transforming frameworks to models capable of further learning.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Groundwater vulnerability"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "DRASTIC"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Fuzzy-catastrophe-DRASTIC"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Support vector machine"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "AI driving multi frameworks (AIMF)"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0301479718308909", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479718308909", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85053462918", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85053462918", "pubmed-id": "30218838", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85053462918", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20180813", "$": "2018-08-13"}}}}}
