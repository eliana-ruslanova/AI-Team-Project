This paper presents an information-theoretic approach to identification of statistical patterns in such systems, where the main objective is to enhance structural integrity and operation reliability. The core concept of pattern identification is built upon the principles of Symbolic Dynamics, Automata Theory, and Information Theory. To this end, a symbolic time series analysis method has been formulated and experimentally validated on a special-purpose test apparatus that is designed for data acquisition and real-time analysis of fatigue damage in polycrystalline alloys.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Fault/analysis"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Forcasting"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Goodness monitoring"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019057807602262", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019057807602262", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "33750545570", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-33750545570", "pubmed-id": "17063932", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33750545570", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20070306", "$": "2007-03-06"}}}}}
