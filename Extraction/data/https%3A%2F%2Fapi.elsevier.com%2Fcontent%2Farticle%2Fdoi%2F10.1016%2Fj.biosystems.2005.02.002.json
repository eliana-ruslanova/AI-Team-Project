The canonical genetic code is known to be highly efficient in minimizing the effects of mistranslational errors and point mutations, an ability, which in term is designated \u201cload minimization\u201d. Prior studies have included many attempts at quantitative estimation of the fraction of randomly generated codes, which in terms of load minimization, score higher than the canonical genetic code.\n                  In this study, a neural network, which estimates a highly optimized genetic code in a relatively short period of time has been devised. Several fitness functions were used throughout this text. Meanwhile, we have made use of two cost measure matrices, PAM74\u2013100 and mutation matrix.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Boltzmann machine"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Genetic code"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Evolution"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Load minimization"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Optimality"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Neural network"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0303264705000080", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303264705000080", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "22044450680", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-22044450680", "pubmed-id": "15936137", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/22044450680", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20050603", "$": "2005-06-03"}}}}}
