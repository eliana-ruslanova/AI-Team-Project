The generated hierarchical fuzzy rule structure is composed by linguistic; multiple consequent fuzzy rules that considerably affect the model comprehensibility.\n               \n               \n                  Results and conclusion\n                  The performance of the proposed method is tested on three medical pattern classification problems and the obtained results are compared against other existing methods. It is shown that the proposed variable input partitioning leads to a flexible decision making framework and fairly accurate results with a small number of rules and a simple, fast and robust training process.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Fuzzy rule extraction from data"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hierarchical and flexible input partitioning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Interpretable and scalable knowledge"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Medical diagnosis"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0933365709000815", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365709000815", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "68249108418", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-68249108418", "pubmed-id": "19540096", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/68249108418", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20090618", "$": "2009-06-18"}}}}}
