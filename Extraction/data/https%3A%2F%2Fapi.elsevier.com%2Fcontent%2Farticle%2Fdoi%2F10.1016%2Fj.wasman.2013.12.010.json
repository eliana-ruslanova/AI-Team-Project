Compost samples representative of five different compost facilities were scanned by DRS, and the raw reflectance spectra were preprocessed using seven spectral transformations for predicting compost FDA-HR with six multivariate algorithms. Although principal component analysis for all spectral pretreatments satisfactorily identified the clusters by compost types, it could not separate different FDA contents. Furthermore, the artificial neural network multilayer perceptron (residual prediction deviation=3.2, validation r\n                     2\n                     =0.91 and RMSE=13.38\u03bcgg\u22121\n                     h\u22121) outperformed other multivariate models to capture the highly non-linear relationships between compost enzymatic activity and VisNIR reflectance spectra after Savitzky\u2013Golay first derivative pretreatment. This work demonstrates the efficiency of VisNIR DRS for predicting compost enzymatic as well as microbial activity.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Compost"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial neural network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Savitzky\u2013Golay"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Visible near infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956053X13005771", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X13005771", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84893799984", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84893799984", "pubmed-id": "24398221", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84893799984", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20140104", "$": "2014-01-04"}}}}}
