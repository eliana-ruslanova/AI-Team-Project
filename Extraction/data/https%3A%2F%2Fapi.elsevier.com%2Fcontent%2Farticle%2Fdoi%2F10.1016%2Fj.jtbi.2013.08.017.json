In this work, we showed that Local Ternary Patterns (LTPs) effectively exploit small variations in pixel intensities; present in fluorescence microscopy based protein images of human and hamster cell lines. Further, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique is applied to balance the feature space for the classification stage. We observed that LTPs coupled with data balancing technique could enable a classifier, in this case support vector machine, to yield good performance. The proposed ensemble based prediction system, using 10-fold cross-validation, has yielded better performance compared to existing techniques in predicting various subcellular compartments for both 2D HeLa and CHO datasets.
