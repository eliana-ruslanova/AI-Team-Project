They are also interdisciplinarians, performing not only medical tasks but also any form of work related to all fields of biology. Furthermore, these doctors also carry out any required research that pertains to the biological sciences. It is perhaps this unique blend of skills, combined with a fundamental orientation towards humanism and compassion, that leads to their default position, de facto, if not de jure, as the crew's ethics officers, a role that they embrace with as much dedication and zeal as the former Soviet communist political officers/commissars (the Zampolit) did theirs. This paper will show that from the very inception of Star Trek, doctors strictly adhered to deontological tenets which lead them to actively influence command decisions that pertain not only to health, but also to any ethical decisions that may have to be taken by Starfleet officers. This portrayal of future doctors signals the wishes of contemporary audiences: that future doctors remain humane, compassionate and ethical guardian angels, and not only superb medics.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378378218303104", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378378218303104", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85046682693", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85046682693", "pubmed-id": "29753536", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85046682693", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20180510", "$": "2018-05-10"}}}}}
