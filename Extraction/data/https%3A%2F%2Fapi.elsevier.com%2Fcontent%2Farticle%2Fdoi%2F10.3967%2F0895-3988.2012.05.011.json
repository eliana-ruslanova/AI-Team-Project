A hybrid particle swarm optimization/ant colony optimization (PSO/ACO) algorithm was used to quantify the probability of NTDs occurring at villages with no births. The hybrid PSO/ACO algorithm is a form of artificial intelligence adapted for hierarchical classification. It is a powerful technique for modeling complex problems involving impacts of causes.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  The algorithm was easy to apply, with the accuracy of the results being 69.5%\u00b17.02% at the 95% confidence level.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion\n                  The proposed method is simple to apply, has acceptable fault tolerance, and greatly enhances the accuracy of calculations.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Neural tube birth defects"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "GIS"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "PSO/ACO algorithm"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hierarchical classification"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Risk map"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0895398812600944", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895398812600944", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84869026461", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84869026461", "pubmed-id": "23122315", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84869026461", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20121030", "$": "2012-10-30"}}}}}
