This aim of this study was to propose a new machine learning methodology for analyzing and predicting spatial patterns of forest fire danger with a case study of tropical forest fire at Lao Cai province (Vietnam). For this purpose, a Geographical Information System (GIS) database for the study area was established, including ten influencing factors (slope, aspect, elevation, land use, distance to road, normalized difference vegetation index, rainfall, temperature, wind speed, and humidity) and 257 fire locations. The relevance level of these factors with the forest fire was analyzed and assessed using the Mutual Information algorithm. Then, a new hybrid artificial intelligence model named as MARS-DFP, which was Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) optimized by Differential Flower Pollination (DFP), was proposed and used construct forest fire model for generating spatial patterns of forest fire. MARS is employed to build the forest fire model for generalizing a classification boundary that distinguishes fire and non-fire areas, whereas DFP, a metaheuristic approach, was utilized to optimize the model. Finally, global prediction performance of the model was assessed using Area Under the curve (AUC), Classification Accuracy Rate (CAR), Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and various statistical indices. The result demonstrated that the predictive performance of the MARS-DFP model was high (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.91 and CAR\u202f=\u202f86.57%) and better to those of other benchmark methods, Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network, Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system, Radial Basis Function Neural Network. This fact confirms that the newly constructed MARS-DFP model is a promising alternative for spatial prediction of forest fire susceptibility.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Forest fire susceptibility"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "GIS"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Multivariate adaptive regression splines"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Differential Flower Pollination"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hybrid computational intelligence"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0301479719301239", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479719301239", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85062280538", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85062280538", "pubmed-id": "30825780", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85062280538", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20190227", "$": "2019-02-27"}}}}}
