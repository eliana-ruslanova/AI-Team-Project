Neuromorphic computing is an emerging solution which makes use of silicon technology in a different way, inline with the computational principles observed in animal nervous systems. In this article, we argue that the nervous systems of insects in particular offer themselves as an ideal starting point for incorporation into realistic neuromorphic systems and review research in developing insect-inspired neuromorphic systems. We conclude with an exciting yet tangible vision of a full neuromorphic sensory-motor system where a liquid state machine modelling the function of the insect mushroom body links input to output and allows for amalgamation of the work discussed in a hierarchical framework of a full system inspired by the concept of how information flows through insects.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214574518300981", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214574518300981", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85054296674", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85054296674", "pubmed-id": "30553486", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054296674", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20180921", "$": "2018-09-21"}}}}}
