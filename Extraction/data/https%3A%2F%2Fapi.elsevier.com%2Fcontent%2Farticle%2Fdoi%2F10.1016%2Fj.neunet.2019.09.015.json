His productivity, creativity, and vision would each be enough to mark a scientist of the first caliber. In combination, they have resulted in contributions that have changed the entire discipline of neural networks. Grossberg has been tremendously influential in engineering, dynamical systems, and artificial intelligence as well. Indeed, he has been one of the most important mentors and role models in my career, and has done so with extraordinary generosity and encouragement. All authors in this special issue have taken great pleasure in hereby commemorating his extraordinary career and contributions.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S089360801930276X", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089360801930276X", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85072769945", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85072769945", "pubmed-id": "31587821", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85072769945", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20190916", "$": "2019-09-16"}}}}}
