We present a method able of accurately reproducing such interactions for seven van der Waals complexes. It uses atomic multipole moments up to hexadecupole moment mapped to the positions of the nuclear coordinates by the machine learning method kriging. Models were built at three levels of theory: HF/6-31G**, B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ and M06-2X/aug-cc-pVDZ. The quality of the kriging models was measured by their ability to predict the electrostatic interaction energy between atoms in external test examples for which the true energies are known. At all levels of theory, >90% of test cases for small van der Waals complexes were predicted within 1kJmol\u22121, decreasing to 60\u201370% of test cases for larger base pair complexes. Models built on moments obtained at B3LYP and M06-2X level generally outperformed those at HF level. For all systems the individual interactions were predicted with a mean unsigned error of less than 1kJmol\u22121.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Multipole moments"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hydrogen bonding"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Force fields"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "QTAIM"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "QCT"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Kriging"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S138614251301216X", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138614251301216X", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84911483940", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84911483940", "pubmed-id": "24274986", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84911483940", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20131105", "$": "2013-11-05"}}}}}
