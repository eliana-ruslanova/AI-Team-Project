We evaluate and compare the feature extraction techniques based on Fourier transform, linear predictive coding, wavelet transform and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) in combination with the classification methods based on vector quantization, Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and artificial neural networks, using receiver operating characteristic curves. We propose the use of an optimized threshold to discriminate the wheezing class from the normal one. Also, post-processing filter is employed to considerably improve the classification accuracy. Experimental results show that our approach based on MFCC coefficients combined to GMM is well adapted to classify respiratory sounds in normal and wheeze classes.
