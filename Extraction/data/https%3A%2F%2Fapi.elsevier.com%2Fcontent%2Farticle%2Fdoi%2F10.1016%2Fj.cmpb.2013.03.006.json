Changing extrinsic factors like temperature, pressure or humidity, as well as intrinsic factors like the battery status, demand to calibrate the measurements permanently. Thus, there is a need for fast calibration algorithms, e.g. for online analyses. The primary aim of this paper is to propose a non-iterative calibration algorithm for accelerometers with the focus on minimal execution time and low memory consumption. The secondary aim is to benchmark existing calibration algorithms based on 3D-ellipsoid fitting methods. We compared the algorithms regarding the calibration quality and the execution time as well as the number of quasi-static measurements needed for a stable calibration. As evaluation criterion for the calibration, both the norm of calibrated real-life measurements during inactivity and simulation data was used. The algorithms showed a high calibration quality, but the execution time differed significantly. The calibration method proposed in this paper showed the shortest execution time and a very good performance regarding the number of measurements needed to produce stable results. Furthermore, this algorithm was successfully implemented on a sensor node and calibrates the measured data on-the-fly while continuously storing the measured data to a microSD-card.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Calibration"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Non-iterative"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Accelerometer"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Ellipsoid fitting"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169260713000825", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260713000825", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84878490698", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84878490698", "pubmed-id": "23566707", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84878490698", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20130406", "$": "2013-04-06"}}}}}
