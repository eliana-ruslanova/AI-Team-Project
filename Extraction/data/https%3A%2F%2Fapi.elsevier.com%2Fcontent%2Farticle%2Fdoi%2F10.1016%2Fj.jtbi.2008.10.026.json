These experimental methods are both time-consuming and costly. With the explosion of protein sequences registered in the databanks, it is highly desirable to develop an automated method to identify whether a given new sequence belongs to enzyme or non-enzyme. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and support vector machine (SVM) have been used in this study for distinguishing enzyme structures from non-enzymes. The networks have been trained and tested on two datasets of proteins with different wavelet basis functions, decomposition scales and hydrophobicity data types. Maximum accuracy has been obtained using SVM with a wavelet function of Bior2.4, a decomposition scale j=5, and Kyte\u2013Doolittle hydrophobicity scales. The results obtained by the self-consistency test, jackknife test and independent dataset test are encouraging, which indicates that the proposed method can be employed as a useful assistant technique for distinguishing enzymes from non-enzymes.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Bioinformatics"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Enzyme structure"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Wavelet"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Support vector machine"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Amino acid hydrophobicity"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519308005584", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519308005584", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "58549106957", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-58549106957", "pubmed-id": "19049810", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/58549106957", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20081108", "$": "2008-11-08"}}}}}
