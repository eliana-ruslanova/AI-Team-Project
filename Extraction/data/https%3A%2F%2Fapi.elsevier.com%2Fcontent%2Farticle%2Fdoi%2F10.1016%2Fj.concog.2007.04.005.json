A clear overview of this diverse field is achieved by breaking machine consciousness down into four different areas, which are used to understand its aims, discuss its relationship with other subjects and outline the work that has been carried out so far. The criticisms that have been made against machine consciousness are also covered, along with its potential benefits, and the work that has been done on analysing systems for signs of consciousness. Some of the social and ethical issues raised by machine consciousness are examined at the end of the paper.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Machine consciousness"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial consciousness"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial intelligence"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Models of consciousness"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Synthetic phenomenology"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1053810007000347", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810007000347", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "47149097511", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-47149097511", "pubmed-id": "17572107", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/47149097511", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20070614", "$": "2007-06-14"}}}}}
