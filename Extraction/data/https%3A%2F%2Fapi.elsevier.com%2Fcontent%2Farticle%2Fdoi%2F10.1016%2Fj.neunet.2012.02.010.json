We made available large datasets from various application domains: handwriting recognition, image recognition, video processing, text processing, and ecology. The goal was to learn data representations that capture regularities of an input space for re-use across tasks. The representations were evaluated on supervised learning \u201ctarget tasks\u201d unknown to the participants. The first phase of the challenge was dedicated to \u201cunsupervised transfer learning\u201d (the competitors were given only unlabeled data). The second phase was dedicated to \u201ccross-task transfer learning\u201d (the competitors were provided with a limited amount of labeled data from \u201csource tasks\u201d, distinct from the \u201ctarget tasks\u201d). The analysis indicates that learned data representations yield significantly better results than those obtained with original data or data preprocessed with standard normalizations and functional transforms.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Machine learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Transfer learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Unsupervised learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Metric learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Kernel learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Unlabeled data"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Challenge"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Competition"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608012000391", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608012000391", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84861787014", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84861787014", "pubmed-id": "22374109", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84861787014", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20120214", "$": "2012-02-14"}}}}}
