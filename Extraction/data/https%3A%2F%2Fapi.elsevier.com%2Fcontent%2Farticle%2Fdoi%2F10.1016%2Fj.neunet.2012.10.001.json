The vast majority of existing methods tackle the problem as an extension of the static counterpart, using dynamics, such as input derivatives, at feature level and adopting artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques originally designed for solving problems that do not specifically address the temporal aspect. The proposed approach deals with temporal and spatial aspects of the spatiotemporal domain in a discriminative as well as coupling manner. Self Organizing Maps (SOM) model the spatial aspect of the problem and Markov models its temporal counterpart. Incorporation of adjacency, both in training and classification, enhances the overall architecture with robustness and adaptability. The proposed scheme is validated both theoretically, through an error propagation study, and experimentally, on the recognition of individual signs, performed by different, native Greek Sign Language users. Results illustrate the architecture\u2019s superiority when compared to Hidden Markov Model techniques and variations both in terms of classification performance and computational cost.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Spatiotemporal pattern recognition"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Self organizing maps"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Markov models"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Probabilistic"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Sign language recognition"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608012002626", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608012002626", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84868336203", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84868336203", "pubmed-id": "23137923", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84868336203", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20121013", "$": "2012-10-13"}}}}}
