In this study, multiple signal classification (MUSIC), autoregressive (AR) and periodogram methods were used to get power spectra in patients with absence seizure. The EEG power spectra were used as an input to a classifier. We introduce two fundamentally different approaches for designing classification models (classifiers); the traditional statistical method based on logistic regression (LR) and the emerging computationally powerful techniques based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). LR as well as multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) based classifiers were developed and compared in relation to their accuracy in classification of EEG signals. The comparisons between the developed classifiers were primarily based on analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves as well as a number of scalar performance measures pertaining to the classification. The MLPNN based classifier outperformed the LR based counterpart. Within the same group, the MLPNN-based classifier was more accurate than the LR-based classifier.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "EEG"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Spectral analysis"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Epileptic seizure"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Logistic regression"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Multilayer perceptron neural network"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165027005001342", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027005001342", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "26944479675", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-26944479675", "pubmed-id": "16023730", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/26944479675", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20050714", "$": "2005-07-14"}}}}}
