An example is described based upon an experiment in which 12 rats were trained on three fixed-interval schedules of reinforcement, and a simulation of the predicted results from a packet theory of timing. An objective classification rule was used to determine whether a sample from the data or a sample from the theory was more similar to another sample from the theory. With an ideal theory, the expected probability of a correct classification would be 0.5. The observed probability of a correct classification was 0.6, which was slightly, but reliably, greater than 0.5. A Turing test provides a graded metric for the evaluation of a quantitative theory.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Time discrimination"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Turing test"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Theory evaluation"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0376635705000161", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376635705000161", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "15744368625", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-15744368625", "pubmed-id": "15795069", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/15744368625", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20050219", "$": "2005-02-19"}}}}}
