In this adaptation, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is believed to have an important role, applying executive control on other cognitive processes to achieve context switching and confidence monitoring; however, many questions remain open regarding the nature of neural processes supporting executive control. The current work explores possible mechanisms of this high-order cognitive function, transferring executing control in the domain of artificial cognitive systems. In particular, we study the self-organization of artificial neural networks accomplishing a robotic rule-switching task analogous to the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. The obtained results show that behavioral rules may be encoded in neuro-dynamic attractors, with their geometric arrangements in phase space affecting the shaping of confidence. Analysis of the emergent dynamical structures suggests possible explanations of the interactions of high-level and low-level processes in the real brain.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Neural networks"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Executive control"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Meta-cognition"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Prefrontal cortex"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Cognitive robot"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Attractor"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Self-organization"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608012001116", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608012001116", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84863875604", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84863875604", "pubmed-id": "22609533", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84863875604", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20120426", "$": "2012-04-26"}}}}}
