Thirty subjects including the guilty and innocent performed the paradigm based on three types of stimuli. In order to reduce the influence from the occasional variability of cognitive states on the CIT, several single-trials from Pz in probe stimuli within each subject were first averaged. Then the three groups of features were extracted from these averaged single-trials. Finally, two classes of feature samples were used to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Meanwhile, the optimal number of averaged Pz waveforms and some other parameter values in the classifiers were determined by the cross validation procedures. Results show that if choosing accuracy of 90% as a detecting standard of P3 component to classify a subject's status (guilty or innocent), our method can achieve individual diagnostic rate of 100%. The individual diagnostic rate of our method was higher than the results of the other related reports. The presented method improves efficiency of CIT, and is more practical, lower fatigue and less countermeasure behavior in comparison with previous report methods, which could extend the laboratory study to the practical application.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Concealed information test (CIT)"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Denoised P300"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Wavelet"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Support vector machine (SVM)"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169260710002646", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260710002646", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "80655128168", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-80655128168", "pubmed-id": "21126796", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80655128168", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20101203", "$": "2010-12-03"}}}}}
