In addition, realistic evolutionary timescales can be established based only on partially directed evolution, further complicating this issue. A division of the various evolutionary theories into two classes has been proposed based on the presence or absence of a priori information about the evolving system. A priori information plays a key role in solving problems in evolution. Here, a model of partially directed evolution, based on the learning automata theory, which includes a priori information about the fitness space, is proposed. A potential repository of such prior information is the states of biologically important molecules. Thus, the need for extended evolutionary synthesis is discussed. Experiments to test the hypothesis of partially directed evolution are proposed.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Replicator"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Decoherence"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Quantum information"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Game with incomplete information"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Partially directed evolution"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Expanded synthesis"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0303264713002165", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303264713002165", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84888335704", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84888335704", "pubmed-id": "24184874", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84888335704", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20131031", "$": "2013-10-31"}}}}}
