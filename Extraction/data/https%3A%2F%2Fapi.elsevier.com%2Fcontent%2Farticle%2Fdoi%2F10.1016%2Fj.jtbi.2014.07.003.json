The most common method for determining an unknown protein\u2019s structural class is to perform expensive and time-consuming manual experiments. Because of the availability of amino acid sequences generated in the post-genomic age, it is possible to predict an unknown protein\u2019s structural class using machine learning methods given a protein\u2019s amino-acid sequence and/or its secondary structural elements. Following recent research in this area, we propose a new machine learning system that is based on combining several protein descriptors extracted from different protein representations, such as position specific scoring matrix (PSSM), the amino-acid sequence, and secondary structural sequences. The prediction engine of our system is operated by an ensemble of support vector machines (SVMs), where each SVM is trained on a different descriptor. The results of each SVM are combined by sum rule. Our final ensemble produces a success rate that is substantially better than previously reported results on three well-established datasets.
