Taking the general nature of faults in the slave system into account, a new synchronization scheme, namely, fault tolerant synchronization, is proposed, by which the synchronization can be achieved no matter whether the faults and disturbances occur or not. By making use of a slave observer and a Lyapunov rule-based fuzzy control, fault tolerant synchronization can be achieved. Two techniques are considered as control methods: classic Lyapunov-based control and Lyapunov rule-based fuzzy control. On the basis of Lyapunov stability theory and fuzzy rules, the nonlinear controller and some generic sufficient conditions for global asymptotic synchronization are obtained. The fuzzy rules are directly constructed subject to a common Lyapunov function such that the error dynamics of two identical chaotic motions of symmetric gyros satisfy stability in the Lyapunov sense. Two proposed methods are compared. The Lyapunov rule-based fuzzy control can compensate for the actuator faults and disturbances occurring in the slave system. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed method for fault tolerant synchronization.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Fault tolerant"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Synchronization"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Chaotic gyroscope"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Nonlinear control"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Lyapunov rule-based fuzzy control"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019057811000759", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019057811000759", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "83555174846", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-83555174846", "pubmed-id": "21868010", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/83555174846", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20110824", "$": "2011-08-24"}}}}}
