Taking inspiration from neuroscience, we address this problem by utilizing artificial neural networks (NNs) as agent controllers, and mechanisms such as neuromodulation and synaptic gating. The novel aspect of this work is the introduction of a type of artificial neuron we call \u201cswitch neuron\u201d. A switch neuron regulates the flow of information in NNs by selectively gating all but one of its incoming synaptic connections, effectively allowing only one signal to propagate forward. The allowed connection is determined by the switch neuron\u2019s level of modulatory activation which is affected by modulatory signals, such as signals that encode some information about the reward received by the agent. An important aspect of the switch neuron is that it can be used in appropriate \u201cswitch modules\u201d in order to modulate other switch neurons. As we show, the introduction of the switch modules enables the creation of sequences of gating events. This is achieved through the design of a modulatory pathway capable of exploring in a principled manner all permutations of the connections arriving on the switch neurons. We test the model by presenting appropriate architectures in nonstationary binary association problems and T-maze tasks. The results show that for all tasks, the switch neuron architectures generate optimal adaptive behaviors, providing evidence that the switch neuron model could be a valuable tool in simulations where behavioral plasticity is required.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Switch neuron"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Behavioral plasticity"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Neuromodulation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Gating"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Adaptive behavior"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Reinforcement learning"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608015002142", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608015002142", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84949257093", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84949257093", "pubmed-id": "26655337", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84949257093", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20151112", "$": "2015-11-12"}}}}}
