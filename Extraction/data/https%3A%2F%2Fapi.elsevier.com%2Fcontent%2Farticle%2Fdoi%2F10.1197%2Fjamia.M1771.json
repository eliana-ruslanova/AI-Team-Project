This technology aims to optimize both clinical practice and process control by automatically coding EMR contents regardless of data input method (e.g., dictation, structured templates, typed narrative). We report on the design goals, implemented functionality, generalizability, and current status of the system. MediClass could aid both clinical operations and health services research through enhancing care quality assessment, disease surveillance, and adverse event detection.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1067502705000824", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1067502705000824", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "24044436536", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-24044436536", "pubmed-id": "15905485", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/24044436536", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20060823", "$": "2006-08-23"}}}}}
