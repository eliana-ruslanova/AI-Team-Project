Center-cut loin samples (n\u202f=\u202f85) were trimmed of subcutaneous fat and connective tissue. Images were acquired and pixels were segregated to estimate image IMF% and 18 image color features for each image. Subjective IMF% was determined by a trained grader. Ether extract IMF% was calculated using ether extract method. Image color features and image IMF% were used as predictors for stepwise regression and support vector machine models. Results showed that subjective IMF% had a correlation of 0.81 with ether extract IMF% while the image IMF% had a 0.66 correlation with ether extract IMF%. Accuracy rates for regression models were 0.63 for stepwise and 0.75 for support vector machine. Although subjective IMF% has shown to have better prediction, results from computer vision system demonstrates the potential of being used as a tool in predicting pork IMF% in the future.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Computer vision system"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Intramuscular fat"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Stepwise regression"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Support vector machine"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0309174017313207", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0309174017313207", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85045734487", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85045734487", "pubmed-id": "29684840", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85045734487", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20180326", "$": "2018-03-26"}}}}}
