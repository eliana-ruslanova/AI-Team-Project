(A) Projection along the longest axes of the microarray input image. (B) Autocorrelation of the profile, and (C) FFT of the autocorrelation. When the image is aligned, the FFT is characterized by a significant maximum that gives the average spacing. Fig. 2 The pattern recognition analysis performed by the WaveRead system. After the rotation correction and the sub-grid separation, each image corresponding to a sub-grid is analyzed separately by wavelet decomposition as described in the text, yielding two high pass images (the H and V detail images). These are processed by a filter that operates on a small window applied over them. The filter extracts the central horizontal and vertical intensity profiles on the area limited by the search window centered on the current pixel from the H and V images, respectively. The derived intensity profiles are matched to those shown above, with limits on the maxima and minima of the allowed spacing between the peaks (d) and on the peak amplitudes (a 1 and a 2). If the patterns are retained on both of the profiles, the pixel centered on the search window is classified as a candidate spot center. On the last step before gridding, the closest candidate spots are averaged together to form the center of the detected spots. Once the spot centers have been obtained, an initial irregular grid is constructed by keeping all the lines that aligned at least two spots. Then, a final grid is placed on a constraint of regularity. The undetected spots are filled in by identifying all grid points. Fig. 3 Simulated microarray images. To quantify the system behavior under different types of signal, we created microarray images by superimposing different types of spots on a background extracted from a real microarray. We simulated plain round spots (A), elliptical (B), Gaussian (C), \u201cdonut-like\u201d spots with a minimal amount of fluorescence in the middle (D), and \u201cdonut-like\u201d spots with no fluorescence in the middle (E). SNR levels are given in Table 1. Fig. 4 Scatter plots corresponding to the microarray images shown in Fig. 3. The plots compare the values read by the WaveRead algorithm with the ones generated with the image. All the spots are properly handled by the system, and even the \u201cdonut-like\u201d spots present a very high correlation. Fig. 6 Scatter plots corresponding to the microarray images shown in Fig. 5. The system is still able to grid the microarray image correctly even at 30 times the level of noise. It is more sensitive to noise for the \u201cdonut-like\u201d spots since a large part of the signal is not separable from the background. Labels correspond to those in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 Simulated microarray images with higher noise. The same types of spots are generated and superimposed on a real background with 30 times the normal level of noise for (A), (B), and (C). The \u201cdonut-like\u201d spots (D) and (E) are simulated at 7 times the normal level of noise. SNR levels are given in Table 1. Fig. 7 Comparison of the correlation between the read and actual values for the full set of simulations. The graph shows the correlation between the values determined by WaveRead and the known values in a series of simulations. The results show that WaveRead handles round, elliptical, and Gaussian spots extremely well. The \u201cdonut-like\u201d types are also properly quantified until a reasonable level of noise. In the case of the hollow spots (Figs. 3E and 5E), the gridding fails when the noise is 7 times a typical microarray (SNR of 5).

The plot shows the normalized NCI intensity on the x-axis and the normalized WaveRead intensity along the y-axis (A) or normalized commercially read intensity along the y-axis (B). The fitted lines, with forced intercepts at 0, are I WaveRead =1.017I NCI, with R 2 =0.98 for WaveRead and I commercial =1.077I NCI with R 2 =0.97 for the commercial product.

Abstract Gene expression microarrays monitor the expression levels of thousands of genes in an experiment simultaneously. To utilize the information generated, each of the thousands of spots on a microarray image must be properly quantified, including background correction. Most present methods require manual alignment of grids to the image data, and still often require additional minor adjustments on a spot by spot basis to correct for spotting irregularities. Such intervention is time consuming and also introduces inconsistency in the handling of data. A fully automatic, tested system would increase throughput and reliability in this field. In this paper, we describe WaveRead, a fully automated, standalone, open-source system for quantifying gene expression array images. Through the use of wavelet analysis to identify the spot locations and diameters, the system is able to automatically grid the image and quantify signal intensities and background corrections without any user intervention. The ability of WaveRead to perform proper quantification is demonstrated by analysis of both simulated images containing spots with donut shapes, elliptical shapes, and Gaussian intensity distributions, as well as of standard images from the National Cancer Institute. Keywords Microarrays Image analysis Wavelet decomposition 1 Introduction Recent advances in microarray technology have led to an explosion in the amount of data available for understanding cellular function and pathways, with the potential for revealing the underlying cellular behavior responsible for disease [1\u20134]. Studies have already shown that it is possible in some cases to identify disease states more accurately using mRNA expression profiles than can be done using classic pathology methods [5,6]. The fundamental idea of a microarray experiment is to perform simultaneously thousands of hybridizations of mRNA targets derived from the experimental system (e.g., cells, tumors, etc.) to cDNA probes affixed to a substrate, usually a glass microscope slide. The targets, one control and one experimental, are labeled with fluorescent probes prior to hybridization, so that for each experiment two microarray images are created (each one corresponding to the hybridization signal of a single probe). The images are then quantified and data analysis is performed. Many tools for statistical inference have been developed for microarray measurements, including SAM [7], VERAandSAM [8], ANOVA techniques [9,10], Bayesian approaches [11,12], and rank tests [13]. In addition, a number of data mining and statistical pattern recognition techniques have been applied to microarray data (for a review, see [14]). These included unsupervised techniques such as hierarchical clustering [15], principal component analysis [16], multidimensional scaling [17], Bayesian mixture models [18,19], and other clustering methods [20\u201324]. Supervised techniques have been used primarily for classification problems and include support vector machines [25] and artificial neural networks [26]. Notably a number of wavelet methods have been applied for analyzing the preprocessed data, including work determining cell cycle and metabolic periodicities [27\u201329], normalization [30], and analysis of array CGH measurements [31]. Successful analysis of microarray data depends on proper quantification of microarray images, where the measured fluorescence levels must be converted from intensity to relative transcript level. Present methods accessible to most academic and small laboratories inevitably involve significant user interaction, which both slows the high-throughput process and introduces opportunity for bias, which can seriously affect data mining. Some image analysis approaches limit user intervention, such as the method of Yang et al. [32], that relies on the presence of a batch of images where a first image is manually gridded and the others are automatically adjusted if they have a similar geometric structure. More recently, Steinfath et al. [33] have introduced an approach based on a histogram segmentation to detect the spots. Then, projections along the axes locate the grid corners and permit rotation correction. The gridding is done by dividing the input image into blocks and using their vertical and horizontal projections. In the work of Jain et al. [34], the input image is directly projected along the axes and the grid mapped using the set of local maxima of the projections. Katzer et al. [35] reviewed the existing automatic gridding methods and presented a segmentation algorithm formulated on Markov random fields. Wavelets have also been applied for some preprocessing of microarray images, including denoising [36] and spot identification using modulus maxima [37]. However, this latter method does not include rotation correction, grid recovery that is required on arrays with many low intensity spots, or automated background estimation. WaveRead is aimed to answer investigators\u2019 needs and provide part of a high-throughput microarray system. The method derives its power from the application of wavelet decomposition, which is used to segment the microarray image into signal and background, estimate spot diameters, and provide locations for recovery of grids and sub-grids. Wavelet theory has been described in detail [38] and has been applied in signal processing and imaging applications such as denoising and compression [39] and feature detection [40,41]. Wavelets consist of a signal decomposition on a family of functions defined by shifted and elongated versions of the mother wavelet, which is usually a compact function of average 0. Unlike a Fourier transform that decomposes the signal to be analysed on a family of sine functions, which is well adapted to the extraction of regularities of a signal, a wavelet transform is more adapted to identification of signal irregularities, such as features of interest in an image (i.e., microarray spots). In image processing, the wavelet decomposition is equivalent to applying a quadrature mirror filter [42] in two dimensions with high pass and low pass components on the input image, and iteration reapplies the same filter at a higher frequency on generated images. Combining wavelet analysis to identify spot locations and diameters with additional steps provides a system that does spot detection, spot size estimation, rotation correction, sub-grid determination, and a link to spot identifications. WaveRead provides an open-source, standalone microarray image analysis application that integrates array design information and links final image analysis results to gene annotations. 2 Methods 2.1 Algorithm For microarray image analysis, we incorporate a wavelet filter described in [40] that is especially well adapted to feature detection in images. However, the wavelet is implemented within a subroutine, and the code is annotated, allowing users to incorporate other wavelets. The implemented wavelet creates an approximation image A (low pass in both dimensions) and three detail images in specific directions, horizontal ( H , high pass in the horizontal direction only), vertical ( V , high pass in the vertical direction only), and diagonal ( D , high pass in both dimensions). The approximation image is further analyzed by a second pass through the wavelet transform, creating new detail images. For microarray images, the presence of a spot in the original image results in an identifiable signal in the horizontal and vertical detail images from this second transform. This signal is a set of localized parallel vertical bands and parallel horizontal bands occurring simultaneously in the V and H detail images, respectively. Identification of those bands in both detail images guarantees the detection of spots and avoids most detection of irregular signals arising from scratches and dust. There are five main steps in quantifying each image: (1) rotation correction, (2) spot detection, (3) meta-grid identification, (4) sub-grid mapping, and (5) quantification with background estimation. First, the input image is normalized so that the minimum pixel is zero and the maximum pixel is 65,535 to improve the signal for rotation correction and spot detection. Next, the input image relative to the array grid must be accurately corrected for rotation (see Fig. 1 ). A series of rotated images S \u2032 are created from the input image by rotating in 2\u00b0 increments between \u221210\u00b0 and +10\u00b0. For each S \u2032, projections are made along the horizontal and vertical axes. Each projection is autocorrelated and Fourier transformed. To correct the rotation, we use the Fourier transform of the projection along the largest dimension of the input image to insure the best accuracy. The optimal angle is the one that corresponds to a periodic signal in the autocorrelation and that gives the highest amplitude in the significant peak (see Fig. 1C). After this rough correction, the procedure is iterated on a [\u22121\u00b0, +1\u00b0] interval centered on the optimal angle retained previously with an increment of 0.1\u00b0 to obtain a finer correction. The peak in the Fourier transforms of the vertical and horizontal projections gives the periodicity of the spotting of the array horizontally and vertically, respectively (fgrix and fgriy). We use this periodicity to define a search window used later in the pattern recognition stage to locate the spots. Once the microarray has been rotated, the spots need to be identified. To speed the computation, a variance filter is applied to the input image so that the search for spot signatures is only performed on areas were there is a local maximum in the intensity. The variance filter is essentially an averaging filter using a mask of size fgridx by fgridy followed by a maxima detection stage where areas of size fgridx by fgridy with variance below a certain threshold are masked out, to avoid a feature search on low variance regions. The image is then analyzed using a wavelet transform as described above, and the H and V detail images from the first A image are retained. Pattern recognition on these images is used to find the spots through identification of the characteristic double lines with uniform separation (see Fig. 2 ). To increase the processing speed, only every other pixel in the H and V images is processed by the pattern recognition routine. Each pixel is classified as a spot center if it is at the center of the signals (extracted from the H and V images) with two positive and two negative peaks of amplitude at least a 1 and a 2 separated by a distance d (see Fig. 2). The acceptable values for d, a 1, and a 2 permit proper grid detection for images, such as those from the project normal data set [43] and NCI standard microarray images (http://dc.nci.nih.gov/dataSets/geawQCandIA), as well as from Agilent microarrays. Default values for d, a 1, and a 2 can be overridden and entered by the user as parameters. Once all the pixels have been classified as signal/nonsignal, they are clustered together on a distance basis, and the center of each cluster is retained as a spot center. Finally, we apply a spatial filter that retains only the spots having at least two neighbors separated appropriately by the grid spacings fgridx and fgridy. This filtering stage allows the suppression of extra detections that could prevent the meta-gridding algorithm from performing properly. Next, the sub-grids or blocks (meta-grids) corresponding to a printing group must be identified. At this stage, we use the information provided by the user under the form of a gene ID file that describes the spatial organization of the microarray, to extract the number of sub-grids to be found in the data. Meta-grid size mgridx and mgridy are found by multiplications of the number of spots found from the estimated spacing values fgridx and fgridy. Vertical and horizontal histograms of the detections are extracted and morphologically closed (i.e., a dilation followed by an erosion) with a mask size of fgridx and fgridy, respectively. This leads to a profile where local minima corresponding to the inter-grid spacing remain and minima related to inter-spot spacing have been filtered out. Meta-grids are then separated by locating minima on sections of size 2(mgridx) or 2(mgridy) on the morphologically closed profiles. Once the meta-grids have been detected, the next stage is the sub-grid mapping. Each area separated in the previous step is processed separately as an individual image matching a sub-grid (i.e., a pin group). Since not every spot on the array is detected in the pattern recognition stage, a grid is mapped to the input area by overlaying the detected spots with a set of possible grids using dynamic programming guided by regularity of spacing to identify the locations of undetected spots. This allows the elimination of some false positives that are detected as spots but that do not fully align with other spots, and it also locates spots with low signal intensity. This procedure treats separately the vertical and horizontal axes. The average spacing of the grid is calculated, spacings that are far removed from the average (less than half or greater than twice) are removed, and the average spacing s is recalculated. The first line is chosen, and then a line is added at a space s from the first line. If it matches an existing line the cost is zero, while a mismatch results in an increased cost. This is repeated until a line is added near the last line of the grid. The method is then repeated starting with the second line, the third, and so forth. The regular grid with the lowest cost is chosen as the true grid for the array. This is done for both the horizontal and vertical grids. The spot locations and radii (\u201cdetection discs\u201d) are determined by the separation of the lines (d in Fig. 2) defining the pattern for spot detection where possible, and by using a grid location and average radius where no direct spot detection was made. The local background intensity is estimated for each spot by creating a histogram of pixels not in the detection discs for the area including the spot and all immediately adjacent spots. The radius of the disk is estimated by measuring the distance between the maxima on each of the vertical and the horizontal profiles ( V and H images). If there is no direct detection of a spot by the wavelet analysis, an average radius is used. Practically this makes little difference as undetected spots tend to be very near background, and the background correction will adjust for reading too much nonsignal. The spot intensity is determined by integration over the disk area, subtracting the background value for each pixel, giving a total signal. Mean and median pixel intensities as well as standard deviations are also determined. The local background intensity is estimated by extracting the median of the histogram on the pixel intensity in the local area of size 3\u00d73 spots centered on the current spot with all signal pixels removed. The kernel of WaveRead has been developed in C, and a Java front-end using the Java Advanced Imaging interface handles image display, loading and data visualization. 2.2 Application to simulated data Two 16 bit gray TIFF image files are created, one in each fluorescent wavelength (typically cy3 and cy5), using standard protocols including confocal or other scanning techniques applied to a hybridized microarray (an example protocol from the Stanford group can be found in [1]). Those images are quantified and background corrected separately by WaveRead, without any user inputs. The analysis described here has been tested on multiple simulations with varying noise including \u201cgood\u201d spots (stepfunctions), donut-shaped spots, elliptical spots, and Gaussian spots. In addition, the system was used for analysis on multiple images from a Genetic Microsystems GMS418 Array Scanner (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) following hybridization of spotted microarrays with cy3 and cy5 labeled targets, and images from Agilent arrays processed on an Agilent G2565AA scanner. For the simulations, the background of each image was derived from a real microarray, and synthetic spots of various shapes and known values were superimposed on it (round, elliptic, gaussian, donut, donut2\u2013donut with no central value), as shown in Fig. 3 . Images were characterized by signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) ranging from 21.0 for the gaussian spots to 10.9 for the donut2 spots (worse). For each image, WaveRead automatically separated the sub-grids, determined the spot diameters, and background. The noise level was then systematically increased to probe how WaveRead handles poorer quality images, until the levels shown in Fig. 5 where noise levels were seven times normal for the donut-shaped spots with no central intensity (panel E) and 30 times normal for the others. SNRs ranged from a median value of 2.63 (best) for the gaussian spots to 1.76 for the elliptical spots (worse). Table 1 summarizes median, minimum, and maximum SNR values for the series of plotted images. 2.3 Application to NCI gold standard images The system was also tested by analysis of the NCI standard microarray images. Those images were especially generated for the purpose of being reference images to compare different quantification methods. They are organized into two sets of 70 microarrays from different manufacturers. Each set compares human tissues from heart, brain, and placenta with different types of cancer. They have been properly quantified by NCI using GenePix. In each case the system automatically identified many of the spots, correctly produced the proper grid, and read all values and backgrounds. This included numerous low quality images with significant artifactual signals from dust or scratches as well as poor background. The computation time including rotation correction for a 10 Mbyte TIFF image from NCI organized in four sub-grids containing a total of 10,000 spots is about 200s on a 800MHz Pentium III Linux system, and depends linearly with the image size, number of pixels in the search window, and number of spots. 3 Results 3.1 Application to simulated data The simulations on the synthetic microarrays gave good results. For the images in Fig. 3, the scatter plots of measured intensity vs known intensity are shown in Fig. 4 . The correlations for all images are excellent, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.957 for donut-shaped spots with no central intensity (panel E) to 0.999 for elliptical and round spots (panels A and B). For the increased noise levels, the quality of the quantification decreased slightly with increasing noise for the round, elliptical, and Gaussian spots, while for the donut-shaped spots the decrease was sharper. For donuts with some inner intensity (typical of those seen in microarray images), the decrease was uniform with noise. However, for donuts with no central intensity, there was a sudden loss of fidelity when the noise level reached eight times the typical noise level seen (SNR\u223c5). At this point the gridding failed, resulting in the grid size being misestimated (25\u00d720 instead of 24\u00d724). This illustrates one of the advantages of WaveRead: gross misestimation of transcript levels corresponds to incorrect gridding, a parameter that can be checked automatically while reading a series of images. Fig. 6 shows the scatter plots of measured intensity vs known intensity for the images in Fig. 5 . The fidelity of the reading was further studied by calculating the correlation coefficient between the known values in the simulations and the quantification for increasing noise levels (Fig. 7 ). As can be seen, the correlation remains excellent even at high noise for well-defined spots (round, elliptical, Gaussian), with some decrease in fidelity for typical donut spots. For donut spots with no central intensity, as noted earlier, the loss of fidelity is dramatic but easily identified from the incorrect gridding. 3.2 Application to NCI gold standard images We tested the system by comparing the results for automatic quantification of the NCI test images, available at http://dc.nci.nih.gov/dataSets/geawQCandIA, with values determined by NCI. The results for the normalized values from the two methods are plotted in Fig. 8 . The values read automatically by this system agree closely with the standard values determined by NCI when compared by linear regression of the corrected WaveRead intensity estimates against the NCI gold standard values (I WaveRead =1.017 I NCI, R 2 =0.98, where I WaveRead is the WaveRead estimate of spot intensity, I NCI is the NCI gold standard value, and R 2 provides the correlation coefficient). In addition, we read the microarray images with a widely used commercial product and compared the results to the NCI measurements. The results gave a similar fit and correlation in linear regression analysis to the automatic reading by the wavelet system (I commercial =1.077 I NCI, R 2 =0.97, where I commercial is the commercial program estimate of spot intensity) although with much more manual intervention in grid alignment and sub-grid identification required by the user. 4 Conclusion WaveRead provides a reliable and fast tool for the high-throughput analysis of microarray images. Presently, a great deal of time and effort is required to obtain high-quality, reproducible measurements from microarray images. Present methods used in academic laboratories generally involve manual placing of grids and flagging of spots, which can introduce potential bias that feeds into later data mining. WaveRead is designed to avoid both the effort of manual placement of grids and detection discs and the potential introduction of bias. WaveRead uses a number of mathematical methods to correctly locate and measure each spot on the microarray. An initial correction for misalignment of the array with the image is performed by autocorrelation and Fourier analysis of the projections of the input image. The sub-grids are also determined by auto-correlation of the projections. For each sub-grid, a wavelet decomposition of the corresponding area of the input image is performed and used as a two dimensional edge detector. The spot radii are estimated using the edges detected during the wavelet decomposition stage. The grid is determined by a simple dynamic programming method with a strong constraint on the regularity of the grid to ensure that the best possible grid is retained. Finally the spots and background are measured by using the estimated radii for image segmentation, with the background being estimated by the median of the local background. The accuracy of the quantification has been verified both by simulation and by analysis of the NCI standard. Here, we propose a new method that does not require any user intervention, can rectify misaligned images, and support microarrays with multiple sub-grids.
