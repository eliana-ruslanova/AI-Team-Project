The approach incorporates the recently developed Self-adaptive Resource Allocation Network (SRAN) for Alzheimer\u2019s disease classification using voxel-based morphometric features of MR images. SRAN classifier uses a sequential learning algorithm, employing self-adaptive thresholds to select the appropriate training samples and discard redundant samples to prevent over-training. These selected training samples are then used to evolve the network architecture efficiently. Since, the number of features extracted from the MR images is large, a feature selection scheme (to reduce the number of features needed) using an Integer-Coded Genetic Algorithm (ICGA) in conjunction with the SRAN classifier (referred to here as the ICGA\u2013SRAN classifier) have been developed. In this study, different healthy/Alzheimer\u2019s disease patient\u2019s MR images from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies data set have been used for the performance evaluation of the proposed ICGA\u2013SRAN classifier. We have also compared the results of the ICGA\u2013SRAN classifier with the well-known Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifiers. The study results clearly show that the ICGA\u2013SRAN classifier produces a better generalization performance with a smaller number of features, lower misclassification rate and a compact network. The ICGA\u2013SRAN selected features clearly indicate that the variations in the gray matter volume in the parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala brain regions may be good indicators of the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease in normal persons.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Voxel-based morphometry"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Self-adaptive Resource Allocation Network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Integer coded genetic algorithm"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608012000640", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608012000640", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84861781339", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84861781339", "pubmed-id": "22391013", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84861781339", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20120216", "$": "2012-02-16"}}}}}
