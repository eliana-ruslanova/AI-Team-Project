This \u201cexact replica\u201d brings to mind the close analogy Husserl saw between our intuition of essences in Wesensschau and of physical objects in perception. What is it like to experience a mathematical proving process? What is the ontological status of a mathematical proof? Can computer assisted provers output a proof? Taking a naturalized world account, I will assess the relationship between mathematics, the physical world and consciousness by introducing a significant conceptual distinction between proving and proof. I will propose that proving is a phenomenological conscious experience. This experience involves a combination of what Kurt G\u00f6del called intuition, and what Husserl called intentionality. In contrast, proof is a function of that process \u2014 the mathematical phenomenon \u2014 that objectively self-presents a property in the world, and that results from a spatiotemporal unity being subject to the exact laws of nature. In this essay, I apply phenomenology to mathematical proving as a performance of consciousness, that is, a lived experience expressed and formalized in language, in which there is the possibility of formulating intersubjectively shareable meanings.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Mathematical proof"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Proving"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Intuition"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Intention"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Phenomenological conscious experience"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Shareable meanings"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Neutral language"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Natural science"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0079610715000899", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079610715000899", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84949219203", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84949219203", "pubmed-id": "26160643", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84949219203", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20150706", "$": "2015-07-06"}}}}}
