The goal of this paper is to further improve the response generation, using personalization criteria. We propose a novel method called PRGDDA (Personalized Response Generation by Dual-learning based Domain Adaptation) which is a personalized response generation model based on theories of domain adaptation and dual learning. During the training procedure, PRGDDA first learns the human responding style from large general data (without user-specific information), and then fine-tunes the model on a small size of personalized data to generate personalized conversations with a dual learning mechanism. We conduct experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model on two real-world datasets in both English and Chinese. Experimental results show that our model can generate better personalized responses for different users.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Personalized response generation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Domain adaptation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Deep reinforcement learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Dual learning"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608018300947", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608018300947", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85045705590", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85045705590", "pubmed-id": "29665538", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85045705590", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20180405", "$": "2018-04-05"}}}}}
