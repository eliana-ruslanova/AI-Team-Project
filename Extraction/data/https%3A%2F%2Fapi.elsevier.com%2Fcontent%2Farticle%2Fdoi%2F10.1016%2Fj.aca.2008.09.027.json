Visible/near-infrared (Vis/NIR) spectroscopy was investigated for fast and non-destructive determination of ALS activity and protein content in rapeseed leaves. Partial least squares (PLS) analysis was the calibration method with comparison of different spectral preprocessing by Savitzky\u2013Golay (SG) smoothing, standard normal variate (SNV), first and second derivative. The best PLS models were obtained by first-derivative spectra for ALS, whereas original spectra for soluble, non-soluble and total protein contents. Simultaneously, certain latent variables (LVs) were used as the inputs of back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and least squares-support vector machine (LS-SVM) models. All LS-SVM models outperformed PLS models and BPNN models. The correlation coefficient (r), root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and bias in validation set by LS-SVM were 0.998, 0.715 and 0.079 for ALS, 0.999, 33.084 and 1.178 for soluble protein, 0.997, 42.773 and 6.244 for non-soluble protein, 0.999, 59.562 and 7.437 for total protein, respectively. The results indicated that Vis/NIR spectroscopy combined with LS-SVM could be successfully applied for the determination of ALS activity and protein content of rapeseed leaves. The results would be helpful for further on field analysis of using Vis/NIR spectroscopy to monitor the growing status and physiological properties of oilseed rape.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Visible/near-infrared spectroscopy"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Oilseed rape"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Acetolactate synthase and protein content"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Partial least squares analysis"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Back-propagation neural network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Least squares-support vector machine"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003267008016188", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003267008016188", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "53649094994", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-53649094994", "pubmed-id": "18940321", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/53649094994", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20080917", "$": "2008-09-17"}}}}}
