Each harmonic oscillator is driven by chaotic force whose bifurcation parameter is modulated by the position of the harmonic oscillator. Moreover, a system of mutually coupled chaotic neural networks was investigated. Different patterns were stored in each network and the associative memory problem was discussed in these networks. Each network can retrieve the pattern stored in the other network.\n                  On the other hand, we have been developing new mechanisms and functions for a humanoid robot with the ability to express emotions and communicate with humans in a human-like manner. We introduced a mental model which consisted of the mental space, the mood, the equations of emotion, the robot personality, the need model, the consciousness model and the behavior model. This type of mental model was implemented in Emotion Expression Humanoid Robot WE-4RII (Waseda Eye No.4 Refined II).\n                  In this paper, an associative memory model using mutually coupled chaotic neural networks is proposed for retrieving optimum memory (recognition) in response to a stimulus. We implemented this model in Emotion Expression Humanoid Robot WE-4RII (Waseda Eye No.4 Refined II).\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Neural network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Associative memory"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Humanoid robot"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608005001279", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608005001279", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "27744472101", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-27744472101", "pubmed-id": "16109473", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/27744472101", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20050818", "$": "2005-08-18"}}}}}
