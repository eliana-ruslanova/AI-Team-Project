In this paper, a type of neural network (NN-GP) is presented in which: (i) each neuron may have its own neuron model in the form of a general function, (ii) any layout (i.e network interconnection) is possible, and (iii) no bias nodes or weights are associated to the connections, neurons or layers. The general functions associated to a neuron are learned by searching a function space. They are not provided a priori, but are rather built as part of an Evolutionary Computation process based on Genetic Programming. The resulting network solutions are evaluated based on a fitness measure, which may, for example, be based on classification or regression errors. Two real-world examples are presented to illustrate the promising behaviour on classification problems via construction of a low-dimensional representation of a high-dimensional parameter space associated to the set of all network solutions.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "General neuron model"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Evolutionary Computation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Genetic Programming"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hybrid algorithm"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Machine learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Parameter space"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Visualization"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608009001488", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608009001488", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "68149160210", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-68149160210", "pubmed-id": "19604672", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/68149160210", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20090703", "$": "2009-07-03"}}}}}
