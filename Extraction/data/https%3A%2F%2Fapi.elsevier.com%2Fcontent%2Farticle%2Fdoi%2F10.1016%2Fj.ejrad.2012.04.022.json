CT colonography is a recent arrival to CAD, but could represent one of its most fruitful applications in the future. In contrast to other organs, where a variety of different pathologies are equally represented, significant colorectal pathologies other than polyps and cancer are relatively uncommon. As we shall see, this simplifies the diagnostic task for artificial intelligence developers and also for radiologists who, ultimately, must make the final decision.\n                  This review aims to present the current state-of-the-art for CAD applied to CT colonography. A brief overview of the technical essentials and of the diagnostic performance of CAD in isolation, is followed by an explanation of how CAD is used in day-to-day practice. The last section will deal with the most controversial issues affecting CAD performance in clinical practice, with a focus on the interaction between human and artificial intelligence.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD)"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "CT colonography (CTC)"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Colorectal cancer"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0720048X12001970", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0720048X12001970", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84879497748", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84879497748", "pubmed-id": "22595503", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84879497748", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20120516", "$": "2012-05-16"}}}}}
