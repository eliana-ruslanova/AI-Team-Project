It is suitable for experience-based and theory-less problems. Building a semantically intelligent CBR that mimic the expert thinking can solve many problems especially medical ones.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  Knowledge-intensive CBR using formal ontologies is an evolvement of this paradigm. Ontologies can be used for case representation and storage, and it can be used as a background knowledge. Using standard medical ontologies, such as SNOMED CT, enhances the interoperability and integration with the health care systems. Moreover, utilizing vague or imprecise knowledge further improves the CBR semantic effectiveness. This paper proposes a fuzzy ontology-based CBR framework. It proposes a fuzzy case-base OWL2 ontology, and a fuzzy semantic retrieval algorithm that handles many feature types.\n               \n               \n                  Material\n                  This framework is implemented and tested on the diabetes diagnosis problem. The fuzzy ontology is populated with 60 real diabetic cases. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated with a set of experiments and case studies.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  The resulting system can answer complex medical queries related to semantic understanding of medical concepts and handling of vague terms. The resulting fuzzy case-base ontology has 63 concepts, 54 (fuzzy) object properties, 138 (fuzzy) datatype properties, 105 fuzzy datatypes, and 2640 instances. The system achieves an accuracy of 97.67%. We compare our framework with existing CBR systems and a set of five machine-learning classifiers; our system outperforms all of these systems.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion\n                  Building an integrated CBR system can improve its performance. Representing CBR knowledge using the fuzzy ontology and building a case retrieval algorithm that treats different features differently improves the accuracy of the resulting systems.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Case-based reasoning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Knowledge based system"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Fuzzy ontology"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Semantic retrieval"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Diabetes diagnosis"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Standard SNOMED CT terminology"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0933365715000925", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365715000925", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84983487369", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84983487369", "pubmed-id": "26303105", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84983487369", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20150814", "$": "2015-08-14"}}}}}
