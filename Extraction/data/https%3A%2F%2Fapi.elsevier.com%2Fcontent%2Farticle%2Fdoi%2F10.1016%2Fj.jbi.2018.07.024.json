Abstract The synergistic effect of drug combination is one of the most desirable properties for treating cancer. However, systematically predicting effective drug combination is a significant challenge. We report here a novel method based on deep belief network to predict drug synergy from gene expression, pathway and the Ontology Fingerprints\u2014a literature derived ontological profile of genes. Using data sets provided by 2015 DREAM competition, our analysis shows that this integrative method outperforms published results from the DREAM website for 4999 drug pairs, demonstrating the feasibility of predicting drug synergy from literature and the \u2013omics data using advanced artificial intelligence approach. Keywords Drug combination Deep belief network Ontology fingerprint 1 Introduction Combining drugs to treat cancer has significant benefit over single agent therapy. In combination therapy, using several drugs can significant boost the efficacy of the therapy, and the amount of drugs used can be reduced to alleviate the toxicity while maintaining the effectiveness to kill cancer cells. Effective drug combination relies on the synergy between drugs\u2014the more than additive effect that cannot be predicted by well-established Loewe model [1,2]. Experimental detection of such synergy is time consuming and costly, especially for the extremely large search space of the combination of drugs, genes and cell lines. For this reason, computational methods have been playing a crucial role to predict drug synergy. ANOVA (Analysis of variance) was the first computational method used to detect drug synergy [3\u201311]. However, the approach was proven to be invalid by Robert M. Caudle and Gene M. Williams [12] because the condition to support the use of ANOVA is not meet. The assumption underlying the null hypothesis of ANOVA is that the dose-response curve for combined drugs should parallel to that of drug alone when the effects are additive, a condition that is not generally correct. Later on, a network and clustering analyses approach was used [13] to highlight common interactions of drugs to predict drug synergy. However, this network has limited application because it only used the most synergistic subsets of drug combinations based on Delta Bliss Summary metric. Machine learning methods, such as Random Forests and Support Vector Machines, are broadly used for drug synergy detection [14,15]. Recently, these methods were reportedly been outperformed by DeepSynergy [16] with an improvement of 7.2% over the closest second method. DeepSynergy is a feed forward neural network that takes the chemical descriptors of each drug and the genomic information of the cell line as inputs. Biological pathways have been extensively used in predicting effective drug combination [17\u201322]. The most used pathway database for this purpose is the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) [23], a collection of gold standard sets of molecular pathways, where a biological pathway is a series of gene interactions among molecules in a cell for a specific species, which is initiated by a biological event or state change occurring over time. Human Interactome is another pathway database focused on human biological pathways. Pathways are used to model dose-response and drug combination [20], develop pathway-pathway interaction network [22] and simulated network-regulation dynamics [19] to predict drug combination, demonstrating its indispensable role in predicting effective drug combination. Integrating literature information could further improve drug synergy prediction. This could be accomplished through Ontology Fingerprint, a method based on biomedical literature and ontologies [24]. The Ontology Fingerprint for a gene is a set of ontology terms that occurs more commonly in MEDLINE abstracts about the gene than in the background. Ontology Fingerprints were used to evaluate results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), to infer active signaling pathways in cancer, disambiguate gene names in the literature, and identify novel pathway players [25\u201327]. However, integrating Ontology Fingerprints with genomic information and cell line for drug synergy prediction is challenging as it requires integrating supervised and unsupervised learning approaches. While the above mentioned works in predicting drug combination employed extensive quantitative approaches, none of them employed deep learning framework such as stacked Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). RBM is a generative stochastic artificial neural network [28,29] with a bipartite structure. Multiple RBMs can be stacked together to form a deep belief network. In this stacked RBM, the weights of the inputs could be optimized using Contrastive Divergence prior to the Learning phase with training data. The ability of the stacked RBM to combine unsupervised and supervised learning makes this deep belief networks favorable for integrating Ontology Fingerprints, genomic information and cell line data, particularly for problems with these large number of inputs, to predict drug synergy. In this study, we developed a stacked restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) [29\u201332] deep learning model to combine information from Ontology Fingerprints [25\u201327,33], gene expression and pathway information to predict the synergy of drugs. 2 Methods 2.1 Materials & data source The gene expression data and drug-target list used in this project were obtained from the AstraZeneca-Sanger Drug Combination Prediction (DREAM, www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn4231880) Challenge. The dataset generated by the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) project contains gene expression values of 17,419 HUGO (Human Genome Organization) genes for 83 cell lines. The drug target data includes 118 drugs, with each targeting one or more genes. The Ontology Fingerprints was described previously [26]. Synergy scores for 4999 pair of drugs for 83 cell lines were downloaded from DREAM as training data. The information of human pathways are extracted from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). 2.2 The stacked RBMs based deep belief network Fig. 1 shows the workflow to employ stacked RBMs to predict drug synergy. In this model, the Ontology Fingerprints of these genes derived from literature, the expression value of genes targeted by known drugs and the pathway information were used as input for the deep belief network. To integrate gene expression information, we modeled the gene expression values across different cell lines as a Gaussian curve excluding those outliers. Based on this approach, we considered a gene in a cell line as active if its expression in this cell line reaches a certain level [34]. Specifically, we selected one standard deviation from the mean as the upper bound of gene expression, and considered a gene as active for a cell line only when its expression value in that cell line is within the upper tail. Using this criteria, we obtained different number of active genes for each cell line, ranging from 2000 to 5000 for the 83 cell lines used (For details, see Supplementary Table provided). Only these active genes were used when constructing the inputs of the neurons. We created an RBM model for each cell line to predict the synergy between every two drugs. This model is based on the Gaussian-Bernoulli restricted Boltzmann machine implemented by Masayuki Tanaka [32], which could be obtained from Mathworks (www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/42853-deep-neural-network). We used four layers for the neural network with 800, 600, 200 and 1 node(s) for each layer respectively. The input for each neuron of the RBM model is a quantified interaction of two genes\u2014drug A targeted gene i and drug B targeted gene j\u2014which can be obtained with Eq. (1). This input is a product of: (a) the similarity scores sim ij between drug targeted genes derived from the Ontology Fingerprints; (b) the ranking of these two genes (R i and R j) in the cell line considered based on their expression value [11]; and (c) Iij , the inverse of the topological distance of the two target genes in the hierarchical clustering results obtained from the extended KEGG pathways that these two target genes belong to. (1) X ij = s i m ij \u2217 R i \u2217 R j \u2217 I ij where (1-1) si m ij = \u2211 k = 1 O log F i k log F j k m a x 1 , \u2211 k = 1 O C F i k < 1 C F j k = 1 (1-2) R i = G i - G min G max - G min (1-3) I ij = 1 H i \u2217 H j (a) The similarity score As described previously, we calculated the similarity of Ontology Fingerprints of two genes as an indication of their biological relevance [33]. This similarity is calculated using Eq. (1-1), where k\u202f=\u202f1, 2, \u2026, O represents the ontology terms in the Ontology Fingerprint of gene i or gene j, and F i k and F j k refers to the enrichment p-value of the ontology term k for gene i and gene j respectively. The denominator represents the number of the unmatched ontology terms in the Ontology Fingerprints of these two genes compared. Further details can be found in the original method published [33]. (b) The ranking based on gene expression value To integrate gene expression value, we used Ri, the rank of the expression level of a gene calculated from the min-max method. In Eq. (1-2), Gi represents the expression value of gene i, Gmax represents the highest expression value among all the genes for that cell line, and Gmin the lowest. (c) Biological pathways Drug targeted genes were mapped to the KEGG pathways [23,35]. For each of these identified pathways, we calculated the similarity scores of the Ontology Fingerprints of all the gene pairs within the pathway. The medium of these scores within each pathway was used as a threshold to indicate the biological relevance of other genes to this pathway\u2014if the similarity score between a gene outside the pathway and another gene within the pathway is higher than this threshold, this gene is considered biologically relevant to the pathway gene and the pathway. Based on this condition, the threshold for each pathway is used to identify the first order neighbors of drug target genes within or outside the pathway. The first order neighbors of all the genes in a particular pathway were selected based on this condition. Genes in each pathway and their identified first order neighbors were then combined as the expanded pathway and clustered with InfoMap [36]. The relative position between two genes in the resulting hierarchal structure was used as input to indicate the two genes\u2019 relationship in this expanded pathway. In Eq. (1-3), Hi and H j represent the distances of gene i and known drug target gene j to their closest common ancestor respectively [37]. Eq. (2) is the activation function of the RBM model. The output of this model is a decimal number between 0 and 1, where a value greater than 0.5 indicates drug synergy and smaller than 0.5 means no synergy. (2) S ij = 1 1 + e - s where Sij is the output of the deep belief network model for drug i and j, and s is the resulted synergistic value of the last hidden layer in the model. 2.3 Model training The drug synergy data provided by DREAM2015 for training in sub-challenge one (Drug Combination Challenge) was used to train the above model. We observed that part of the data are heavily imbalanced. These unbalanced cases are processed using Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) [38,39]. SMOTE addresses the imbalanced training data set problem by adding new minority class instances where the new instances are replicated from the minority class with a small randomized offsets. We used cross entropy to measure the weights learning. The hyper parameters for the learning are: the maximum number of iteration is 200, the cost of weight is 0.0001; the dropout rate is 0.5; the step ratio is 0.01; the batch size (the number of mini-batch data) is 100; the q parameter of sparse learning is 0.01 and the lambda parameter (weight) of sparse learning is 0.0095. Considering most of the dimensions of the training cases for a cell lines are very limited, we used leave one out approach to evaluate the performance of this deep belief model. 3 Results 3.1 Predicting drug synergy Out of the 4999 pairs of known drug combinations provided by DREAM2015, 3200 have synergistic effect and the rest 1799 have no observed synergy. The deep learning model we developed detected 1927 out these 3200 pairs as synergistic and 1030 out of the 1799 pairs as negative, resulted in a precision of 71.5%, a recall of 60.2% and the F score of 65.4%. The comparison of our results with that of the best performer of DREAM2015 participants in each round in best precision, best recall or best F score is shown in Table 1 . Looking into the results for each of the 83 cell lines, we can see most of the cell lines have high precision and F scores. Table 2 shows the number of cell lines with precision, recall and F score fall into 4 different scopes, and Fig. 2 illustrates the splits in each scope for all cell lines. 3.2 Impact of training data on performance of the model To better understand how the prediction is affected by training data, we plotted the precision, recall and F measure for each cell line with respect to the ratio of synergistic drug pairs out of all training pairs. Fig. 3 shows that precision and F measure are significantly affected by the portion of the positive training case, while recall remains stable when the ratio gets around 40\u201380%. Notabely, the steep lines of recall is a result of extremely low number of targeted genes, typically 1 or 2 genes for both drugs tested for synergy. 4 Discussion In this project, we combined the literature and ontology based Ontology Fingerprint, the drug target information, the gene expression data and the pathway information to predict the synergy of drug combination using stacked RBMs deep learning method. For the purpose of synergy detection, the method achieved an overall precision of 71.5%, recall of 60.2% and F score of 65.4%. In comparison with the 84 participants of DREAM 2015, the precision, recall and F score for the group with the highest precision are 65%, 14% and 23%; the one with highest recall are 25%, 94% and 39%; and the one with highest F measure are 42%, 55% and 48% respectively. Therefore, the stacked RBMs based deep belief model we developed outperformed the participating groups of the DREAM 2015 based on the posted results on DREAM website. The primary measurement method used in DREAM2015 is a 3-way ANOVA with three assumptions: (1) The synergy scores are normally distributed; (2) The measured drug combinations are independent; and (3) Variances of the different groups are equal. However, these assumptions are questionable. First, The required format of synergy score for submission is binary, i.e. either 0 or 1, which indicates that the synergy scores are obviously not normally distributed. Second, The ANOVA test takes three variables \u2013 the drug combinations, the cell lines and the synergy scores. However, none of the 3 variables are independent of each other. The synergy scores of the same drug combination on different cell lines are different, and different drug combination on the same cell line has different synergy score. The above mentioned inter-dependency strongly influences the data and their distribution. As such, there is no guaranty that the variances of the different groups are equal, which is demonstrated in the results obtained. Therefore, we believe that using 3-way ANOVA as primary performance metric is not suitable for evaluating the drug combination prediction for this competition. Fortunately, DREAM2015 also provided precision, recall and F1 measure for all the participating teams, making it possible for us to directly compare our performance against these teams using these measures that are widely used in evaluating machine learning algorithms. We used the same data sets obtained from DREAM2015 to train our model. Since we can only use the published labeled data from DREAM2015, we used leave-one-out cross validation\u2014a very popular approach in evaluating machine learning algorithms\u2014to avoid the bias in our evaluation. By extending existing pathways with the first neighbors of the drug targeted genes, additional relevant genes are taken into account in this model to improve its robustness. However, the extension greatly increased the number of inputs and therefore, the need of weight training for the model. As a semi-supervised method, stacked RBMs based deep belief network consists of an unsupervised phase followed by a supervised learning phase\u2014an approach suitable for the data we have in this project. However, the integrity of the supplied data and the lack of experimental data could have significant impact on the performance of the model, and we took extra effort to integrate different data sets to address this problem. Fig. 3 shows that the performance of the model is notably affected by the amount of the synergistic training data. When the portion of positive training case increases, the precision and F1 measure are improved with an appropriate ratio. However, the recall has a slightly higher variance. Further looking into the training data for the extreme cases, we found two cases for the cell line NCI-H1793 that are classified as non-synergistic even without negative training case. It shows that the extremely imbalanced training data did not bias the prediction, which demonstrates the robustness of the model. One advantage of deep believe network is that with sufficient, well annotated training data, we can develop reasonably good model to make predictions without knowing the underneath mechanisms. This allows us to expand current model to include other type of data, such as mutation, mythylation or proteomics data. Such expandability makes it possible to maximize the utility of our approach by incorporating data obtained in the future. 5 Conflict of interest statement The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.
