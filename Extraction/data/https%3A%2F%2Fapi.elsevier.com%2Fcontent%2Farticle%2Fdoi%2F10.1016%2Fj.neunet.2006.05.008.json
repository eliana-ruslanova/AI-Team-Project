Usually these experiences are obtained by trial and error. The criteria for success and failure are based on our own knowledge or advice given by others. The Self-Organizing Relationship (SOR) network has been inspired by this process and has been proposed to emulate this process computationally. In the previous applications of the SOR network for controller design, the evaluation criteria have been assigned by using mathematical expressions. Generally, however, mathematical expressions of the evaluation criteria become difficult as the complexity of a target system increases. On the other hand, human beings can contrive to express their knowledge for evaluation by using heuristic expressions, although a target system is complicated. In this study, we employ fuzzy inference in order to realize heuristic expressions of the evaluation criteria.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Self-organization"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Self-Organizing Relationship (SOR) network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Evaluation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Heuristic knowledge"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Trailer-truck back-up control"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Fuzzy inference"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608006000761", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608006000761", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "33746620037", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-33746620037", "pubmed-id": "16781846", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33746620037", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20060616", "$": "2006-06-16"}}}}}
