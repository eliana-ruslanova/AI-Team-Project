Although the ISPS's prediction of speeding has been validated, whether the ISPS can regulate a driver's speed behavior or whether a driver accepts the ISPS needs further investigation. Additionally, compared to the existing intelligent speed adaptation (ISA) system, whether the ISPS performs better in terms of reducing excessive speeds and improving driving safety needs more direct evidence.\n               \n               \n                  Objectives\n                  An experiment was conducted to assess and compare the effectiveness and acceptance of the ISPS and the ISA.\n               \n               \n                  Method\n                  We conducted a driving simulator study with 40 participants. System type served as a between-subjects variable with four levels: no speed assistance system, pre-warning system developed based on the ISPS, post-warning system ISA, and combined pre-warning and ISA system. Speeding criterion served as a within-subjects variable with two levels: lower (posted speed limit plus 1mph) and higher (posted speed limit plus 5mph) speed threshold. Several aspects of the participants\u2019 driving speed, speeding measures, lead vehicle response, and subjective measures were collected.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  Both pre-warning and combined systems led to greater minimum time-to-collision. The combined system resulted in slower driving speed, fewer speeding exceedances, shorter speeding duration, and smaller speeding magnitude.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  The results indicate that both pre-warning and combined systems have the potential to improve driving safety and performance.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Speeding"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Speeding prediction"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Speed assistance system"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Intelligent speed adaptation (ISA)"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001457512004356", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457512004356", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84872253343", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84872253343", "pubmed-id": "23298705", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84872253343", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20130106", "$": "2013-01-06"}}}}}
