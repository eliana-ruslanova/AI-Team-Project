However, there are far few computational models for predicting plant protein subcellular multi-localization. In this paper, we propose a multi-label multi-kernel transfer learning model for predicting multiple subcellular locations of plant proteins (MLMK-TLM). The method proposes a multi-label confusion matrix and adapts one-against-all multi-class probabilistic outputs to multi-label learning scenario, based on which we further extend our published work MK-TLM (multi-kernel transfer learning based on Chou's PseAAC formulation for protein submitochondria localization) for plant protein subcellular multi-localization. By proper homolog knowledge transfer, MLMK-TLM is applicable to novel plant protein subcellular localization in multi-label learning scenario. The experiments on plant protein benchmark dataset show that MLMK-TLM outperforms the baseline model. Unlike the existing models, MLMK-TLM also reports its misleading tendency, which is important for comprehensive survey of model's multi-labeling performance.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Multi-label learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Transfer learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Nonparametric multiple kernel learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Protein subcellular localization"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Performance overestimation"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519312003153", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519312003153", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84863695726", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84863695726", "pubmed-id": "22750634", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84863695726", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20120627", "$": "2012-06-27"}}}}}
