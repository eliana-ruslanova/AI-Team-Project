We examined the use of AI in ehealth practices to promote immediacy and provided examples from the ChronologyMD project.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  Strategic use of AI is shown to help enhance immediacy in ehealth programs by making health communication more engaging, relevant, exciting, and actionable.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion\n                  AI can enhance the \u201cimmediacy\u201d of ehealth by humanizing health promotion efforts, promoting physical and emotional closeness, increasing authenticity and enthusiasm in health promotion efforts, supporting personal involvement in communication interactions, increasing exposure to relevant messages, reducing demands on healthcare staff, improving program efficiency, and minimizing costs.\n               \n               \n                  Practice implications\n                  User-centered AI approaches, such as the use of personally involving verbal and nonverbal cues, natural language translation, virtual coaches, and comfortable human\u2013computer interfaces can promote active information processing and adoption of new ideas.
