The small-animal system was used as a model system to test different processing methods for the prosthetic control system. The best methods were then validated in the human set-up. The recorded EMGs were classified using different ANN algorithms, and it was found that a modified self-organising feature map (SOFM) composed of a combination of a Kohonen network and the conscience mechanism algorithm (KNC) was superior in performance to the reference networks (e.g. multi-layer perceptrons) as regards training time, low memory consumption, and simplicity in finding optimal training parameters and architecture. The KNC network classified both experimental set-ups with high accuracy, including five movements for the animal set-up and seven for the human set-up.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial neural network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "SOFM"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "EMG"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Pattern recognition"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hand prosthesis"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Receptive field"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Reflex responses"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1350453304001742", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350453304001742", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "20944442083", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-20944442083", "pubmed-id": "15863349", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/20944442083", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20050219", "$": "2005-02-19"}}}}}
