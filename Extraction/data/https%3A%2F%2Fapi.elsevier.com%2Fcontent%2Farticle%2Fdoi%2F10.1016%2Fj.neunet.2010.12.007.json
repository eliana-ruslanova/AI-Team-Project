This paper is motivated by a recent work of Coifman and Maggioni on diffusion wavelets to accomplish such projections approximately using iterates of the heat kernel. In greater generality, we consider a quasi-metric measure space \n                        X\n                      (in place of the manifold), and a very general operator \n                        T\n                      defined on the class of integrable functions on \n                        X\n                      (in place of the diffusion map). We develop a representation of functions on \n                        X\n                      in terms of linear combinations of iterates of \n                        T\n                     . Our construction obviates the need to compute the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the operator. In addition, the local smoothness of a function \n                        f\n                      is characterized by the local norm behavior of the terms in our representation of \n                        f\n                     . This property is similar to that of the classical wavelet representations. Although the operator \n                        T\n                      utilizes the values of the target function on the entire space, this ability results in automatic \u201cfeature detection\u201d, leading to a parsimonious representation of the target function. In the case when \n                        X\n                      is a smooth compact manifold (without boundary), our theory allows \n                        T\n                      to be any operator that commutes with the heat operator, subject to certain conditions on its eigenvalues. In particular, \n                        T\n                      can be chosen to be the heat operator itself, or a Green\u2019s operator corresponding to a suitable pseudo-differential operator.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Data defined manifolds"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Diffusion wavelets"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Littlewood\u2013Paley decomposition"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Kernel based methods"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Local Besov spaces"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608011000219", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608011000219", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "79951960697", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-79951960697", "pubmed-id": "21315554", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79951960697", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20110120", "$": "2011-01-20"}}}}}
