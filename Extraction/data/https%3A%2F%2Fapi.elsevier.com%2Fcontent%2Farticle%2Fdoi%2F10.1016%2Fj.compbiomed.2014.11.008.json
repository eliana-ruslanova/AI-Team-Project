Successful identification of candidate drug targets in entire genomes is very useful, and computational prediction methods can speed up this process. In the current work we have developed a sequence-based prediction method for the successful identification and discrimination of human drug target proteins, from human non-drug target proteins. The training features include sequence-based features, such as amino acid composition, amino acid property group composition, and dipeptide composition for generating predictive models. The classification of human drug target proteins presents a classic example of class imbalance. We have addressed this issue by using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) as a preprocessing step, for balancing the training data with a ratio of 1:1 between drug targets (minority samples) and non-drug targets (majority samples). Using ensemble classification learning method-Rotation Forest and ReliefF feature-selection technique for selecting the optimal subset of salient features, the best model with selected features can achieve 87.1% sensitivity, 83.6% specificity, and 85.3% accuracy, with 0.71 Matthews correlation coefficient (mcc) on a tenfold stratified cross-validation test. The subset of identified optimal features may help in assessing the compositional patterns in human drug targets. For further validation, using a rigorous leave-one-out cross-validation test, the model achieved 88.1% sensitivity, 83.0% specificity, 85.5% accuracy, and 0.712 mcc. The proposed method was tested on a second dataset, for which the current pipeline gave promising results. We suggest that the present approach can be applied successfully as a complementary tool to existing methods for novel drug target prediction.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Drug targets"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Ensemble learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "SMOTE"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Dipeptide composition"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Property group composition"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "ReliefF"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010482514003254", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482514003254", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84912120607", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84912120607", "pubmed-id": "25437231", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84912120607", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20141120", "$": "2014-11-20"}}}}}
