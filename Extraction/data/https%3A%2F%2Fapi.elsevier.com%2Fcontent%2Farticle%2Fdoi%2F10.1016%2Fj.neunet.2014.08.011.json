It has recently been demonstrated that combining Hebbian learning with occasional alterations of normal neural states avoids this problem by means of self-organized enlargement of the best basins of attraction. However, so far it is not clear to what extent this process of self-optimization is also operative in real brains. Here we demonstrate that it can be transferred to more biologically plausible neural networks by implementing a self-optimizing spiking neural network model. In addition, by using this spiking neural network to emulate a Hopfield network with Hebbian learning, we attempt to make a connection between rate-based and temporal coding based neural systems. Although further work is required to make this model more realistic, it already suggests that the efficacy of the self-optimizing process is independent from the simplifying assumptions of a conventional Hopfield network. We also discuss natural and cultural processes that could be responsible for occasional alteration of neural firing patterns in actual brains.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Self-optimization"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hopfield network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Spiking neurons"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Global neural coordination"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Psychedelics"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Altered states of consciousness"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608014002068", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608014002068", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84921362545", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84921362545", "pubmed-id": "25257715", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84921362545", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20140916", "$": "2014-09-16"}}}}}
