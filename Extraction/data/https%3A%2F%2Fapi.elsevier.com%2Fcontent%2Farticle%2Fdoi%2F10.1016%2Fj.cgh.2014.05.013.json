With the creation of large databases and the trajectory of health care reform, NLP holds the promise of enhancing the availability, quality, and utility of clinical information with the goal of improving documentation, quality, and efficiency of health care in the United States. To date, NLP has shown promise in automatically determining appropriate colonoscopy intervals and identifying cases of inflammatory bowel disease from electronic health records. The objectives of this review are to provide background on NLP and its associated terminology, to describe how NLP has been used thus far in the field of digestive diseases, and to identify its potential future uses.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Natural Language Processing"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Colonoscopy"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Adenoma Detection Rate"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Inflammatory Bowel Disease"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Clinical Decision Support"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Performance Measures"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Quality Improvement"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1542356514007514", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1542356514007514", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84904346100", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84904346100", "pubmed-id": "24858706", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84904346100", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20140521", "$": "2014-05-21"}}}}}
