Abstract To microarray expression data analysis, it is well accepted that biological knowledge-guided clustering techniques show more advantages than pure mathematical techniques. In this paper, Gene Ontology is introduced to guide the clustering process, and thus a new algorithm capturing both expression pattern similarities and biological function similarities is developed. Our algorithm was validated on two well-known public data sets and the results were compared with some previous works. It is shown that our method has advantages in both the quality of clusters and the precision of biological annotations. Furthermore, the clustering results can be adjusted according to different stringency requirements. It is expected that our algorithm can be extended to other biological knowledge, for example, metabolic networks. Keywords Expression data Gene ontology Clustering 1 Introduction DNA microarray technology permits parallel monitoring and large-scale screening of many genes simultaneously in the expression levels [1,2]. Analysis of microarray expression data is becoming one of the major bottlenecks in the utilization of this technology [3]. Among these analyses, clustering has been widely recognized as a useful data-mining tool for discovering similar patterns in expression dataset, which may lead to the insight of significant connections in gene regulatory networks. So far, many traditional mathematical clustering methods have been applied in the context of clustering microarray expression data [4\u201311]. In these pure mathematical methods, genes are always clustered into disjoint groups, which cannot capture the biological fact that many gene products participate in more than one biological process [12]. Recently, some advanced mathematical algorithms, such as subspace clustering algorithms [13\u201316], were published, that may capture the coherence in a subset of genes and a subset of conditions. However, all of these algorithms only pay attention to mathematical similarity of genes and conditions, while the biological meaning of clusters is still neglected. To overcome the above problem, biological knowledge is introduced in expression data analysis. The biological knowledge can be obtained from either scientific literatures or public databases, for example, gene functional annotation [17], MEDLINE database [18], metabolic networks [19], etc. Among them, gene ontology (GO), a large hierarchical vocabulary describing gene product functions in an organism-independent fashion, has been adopted by many recent researches [20,21]. Hvidsten et al. [22] published a systematic supervised learning approach to predict biological process. Liu et al. [20] also presented a novel technique by incorporating GO information into biclustering process. More than these, a large number of programs have been developed to perform the statistical determination, interpretation and visualization of function profiles based on gene ontology, such as GOMiner [23], GOTree Machine [24], FunSpec [17], Onto-Tools [25], and GO::TermFinder [26]. All these methods and programs mainly focus on using knowledge of GO to evaluate or interpret clustering results, rather than attempting to improve clustering itself. Recently, a co-clustering method, where GO is combined, was reported by Cheng et al. [27]. In Cheng\u2019s method, the GO term similarity and expression similarity are integrated together as similarity measurement in clustering, and thus the clusters get more stable and biologically meaningful. Different from Cheng\u2019s method, in this paper, we present a novel clustering algorithm, in which the expression profile is mapped to the modified structure of GO (GO tree). After that, the clustering process is based on the GO tree. In the following sections, our method is demonstrated in details. In Section 2, the clustering algorithm is illustrated. In Sections 3 and 4, the results of our method on two real-world datasets [4] and some comparison with those of other published methods are presented. Finally, in Section 5, our method is discussed, and thus some conclusions are drawn. The paper ends with perspectives for other potential applications and suggestions for further improvements. 2 Methods In our method, GO is introduced to guide the clustering of microarray gene expression dataset. There, firstly, a GO tree is constructed from GO data file. Subsequently, genes involved in the expression dataset are mapped to this GO tree via species related database, and unmapped nodes (terms) in GO tree are excluded. Thereafter, every node in this GO tree is checked from top to bottom. Genes mapped to a node and its descendant nodes form an initial cluster, and its expression similarity is calculated. If high expression similarity is obtained, the cluster is output, and the node and its descendant nodes are excluded from GO tree. Otherwise, no action is taken. After traversing the whole GO tree once, the algorithm produces a set of clusters. Refined by average trend constraint filtering, clusters with both high expression similarities and high function similarities are obtained. In the following sections our method is illustrated in details. 2.1 Construction of hierarchical tree using GO information The gene ontology is a controlled vocabulary that can be applied to all organisms [28]. There are three categories in GO, namely molecular function, biological process and cellular component. Experimental studies show that among these three categories of GO, biological process agrees best with the hypothesis that similar expressions indicate a functional relation [29]. So we chose the category of biological process as our GO knowledge mapping base. GO hierarchy is originally described as a direct acyclic graph (DAG). For convenience, a flat file format GO is parsed and transformed into an ordered tree, a directed tree with an order defined for the children of every internal node of the tree, via the method of Lee et al. [30] As we know, a GO term may have more than one parent, that is, a GO term may have multiple paths from the root. To build an ordered tree, the occurrences of a same GO term in different paths are considered separately. The resulting graph is an ordered tree having GO terms as its nodes and the term \u2018biological_process\u2019 as its root. The information stored in each node includes: term name, term identifier and relationship with its parent term. According to Lee\u2019s definition [30], a node is considered at level N of GO tree, N =1,2,\u2026, H (H is the height of GO tree), if the depth of the node is N-1. For two GO nodes A and B such that (level of A)= m and (level of B)= n with m < n, we say that B is on a deeper level than A, or the level of B is greater than that of A. The sketch map of GO tree is shown in Fig. 1 . After the GO tree is generated, all the following procedures will be based on the GO tree structure. 2.2 Mapping interested genes to GO tree Only a part of the above GO tree, which consists of GO terms corresponding to genes in the to-be-clustered expression dataset, is interested. The GO term related to each gene in expression dataset can be obtained by searching the relevant database, for example, Saccharomyces Genome Database for yeast genes (http://www.yeastgenome.org/). All these obtained GO terms will be marked in the GO tree structure generated in Section 2.1. If one gene has more than one corresponding GO terms, all of them are marked. During clustering, only nodes that are marked will be considered, while all other nodes are neglected. The mapping relationship between genes and GO terms is recorded, so that, in the following steps, the groups of GO terms can be inverse-mapped into gene clusters. 2.3 Clustering of genes For a gene expression matrix (dataset), where each row represents a gene while each column represents a condition, we introduce mean squared residue score [15] to assess the expression correlation of a set of genes within a particular cluster. In reference [15], a cluster may consist of a subset of conditions, however, in our work, all conditions are considered during the clustering process. Therefore, the mean squared residue score of a cluster is redefined as following. Definition 1 Given expression matrix (G, C), where G is the set of genes and C is the set of conditions, for a subset of genes I \u2282 G, the mean squared residue score (msrs) of the submatrix specified by (I, C) is defined as following: (1) H ( I , C ) = 1 I C \u2211 i \u2208 I , j \u2208 C a ij - a iC - a Ij + a IC 2 , where a ij is the element of the expression matrix, and (2) a iC = 1 C \u2211 j \u2208 C a ij , a Ij = 1 I \u2211 i \u2208 I a ij , (3) a IC = 1 I C \u2211 i \u2208 I , j \u2208 C a ij = 1 I \u2211 i \u2208 I a iC = 1 C \u2211 j \u2208 C a Ij . Here a iC is the average expression level of gene i across all conditions while a Ij is the average expression of condition j for all genes in I. In addition, a IC is the average expression of all genes in I across all conditions in C. This score captures the fluctuation level of gene expression data within a cluster. Low score indicates strong coherence in the cluster, for example, msrs =0 means that the gene expression levels fluctuate in unison. The users can set an appropriate threshold \u03b4 of msrs to qualify the cluster. If the msrs of a cluster is below \u03b4, the cluster will be considered as qualified. Otherwise, the patterns in this cluster are considered not coherent as well as we expected. For a given \u03b4, our clustering algorithm proceeds as follows. For every level of the GO tree, we start from the leftmost node of this level. For instance, in Fig. 1, we choose the node corresponding to G9 in level 2 (only nodes mapped with genes will be considered in our process). If the node is marked with \u2018clustered,\u2019 we then go to the next node in the same level. Otherwise, all its descendant nodes will be selected, for example, nodes corresponding to G4 and G5 for the descendant nodes of G9. Assuming that the set of genes which are mapped to these descendant nodes and the node itself is I, we denote the expression profiles of genes I as a matrix, B, specified by (I, C). In this example, I represents the set (G9, G4, G5). Thereafter, we calculate the msrs value of B and compare it with \u03b4. If the msrs value is below \u03b4, this cluster will be output; subsequently, the algorithm goes to the next node in this level. All nodes contributing to this cluster will be marked with \u2018clustered.\u2019 Otherwise, no change of the marking in the tree will be made and we go to the next node in this level directly. In this example, the node corresponding to G10 is the only marked node of level 2. Thus we go to the nodes in level 3. This process repeats for all nodes in the level and then goes to the next level. The iteration terminates when every level of the GO tree has been visited. The detailed algorithm is listed as following: ALGORITHM: cluster_tree(H, TR, EM) INPUT: H: GO tree TR: Threshold EM: Expression matrix OUTPUT: Gene clusters FOR i =1 to max level of H DO FOR j =1 to max node index of level i DO IF the node j is clustered, continue ELSE Find all descendant nodes of j on H, with their corresponding gene set G. Find all genes corresponding to node j, calculate its union with G, obtain the gene set I Select the expression profiles of genes in I from EM and thus build a sub-matrix B Calculate the msrs value MSRS of B IF MSRS > TR, continue ELSE output a cluster including all genes in set of I, and mark the node j and its descendant nodes with \u2018clustered\u2019 END IF END IF END FOR END FOR 2.4 Average trend constraint filtering Although msrs is used to ensure the coherence of a cluster, there are still some exceptional cases. For instance, let us assume that there is a cluster containing 20 genes. Two of these 20 genes do not have the similar fluctuation of gene expressions with others, while the expression patterns of the rest genes are very similar. In this case, the msrs value may be less than the threshold, because the inconsonance brought by two genes is not so sufficient to influence the coherence of the cluster. This kind of case is not what we want. Thus, the average trend constraint filtering is devised to remove the genes whose expressions are aberrant to the average trend of the cluster. The trend means the increase or the decrease of gene expression levels between two conditions. The average trend means the predominant trend between two conditions of all genes in the cluster. For example, given a cluster consisting of genes {G1, G2,\u2026,G20} and conditions C1 and C2, if 12 of these 20 genes increase their expression level from C1 to C2 and 5 of them decrease and 3 of them remain un-change, the average trend of the cluster between C1 and C2 is \u201cup.\u201d To a cluster output from the above clustering algorithm, we calculate the average trend for each adjacent pair of conditions and thus produce an average trend vector. Subsequently, after a threshold for the maximum tolerable number of inconsistent trends is defined, the trend vector of each gene in the cluster is compared with the average trend vector. If the difference between a gene\u2019s trend vector and the average trend vector exceed the threshold, the gene will be removed from the cluster. 3 Experimental methods 3.1 Data preparation To validate our algorithm, the well-known data set by Eisen et al. [4] was adopted. There, gene expression in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was studied during the diauxic shift, the mitotic cell division cycle, sporulation, and temperature and reducing shocks by using microarrays containing essentially every ORF from this fully sequenced organism. Each cell in the expression matrix represents the measured Cy5/Cy3 fluorescence ratio at the corresponding target element on the appropriate array. All ratio values were log transformed (base 2 for simplicity) to treat inductions or repressions of identical magnitude as numerically equal but with opposite sign. Using the hierarchical clustering methods, Eisen et al. [4] successfully clustered the gene expression profiles. We investigated the genes of Fig. 2 in Eisen et al., which can be accessed from http://genome-www.stanford.edu/clustering/. There are 2467 genes and 79 conditions. Values for missing data (1.9% of the data) were replaced with 0. The Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) downloaded from http://www.geneontology.org/ was used to extract GO term [31]. We used the SGD (Revision 1.923) and the GO (Revision 3.71) in our experiments. Only biological process of GO was discussed. Since there are too many genes in expression matrixes and some of them do not show any significant fluctuation across different conditions, in this experiment, we selected genes whose expression profiles show significant variation among all conditions and removed those without significant fluctuations. Particularly, we chose genes whose expression profiles contain at least one value out of the range of [\u22121,1]. The range can be adjusted according to users\u2019 preference. 3.2 Determination of parameter To obtain appropriate threshold value \u03b4, we calculated the msrs values for each GO term corresponding to the genes in the input data set. Table 1 is a segment of this example result. From it, one can choose an appropriate threshold value based on his requirement. For example, if one needs to see a cluster derived from a particular GO term, he can find the msrs value of this term and set a threshold \u03b4 a little larger than the msrs value. In addition, we listed the level number of each GO term; therefore, user can determine the \u03b4 value by skimming to the msrs values of the terms on the wanted level. The threshold in average trend constraint filtering is usually set as 30\u201340% of the condition numbers. Low threshold leads to consistent but small clusters. We used 30 as the maximum number of the tolerable incorrect trends. 3.3 Evaluation criteria To assess the reliability of our result clusters with GO, a function WR is defined to evaluate the coherence of annotation. For a cluster C whose annotation space is A, we suppose a is the most frequently occurred annotation in A. (4) WR = 1 - cor _ num whl _ num , where cor_num is the number of genes annotated by a and whl_num is the total number of genes in C. Obviously, WR can measure the inconsistency of annotations in a cluster. Smaller WR implies stronger coherence. 3.4 Implementation Our algorithm was implemented in C++. With the parameters specified above, clusters were discovered in less than 1min using a PC with a 2.4GHz CPU under Windows environment with 512MB RAM. The source code of the program and the example data sets are available at http://titan.biotec.uiuc.edu/clustering/. 4 Results Our algorithm was tested using the dataset prepared in Section 3.1. Setting 0.21 to \u03b4, we obtained 510 clusters. After the average trend constraint filtering, 423 clusters remained. For each cluster, we used a GO term as the annotation to describe the biological function of the cluster. The profiles of some clusters are shown in Fig. 2. Some of their parameters are shown in Table 2 . It has been pointed out in previous section that one gene may be mapped to more than one GO terms, and these terms will be considered as separate nodes on the GO tree in our algorithm. According to this phenomenon, we permit the existence of overlapping clusters, that is, one gene may appear in several clusters. For instance, gene YAL016W belongs to cluster 14, cluster 153, cluster 165, cluster 369, and cluster 454. The biological terms of each cluster are bud growth (cluster 14), dephosphorylation (cluster 153), protein amino acid dephosphorylation (cluster 165), cell cycle checkpoint (cluster 369) and mitotic checkpoint (cluster 454). This means that gene YAL016W participates in all these processes. There are 810 genes in our experiment that were assigned to multiple clusters. In following Section 4.1, we compare our clusters with those from Eisen\u2019s published method. It is shown that our method can get better result with the GO structure introduced and referred. Moreover, we also compare our annotation with a recent result published by Lee, who used GO to interpret the result of Eisen\u2019s clustering. The comparison given in Section 4.2 demonstrates that our annotations are more detailed. Besides, in Section 4.3, we discuss the dependence of thresholds versus meaningful clusters, also with some statistical value given. 4.1 Comparison of clustering results We compared our results with that from Eisen\u2019s hierarchical clustering methods. There were many overlaps between our clusters and Eisen\u2019s clusters. Table 3 shows two examples. Our cluster 75 contains 8 of the 15 genes of Eisen\u2019s cluster 6. From the keywords of Eisen one can see that all these 8 genes are about ATP synthesis, while 6 of the remainder 7 genes are not annotated with ATP synthesis. In addition, four genes (YPL271W, YBR039W, YDL130W, and YGR008C) that were not included in Eisen\u2019s cluster 6, are included in our cluster and annotated as ATP synthesis. The similar phenomenon appears in Eisen\u2019s cluster 2 and our cluster 335. Twenty-four out of 27 genes in Eisen\u2019s cluster 2 are found in our cluster. Our cluster 335 includes 5 more genes that are annotated as Protein degradation, which are the main keywords of Eisen\u2019s cluster 2.The profiles of these clusters are shown in Fig. 3 . Table 4 shows the comparison of WR values between Eisen\u2019s clusters and ours. It can be seen that our results are much better than Eisens\u2019 in the aspect of coherence of annotation. To further validate our method, we applied our method to another data set, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle data set of Cho et al. [32], which captures 6220 mRNA species in synchronized S. cerevisiae batch cultures through 17 time points. Tavazoie et al. [33] clustered the most variable 3000 ORFs into 30 clusters using k-means algorithm. We used the genes with identified SGD ORF names and selected 5000 as \u03b4 based on the range of the data set. 574 clusters were obtained and 513 clusters remained after average trend constraint filtering. The WR values from our clusters and Tavazoie\u2019s clusters are listed in Table 5 . It indicates that the clusters we obtained are more coherent. 4.2 Comparison of annotation We compare our results with Lee\u2019s [30] to demonstrate how the introducing of GO can lead to proper interpretations of clusters. Lee et al. utilized a graph algorithm to extract common biological attributes of the genes within a cluster based the GO hierarchy. They annotated the top 10 clusters of Eisen et al. [30] and obtained the representative biological meanings of each clusters by AverPd. Lee claimed that the clusters except 2, 7, and 9 had inconsistent functional contexts. The results are listed in Table 6 . There are three observations. (1) Some of Eisen\u2019s clusters are highly overlapped with our clusters, such as cluster 2 and 9. For these clusters, our annotation is the same as the Lee\u2019s annotation. (2) Some of our clusters are the sub-clusters of Eisens\u2019, for example, cluster 1 and 7, and thus the associated annotations are also the child terms of Lee\u2019s annotations. (3) There are some Eisen clusters, which are partitioned into a set of clusters in our results. For example, Eisen clusters 5 and 8 are annotated as \u2018protein biosynthesis\u2019 by Lee et al., while our method divided them into 12 clusters. The GO term of these sub-clusters are 1\u20134 levels deeper than \u2018protein biosynthesis,\u2019 respectively, and all have msrs values smaller than 0.281309. Due to the fact that the term \u2018mRNA splicing\u2019 is obsolete, the annotation of cluster 3 is changed to \u2018mRNA processing.\u2019 The above results demonstrate that our algorithm produced more specific annotation while compared with Lee\u2019s method. 4.3 Dependence of threshold versus meaningful clusters As described in Section 2.1, the nodes on GO tree are labeled with different levels, and the nodes in deeper levels have more biologically meaning [34]. In this sense, the clusters with interpretations of deeper GO terms are expected to contain more accurate biological information and be more significant in future analysis. So, we investigate the relationship between msrs thresholds and annotation results. With the dataset mentioned in Section 3.1, the distributions of clusters over different GO tree levels for various thresholds are given in Fig. 4 . It is shown that, for smaller threshold, the distribution is moved to deeper GO tree level, which means more specific annotation. The average levels of thresholds 0.15, 0.21, 0.25, and 0.3 are 7.37, 6.88, 6.66, and 6.19, respectively. We conclude that smaller threshold can lead to more specific clusters. Since there is a tradeoff between cluster size and its annotation level, we have to choose appropriate threshold to obtain reasonable size of clusters. In this sense, there is a tradeoff between the cluster size and annotation precision as well. 5 Discussion There are many clustering methods for analysis of microarray expression data. Most of them are based on the similarity of the expression patterns. To further extract the biological meaning from clusters, some other algorithms and programs are developed to character clusters with GO terms [35,36,24]. Usually, these programs use statistical tests or topological properties to assess the quality of clustering results. In most of the cases, it is hard to interpret the clustering results, because some genes in the same cluster might have no biological similarity at all. Our method tries to overcome this problem via combining gene expression similarity with function similarity. Gene Ontology is introduced as the prior function knowledge. Therefore, several advantages are obtained. First, our clusters items are based on a similarity measure that depends on both expression profiles and biological functions, which are equally essential for gene clusters. These two are inseparable and exchangeable. It is the main difference between our method and others, where annotating is after clustering. As we know, generally, in microarray expression data analysis, clustering and annotation are undertaken separately, annotation after clustering. It is of high possibility that genes with dissimilar functions are clustered into one cluster because of their high expression similarity. This situation is what biologists are trying to obviate. In our clustering method, GO is referred amid clustering, therefore, to a cluster, the function similarity is guaranteed before expression similarity is obtained. Obviously, our clustering method will produce clusters with high similarities of both expression and function. As we have seen in the above experimental results, our clustering method brought higher coherent clusters with specific biological meanings at the same time. Moreover, as clustering and annotation are undertaken at one time, the user\u2019s operation is facilitated. Second, the similarity function used in our clustering (msrs) depends on a context, which is best defined as a subset of the attributes. Compared to the commonly used methods, for example, Euclidean distance and Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient, msrs can valuate the fluctuation coherence among multi-genes while the other two can only measure the distance between two genes (Euclidean distance) or the similarity of expression patterns between two genes (Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient). Therefore, it shows more reasonability of msrs to get correlative gene sets. Third, our method allows genes to be included in multiple clusters, and thus allow one gene to be associated with more than one function categories. That is consistent with the well-known fact that many gene products participate in more than one biological process. Obviously, it reflects the reality in the functionality of genes. Our method can be applied in several usages. First, given a microarray dataset and a biological function, it can be used to find out the corresponding cluster of genes. We find the corresponding GO term by given function, and then obtain the msrs value of this term. Thereafter, the desired cluster can be calculated by setting the threshold a little larger than the msrs values. Second, it can satisfy the requirement of different annotation stringencies. If we want to get clusters whose annotation GO terms are below level n in the GO tree, we can find all the msrs values of terms at level n and set a threshold equal to the minimum value of them. The results will be clusters with more precise terms than level n. Moreover, our algorithm can be easily generalized. In this paper, we have already used GO to demonstrate how a particular biological knowledge is integrated in analysis of microarray data. It can be imagined that, other biological knowledge, for example, pathways, can be used instead to create the initial cluster. In this sense, this methodology may be further applied to any kinds of analysis on other biological entities. At the end, it should be pointed out that there are some improvements needed in further researches. For example, for genes corresponding to high level GO terms, the msrs values are quite big. As a result, these genes will not be included in any clusters. Besides, our method depends strongly on the accurateness and completeness of the GO hierarchy. It can be expected that if the quality of GO get improved with more updates and knowledge accumulation, our method will bring better result. References [1] J.J. Chen R. Wu P.C. Yang J.Y. Huang Y.P.
