In this study we introduce a novel approach, the so-called \u201cphysics and chemistry-driven artificial neural network (Phys\u2013Chem ANN)\u201d, to deal with such a problem. Unlike the existing ANN approaches, which were designed under the inspiration of biological neural system, the Phys\u2013Chem ANN approach is based on the physical and chemical principles, as well as the structural features of proteins. In the Phys\u2013Chem ANN model the \u201chidden layers\u201d are no longer virtual \u201cneurons\u201d, but real structural units of proteins and peptides. It is a hybridization approach, which combines the linear free energy concept of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) with the advanced mathematical technique of ANN. The Phys\u2013Chem ANN approach has adopted an iterative and feedback procedure, incorporating both machine-learning and artificial intelligence capabilities. In addition to making more accurate predictions for the bioactivities of proteins and peptides than is possible with the traditional QSAR approach, the Phys\u2013Chem ANN approach can also provide more insights about the relationship between bioactivities and the structures involved than the ANN approach does. As an example of the application of the Phys\u2013Chem ANN approach, a predictive model for the conformational stability of human lysozyme is presented.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Bioactivity prediction"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Amino acids"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Human lysozyme"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "ANN"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "QSAR"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519308004505", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519308004505", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "58149131271", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-58149131271", "pubmed-id": "18835398", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/58149131271", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20080917", "$": "2008-09-17"}}}}}
