The former case is based on a modification of the Hebbian prescription, which induces a coupling between consecutive patterns and this effect is tuned by a parameter \n                        a\n                     . In the latter case, dilution is introduced in pattern entries, in such a way that a fraction \n                        d\n                      of them is blank. Then, we merge these two extensions to obtain a system able to retrieve several patterns in parallel and the quality of retrieval, encoded by the set of Mattis magnetizations \n                        \n                           {\n                           \n                              \n                                 m\n                              \n                              \n                                 \u03bc\n                              \n                           \n                           }\n                        \n                     , is reminiscent of the correlation among patterns. By tuning the parameters \n                        d\n                      and \n                        a\n                     , qualitatively different outputs emerge, ranging from highly hierarchical to symmetric. The investigations are accomplished by means of both numerical simulations and statistical mechanics analysis, properly adapting a novel technique originally developed for spin glasses, i.e.\u00a0the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi interpolation, with excellent agreement. Finally, we show the thermodynamical equivalence of this associative network with a (restricted) Boltzmann machine and study its stochastic dynamics to obtain even a dynamical picture, perfectly consistent with the static scenario earlier discussed.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Neural networks"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Boltzmann machines"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Pattern retrieval"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Multitasking networks"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Correlated patterns"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608012003073", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608012003073", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84870784030", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84870784030", "pubmed-id": "23246601", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84870784030", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20121127", "$": "2012-11-27"}}}}}
