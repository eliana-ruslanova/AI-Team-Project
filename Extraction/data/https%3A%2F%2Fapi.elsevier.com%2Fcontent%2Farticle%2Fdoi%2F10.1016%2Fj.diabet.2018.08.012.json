Moreover, data generated online and by digital technologies \u2013\u2009which the authors suggest be grouped under the term \u2018digitosome\u2019\u2009\u2013 constitute, through the quantity and variety of information they represent, a powerful potential for identifying new digital markers and patterns of risk that, ultimately, when combined with clinical data, can improve diabetes management and quality of life, and also prevent diabetes-related complications. Moving from a world in which patients are characterized by only a few recent measurements of fasting glucose levels and glycated haemoglobin to a world where patients, healthcare professionals and research scientists can consider various key parameters at thousands of time points simultaneously will profoundly change the way diabetes is prevented, managed and characterized in patients living with diabetes, as well as how it is scientifically researched. Indeed, the present review looks at how the digitization of diabetes can impact all fields of diabetes \u2013\u2009its prevention, management, technology and research\u2009\u2013 and how it can complement, but not replace, what is usually done in traditional clinical settings. Such a profound shift is a genuine game changer that should be embraced by all, as it can provide solid research results transferable to patients, improve general health literacy, and provide tools to facilitate the everyday decision-making process by both healthcare professionals and patients living with diabetes.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial intelligence"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Big data"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Social media"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Technology"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Diabetes"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S126236361830171X", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S126236361830171X", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85054594100", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85054594100", "pubmed-id": "30243616", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054594100", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20180919", "$": "2018-09-19"}}}}}
