Key Words Artificial intelligence machine learning blockchain 3-D printing Introduction The medical device industry is undergoing rapid change as innovation accelerates, new business models emerge, and artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things create disruptive possibilities in health care. On the innovation front, global annual patent applications related to medical devices have tripled in 10 years, and technology cycle times have halved in just 5 years. Connectivity has exploded\u2014by 2021, the world will have more than three times as many smart connected devices as people\u2014and more and more medical devices and processes contain integrated sensors. Companies such as Apple (Cupertino, California), Google (Menlo Park, California), Amazon (Seattle, Washington), and Facebook (Menlo Park, California) are deploying connected technologies in business models that did not even exist a decade ago, disrupting consumer and enterprise industries in the process. Though they have yet to disrupt health care, they give medical device companies an urgent reason to claim their place at the forefront of innovation. Broadly speaking, medical imaging has benefited from these trends more than other parts of the device industry. That is partly because it generates large digitized data sets that can be subjected to advanced analytics and deep learning. A second reason is that it comprises a full technology stack from hardware to intelligent software, offering ample scope for innovation. Third, improving workflows and the accuracy and speed of diagnostics can deliver measurable benefits in better patient care, reductions in costs and variability, and greater satisfaction for radiologists. In this article, we report on recent McKinsey (McKinsey & Company, New York, New York) work to map start-ups in the imaging industry. We identify technology clusters with good prospects of future growth, look at some of their cutting-edge practices, and consider what the implications may be for today\u2019s medical device companies. How We Analyzed the Imaging Landscape We set out to answer a series of questions: \u25a0 What clusters of technology innovation are emerging in venture capital and start-ups? \u25a0 How have these clusters evolved over the past few years, and which offer the best prospects for future growth? \u25a0 What is the next innovation S-curve for medical imaging, and how can today\u2019s companies adapt? To answer these questions, we scanned the global start-up landscape for new and emerging technologies using our proprietary Startup and Investment Landscape Analytics tool (Fig. 1 ). From a company search using a range of imaging-related key words, we initially identified 236 companies working on technologies that could be applied to data acquisition, visualization, interpretation, storage, and sharing in medical imaging. Having eliminated companies that were no longer operating or did not meet our criteria for relevance, we were left with a total of 146 start-ups working with new technologies relevant to medical imaging. We grouped companies into technology clusters and analyzed the age and investment history of each technology, the number of start-ups in each cluster, and their age, revenues, and profitability. Over the past 5 years, these companies received a total of more than $1.8 billion in investments in 446 separate transactions. Figure 2 shows how the 146 companies can be clustered by specialty. We grouped the 11 clusters that emerged into 4 mega clusters: (1) AI and machine learning (ML) paradigm shift; (2) cloud-based and blockchain distributed and secure technologies; (3) improved visualization from better imaging in real time; and (4) incremental innovation. The Technologies That Matter for Medical Imaging Our research identified start-ups operating in 11 specialist fields relevant to medical imaging. Figure 3 provides a detailed analysis of these companies, organized into the four mega clusters described previously. AI and ML: Shifting the Paradigm This cluster, the most recent to have emerged among those we mapped, also has the highest volume of transactions and represents 22% of the companies included in the analysis. It has the potential to transform the way health care is conducted, with AI and ML solutions complementing the work of physicians to enable the development of new treatment paradigms. One example is Viz.ai (San Francisco, California), which uses AI to detect stroke in CT scans. If a scan shows signs of large-vessel occlusion stroke, it is sent to the front of the radiologist\u2019s queue, and the stroke team is alerted. This enables the patient to be treated promptly during the narrow window for therapy, improving outcomes for those affected by one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Cloud-Based and Blockchain: \u201cDemocratizing\u201d Imaging via Secure Distributed Technologies This cluster provides imaging solutions that are easier, cheaper, and more secure to store, making them more accessible to patients, providers, and researchers. It is also part of a broader shift away from providers toward patients as the latter demand more access to their data. Essentially this technology can ease the transfer of medical information between facilities and to patients. Within this cluster, blockchain is the area with the fastest growth and is worth watching because the secure distributed storage of medical data outside medical institutions is a precondition for enabling patients to have access to and control of their data. Blockchain can also be used as a conduit for AI and ML analysis and shared graphics processing. Improved Visualization Technologies: Better Imaging in Real Time This cluster, comprising slightly older companies (in terms of average year founded) than the previous cluster, consists of 3-D, virtual reality, and nuclear and hybrid imaging modalities, along with intra-operative technologies. Together, these technologies allow physicians to \u201csee\u201d the patient in new ways, with greater precision that supports more effective treatments and better clinical outcomes. An example is Brainlab (Munich, Germany), which allows neurosurgeons to navigate the intracranial operative field by mapping real-time surgical instrument guidance to the patient\u2019s prior MRI scan. This cluster of companies has the greatest number of transactions per company, large transaction values, and several revenue-generating companies. It sits at the center of innovation in our cluster map and draws on a range of adjacent technologies, such as AI and ML, cloud, portable, and traditional software and hardware offerings. Incremental Innovation: Faster Data Acquisition, Clinical Decision Support, 3-D Printing, Portable Imaging, and Telemedicine This cluster, located at the edges of our cluster map, consists of technologies that have brought incremental innovation in software or hardware. High expectations for these technologies have not translated into commensurate transaction volumes or revenues, because the companies involved mostly provide point solutions rather than integrated offerings. For example, portable equipment makes imaging more accessible to patients, especially in rural or underserved communities, and 3-D printing, coupled with imaging analysis, improves patient education and enables physicians to visualize complex anatomy before surgery. However, these solutions have not yet garnered widespread adoption or changed the imaging landscape in any fundamental way. Spotlight on Trends Shaping the Future of Imaging Next, we look in depth at two of the most promising technology clusters, AI and ML and blockchain, and at established technologies that are still evolving and gaining momentum. Hot Market Trend 1: AI and ML Start-ups are emerging rapidly in these technologies, with most of those in our analysis having been established in the past 5 years. This cluster has the greatest number of start-ups (32), the highest volume of investor transactions (more than $500 million), the greatest revenue, and strong investor interest and potential for further growth. Furthermore, there has been keen interest from radiologists in improving work efficiency, given the number of specialty-specific publications, presentations, and opinion articles in this space. Companies that focus on AI and ML use the wealth of data provided by imaging to train algorithms to read scans and report on the findings. In the first innovation wave, AI and ML will categorize or flag scans to speed up processing and, where needed, referrals to specialists. The technology has multiple possibilities for future applications in radiology, from supporting more complex imaging protocols to mining data for new disease markers. Most of the companies operating in this area specialize in a particular imaging modality that generates large data sets on specific parts of the body. According to our scan, 22% of companies focused on CT, 13% each on mammography and MRI, 9% on ultrasound, and 3% each on nuclear imaging and x-rays. The remaining 31% of companies did not specify a modality. CT and mammography lend themselves most readily to AI because attenuation information can be used in the learning algorithms. Other modalities present challenges: the interpretation of multisequence images in MRI, the user variability in ultrasound, and 2-D limitations in x-rays. The majority of AI companies we scanned (72%) develop technologies that use deep-learning algorithms to identify image lesions or abnormalities. Other offerings include electronic medical record integration for auto-population of measurements and comparisons (12%), workflow management to prioritize scans with expected abnormalities (9%), and the use of reported findings to improve decision making (6%). Companies that use AI to manage workflow have the greatest number of reported investors (more than four per company) and have raised the most funding (more than $17 million), reflecting the importance of integrating AI into operating processes to realize efficiency gains. AI can also reduce interpretation time for radiologists; studies have shown that using AI achieves greater accuracy than trained radiologists alone, as well reducing health care costs [1,2]. Why This Is the Future AI and ML can help radiologists respond to pressures to interpret studies more quickly. The number of scans in a typical radiologist\u2019s workload has increased by as much as 20% to 50% in 5 years [3], and this pressure continues to grow as patient volumes rise and complex cases require more time. Although ML and automation are not expected to advance to the point of replacing radiologists in the next 20 years, they have an important role to play by enabling radiologists to increase their reading efficiency and manage a higher volume of scans, to increase accuracy by prioritizing time on abnormal or complex scans, and to extract more value from images. Moreover, quantitative measurements based on algorithms have been shown in some cases to detect abnormalities not readily visible to the human eye, especially when advanced imaging techniques, such as diffusion or functional imaging, are used. AI and ML also enable better intervention planning based on better data. Another important benefit is the use of predictive analysis to prevent unnecessary re-admissions and further testing, in line with the shift to value-based care. Finally, AI and ML make it possible to integrate imaging data with data from electronic medical records (such as longitudinal patient data) or other population health platforms to provide a rich source of new insights for medical research, such as the identification of new protocols or indications for imaging. Hot Market Trend 2: Blockchain Blockchain or distributed ledger technology is the newest cluster identified in our start-up scan. All companies in the cluster were founded or have developed blockchain capabilities, in the past 5 years. Health-related blockchain companies represent 10% of these start-ups. Fifteen companies had initial coin offerings in health care data analytics, spanning health records, genomic data, and predictive analytics. DeepRadiology (Santa Monica, California) is the first blockchain company dedicated to imaging applications that we have identified. Others are likely to follow, given the growing interest in distributed ledgers and the application of the technology to large data sets across industries. Blockchain has several advantages in medical imaging applications. It could help prevent the kind of data breaches that have recently occurred in health care and, if breaches do occur, blockchain can enable continued functioning after the event. The technology is likely to underpin further use cases for cyber- and data security in concert with data sharing, as well as AI computing through the use of ML algorithms across distributed ledgers. Blockchain will also support the distribution of graphics processing units to drive AI analysis and analytics and facilitate further ML endeavors. Why This Is the Future Medical imaging data are growing exponentially and will need new storage solutions. Estimates indicate that the world\u2019s devices will produce a total of 35 ZB of imaging data by 2020. Much health care innovation depends on improving the secure sharing of such data. In the United States, for instance, the sharing of medical records between hospital systems and states could greatly improve patient care and increase radiologist efficiency by eliminating unnecessary repeat imaging, reducing costs, and enabling clinicians to compare scans over time to determine disease progression or identify benign \u201cincidentalomas\u201d\u2014spurious findings with no clinical significance. By enabling users to store and access data across a distributed ledger, blockchain will facilitate information sharing and support the development of a more integrative approach to medicine. Its use as a data-sharing platform could support innovation in real-time image processing and advances in interpretation, such as the use of ML. Blockchain has already disrupted banking, another industry with large data needs, cross-network sharing, and high levels of cybersecurity. As activity in health care intensifies, medical imaging is ripe for a similar disruption. Other Segments Still Gaining Momentum Our scan of the start-up landscape identified several established technologies that continue to evolve: the improved visualization technologies of 3-D and virtual reality, plus intra-operative, nuclear, and portable imaging. All have seen considerable growth over the past decade and account for almost $700 million of investments in total. 3-D Visualization, Virtual Reality, and Image-Guided Intervention The 19 start-ups involved in 3-D visualization and virtual reality are among the longest-established companies in our scan and attract significant funding activity, with the third-highest transaction value after AI and ML and intra-operative technologies. Demand for 3-D printing is increasing in applications such as anatomical models that help with surgical planning (from Materialise, Leuven, Belgium) and surgical simulation platforms that device sales representatives can use to coach surgeons (from ImmersiveTouch, Chicago, Illinois). The technology has also been deployed to make accurate surgical prosthetics, such as middle-ear prosthetics, that improve the accuracy of surgical intervention for patients with conductive hearing loss. When coupled with newer trends in 3-D printing or integrated into virtual-reality visualization, 3-D visualization helps improve clinicians\u2019 understanding of anatomy. A couple of examples serve to illustrate how. With interactive 3-D visualization platforms, surgeons and interventional radiologists will no longer have to rely on 2-D images from a scan when they make incisions, operate, or perform other interventions. Instead, they will be able to see preprocedural 3-D images overlaid on the patient\u2019s body as they operate. New tools that enable clinicians to visualize in three dimensions include advanced monitors for the surgical suite and augmented-reality glasses that allow users to see and manipulate a screen or holograms with hand gestures. These technologies can enhance pre-operative and procedural planning, enable greater accuracy in biopsies, and act as a valuable teaching tool in surgery and other interventions. Intra-operative Technologies The 11 start-ups focused on intra-operative technologies have a median founding year of 2010 and have attracted $365 million in investment over the past 5 years. Imaging is becoming a crucial aspect of intra-operative planning and execution, particularly for applications requiring extensive data acquisition in real time. It can enhance precision during surgical interventions and improve outcomes. Intra-operative techniques span all modalities, including ultrasound, MRI, and fluoroscopy, and they often require portable capabilities. The implications for imaging companies are that they will need to expand their intra-operative capabilities, create intra-operative equipment compatible with different imaging equipment (or imaging equipment compatible with the procedural environment), and develop accessories, such as navigation equipment and a stylus, for data interaction in a sterile field. With real-time, image-guided adaptive radiotherapy, clinicians can improve the targeting and effectiveness of radiotherapy treatment by increasing the dose delivered while minimizing the risk to surrounding tissue. Image-guided adaptive radiotherapy has been around for many years but requires frequent reimaging (typically by CT) of the patient during their course of radiotherapy. The addition of real-time imaging takes the technique to the next level and relies on more data, faster acquisition, and faster image processing. Indications for its use in brain and lung tumors are growing. Future indications will require further improvements in data acquisition and processing and the use of even more advanced imaging techniques, such as functional MRI and PET/MR, along with AI and ML to automate or speed up adoption. Nuclear Imaging The 13 companies in this segment had more than 50 transactions with a median value slightly below $4 million, possibly reflecting the niche nature of markets for the newer nuclear medicine ligands. In nuclear and PET imaging, the introduction of specific ligands allows for better targeting in cancer diagnosis and reduces the need for tissue sampling. Noninvasive diagnostic techniques will play an increasing role in medicine, especially cancer diagnosis and management. And theranostic platforms, in which the nuclear diagnostic agent is paired with a complementary radiotherapeutic, hold promise for meeting unserved needs in oncology. As nuclear imaging grows and moves away from metabolic imaging for cancer localization to pathology-specific cancer diagnosis (for instance, the combining of ligands specific to prostate or breast cancer with radioisotopes for definitive diagnosis), imaging companies will have increasing opportunities to engage in cancer diagnostics, and potentially therapeutics as well. Incremental Innovation Investors are showing less interest in segments that are reaching maturity, where there are fewer (or older) start-ups and fewer transactions. Even so, telemedicine, clinician decision support, cloud applications, portable imaging, and accelerated-acquisition innovations are still areas of interest. In particular, telemedicine is being adopted by a number of provider systems, and offerings for clinical decision support continue to emerge, predominantly from major radiology suppliers. Medical imaging companies and investors have a wide range of options for investing in this rapidly expanding area. To put these options in context, we suggest they consider their aspirations and then ask themselves a few fundamental questions (see following section). Understanding the activities of early-stage start-ups and trends in investment flows can help them identify sources of innovation, disruption, and likely success within a market. And taking a deeper look at promising start-ups and investments can help them target companies for acquisition or partnerships. Key Questions to Ask Before Engaging A good way for companies and investors to start to engage with opportunities in medical imaging is to decide on their level of aspiration and then ask themselves a few basic questions. If We Want to Be at the Forefront Which technologies will be the winners? Which will deliver on their promise and create real value? Which will be adopted? What clinical outcomes evidence is available? What additional evidence do we need and for which indications? How long will it take for these technologies and their competitive landscape to develop? Should we go it alone or look for acquisitions or partnerships? What potential disruptors should we look out for? Are there opportunities to leapfrog developing technologies and be a disruptor ourselves? If We Want to Wait and See Where to Invest Strategically Which emerging or \u201chot\u201d technologies and companies should we be watching? Which technologies and companies would create synergies with our products? When should we act? What should trigger investment: the tipping point in investment trends or maturity in product development? If We Want to Stick With Our Core But Stay Relevant Which technologies could pose a threat to our core offerings? What developments do we need to invest in so that our offerings are compatible with new technologies? What developments do we need to invest in to stay competitive when new technologies come on stream? Take-Home Points \u25a0 AI and ML have the potential to transform the way health care is conducted, with AI and ML solutions complementing the work of physicians to enable the development of new treatment paradigms. \u25a0 Blockchain is the area with the fastest growth and is worth watching because the secure distributed storage of medical data outside medical institutions is a precondition for enabling patients to have access to and control of their data. \u25a0 3-D visualization technologies allow physicians to \u201csee\u201d the patient in new ways, with greater precision that supports more effective treatments and better clinical outcomes.

On the innovation front, global annual patent applications related to medical devices have tripled in 10 years, and technology cycle times have halved in just 5 years. Connectivity has exploded\u2014by 2021, the world will have more than three times as many smart connected devices as people\u2014and more and more medical devices and processes contain integrated sensors. In this article, we report on recent McKinsey (McKinsey & Company, New York, New York) work to map start-ups and trends shaping the future of medical imaging. We identify technology clusters with prospects of future growth, look at some of their cutting-edge practices, and consider what the implications may be for our specialty.", "openArchiveArticle":
