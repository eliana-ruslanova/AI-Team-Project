The KBS consists of rule-based reasoning (RBR), case-based reasoning (CBR) and model-based reasoning (MBR) whereas intelligent computing method (ICM) encompasses genetic algorithm (GA), artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy logic (FL) and others. The combination of methods in KBS such as CBR\u2013RBR, CBR\u2013MBR and RBR\u2013CBR\u2013MBR and the combination of methods in ICM is ANN\u2013GA, fuzzy\u2013ANN, fuzzy\u2013GA and fuzzy\u2013ANN\u2013GA. The combination of methods from KBS to ICM is RBR\u2013ANN, CBR\u2013ANN, RBR\u2013CBR\u2013ANN, fuzzy\u2013RBR, fuzzy\u2013CBR and fuzzy\u2013CBR\u2013ANN. In this paper, we have made a study of different singular and combined methods (185 in number) applicable to medical domain from mid 1970s to 2008. The study is presented in tabular form, showing the methods and its salient features, processes and application areas in medical domain (diagnosis, treatment and planning). It is observed that most of the methods are used in medical diagnosis very few are used for planning and moderate number in treatment. The study and its presentation in this context would be helpful for novice researchers in the area of medical expert system.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "ANN"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "CBR"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "MBR"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "RBR"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "KBS"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "GA"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Fuzzy logic"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Intelligent computing model"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010482508001856", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482508001856", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "60649093460", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-60649093460", "pubmed-id": "19201398", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/60649093460", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20090207", "$": "2009-02-07"}}}}}
