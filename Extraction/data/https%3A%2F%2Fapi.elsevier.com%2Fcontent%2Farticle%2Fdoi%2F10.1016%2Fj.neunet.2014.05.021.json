Here we applied the Hodge\u2013Kodaira decomposition, a topological method, to an evolving neural network model in order to characterize its loop structure. By controlling a learning rule parametrically, we found that a model with an STDP-rule, which tends to form paths coincident with causal firing orders, had the most loops. Furthermore, by counting the number of global loops in the network, we detected the inhomogeneity inside the chaotic region, which is usually considered intractable.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hodge\u2013Kodaira decomposition"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Topology"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Spike-timing-dependent plasticity"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Chaos"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Co-evolving network dynamics"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Phase oscillators"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608014001294", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608014001294", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84921354882", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84921354882", "pubmed-id": "24958507", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84921354882", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20140609", "$": "2014-06-09"}}}}}
