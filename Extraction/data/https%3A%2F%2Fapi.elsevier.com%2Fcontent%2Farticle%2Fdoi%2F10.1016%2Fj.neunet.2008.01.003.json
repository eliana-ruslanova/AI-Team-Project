The algorithm is \u201cgreedy\u201d in the sense that at every iteration, it searches for the best rule to generate. The criteria for the best rule include the number of samples and the size of subspaces that it covers, as well as the number of attributes in the rule. This method is employed for extracting rules from neural networks that have been trained and pruned for solving classification problems. The classification rules are extracted from the neural networks using the standard decompositional approach. Neural networks with one hidden layer are trained and the proposed GRG algorithm is applied to their discretized hidden unit activation values. Our experimental results show that neural network rule extraction with the GRG method produces rule sets that are accurate and concise. Application of GRG directly on three medical data sets with discrete attributes also demonstrates its effectiveness for rule generation.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Neural networks"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Rule generation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Discretization"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Clustering"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Classification"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608008000580", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608008000580", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "51049095878", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-51049095878", "pubmed-id": "18442894", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/51049095878", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20080323", "$": "2008-03-23"}}}}}
