This paper describes the UK ISA field trials taken place between 2004 and 2006 and presents evidence on how drivers\u2019 choice of speed is altered. The ISA system was observed to have a distinctive effect in transforming the speed distribution from a conventional bell shape to an asymmetric distribution biased towards the high speed end. ISA not only diminished excessive speeding, but also led to a reduction in speed variation, prompting a positive implication to accident reduction. The use of an overridable ISA system also provided an opportunity to investigate where drivers would choose to have ISA based on observed behaviour instead of opinion. Evidence shows that ISA tends to be overridden on roads where it was perhaps needed most. Behavioural difference among driver groups also suggests that ISA tends to be overridden by those drivers who in safety terms stand to benefit most from using it, as with other safety systems.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Intelligent Speed Adaptation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Speed"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Compliance"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Gender"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Age"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Intention"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Fleet drivers"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001457510000047", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457510000047", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84861904456", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84861904456", "pubmed-id": "22664662", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84861904456", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20100204", "$": "2010-02-04"}}}}}
