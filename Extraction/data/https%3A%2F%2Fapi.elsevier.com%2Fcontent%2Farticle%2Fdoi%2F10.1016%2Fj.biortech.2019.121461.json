The order of degraded compounds in terms of hemi-cellulosic and lignin-based compounds demonstrated the main oxidation and degradation mechanism of co-combustion of PS and LC. The best prediction (R2\n                      of 99.99%) was obtained by ANN28 model. Operating conditions of 90LC10PS, 425\u202f\u00b0C, and 19\u202f\u00b0C\u202fmin\u22121 were determined by PSO as optimum levels with TG value of 67.5%. Once three-replicated validation experiments were performed under PSO-optimized conditions, mean TG values ware observed as 67.5% with a standard deviation of \u00b10.4%. Consequently, MC was used to identify the stochastic variability and uncertainty associated with ANN models that were derived to predict TG values.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Pine sawdust"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Co-combustion"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial intelligence"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Numeric optimization"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Uncertainty estimation"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960852419306911", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960852419306911", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85065772901", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85065772901", "pubmed-id": "31121444", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065772901", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20190513", "$": "2019-05-13"}}}}}
