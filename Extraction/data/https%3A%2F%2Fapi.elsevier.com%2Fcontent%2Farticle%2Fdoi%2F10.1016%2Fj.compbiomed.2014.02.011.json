This is because interactions among the genes and their products play an important role in many molecular processes. A gene regulatory network can act as a blueprint for the researchers to observe the relationships among genes. Due to its importance, several computational approaches have been proposed to infer gene regulatory networks from gene expression data. In this review, six inference approaches are discussed: Boolean network, probabilistic Boolean network, ordinary differential equation, neural network, Bayesian network, and dynamic Bayesian network. These approaches are discussed in terms of introduction, methodology and recent applications of these approaches in gene regulatory network construction. These approaches are also compared in the discussion section. Furthermore, the strengths and weaknesses of these computational approaches are described.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Gene regulatory network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Computational approaches"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Gene expression data"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Bayesian network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Dynamic Bayesian network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Boolean network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Probabilistic Boolean network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Ordinary differential equation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Neural network"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010482514000420", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482514000420", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84896370627", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84896370627", "pubmed-id": "24637147", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84896370627", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20140224", "$": "2014-02-24"}}}}}
