These findings are reported by studies based on voxel-based-morphometry analysis of structural MRI data, comparing mean gray-matter concentration between groups of BPD patients and healthy controls. On the other hand, mean differences between groups are not informative about the discriminative value of neuroimaging data to predict the group of individual subjects. In this paper, we go beyond mean differences analyses, and explore to what extent individual BPD patients can be differentiated from controls (25 subjects in each group), using a combination of automated-morphometric tools for regional cortical thickness/volumetric estimation and Support Vector Machine classifier. The approach included a feature selection step in order to identify the regions containing most discriminative information. The accuracy of this classifier was evaluated using the leave-one-subject-out procedure. The brain regions indicated as containing relevant information to discriminate groups were the orbitofrontal, rostral anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, middle temporal cortices, among others. These areas, which are distinctively involved in emotional and affect regulation of BPD patients, were the most informative regions to achieve both sensitivity and specificity values of 80% in SVM classification. The findings suggest that this new methodology can add clinical and potential diagnostic value to neuroimaging of psychiatric disorders.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Borderline"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Neuroimaging"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Morphometry"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Classification"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Support Vector Machines"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Biomarker"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022395612001604", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395612001604", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84864393141", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84864393141", "pubmed-id": "22682675", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84864393141", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20120608", "$": "2012-06-08"}}}}}
