Here, an automatic enzyme identifier based on support vector machine (SVM) with feature vectors from protein functional domain composition was built to identify enzymes and further a classifier to classify enzymes into six different classes: oxidoreductase, transferase, hydrolase, lyase, isomerase and ligase. Jackknife cross-validation test was adopted to evaluate the performance of our classifier. The 86.03% success rate achieved for enzyme/non-enzyme identification and 91.32% for enzyme classification, which is much better than that of the BLAST and PSI-BLAST based method, also outperforms several existed works. The results indicate that protein functional domain composition is able to capture the major features which facilitate the identification/classification of proteins, thus demonstrating that our predictor could be a more effective and promising high-throughput method in enzyme research. Moreover, a web-based software Enzyme Classification System (ECS) for identification as well as classification of enzymes can be accessed at: http://pcal.biosino.org/.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Enzyme"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Classification"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Functional domain composition"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Support vector machine"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1476927107000564", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1476927107000564", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "34248581521", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-34248581521", "pubmed-id": "17500036", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34248581521", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20070330", "$": "2007-03-30"}}}}}
