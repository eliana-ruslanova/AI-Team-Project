The aim is to study possible neural mechanisms of language processing and aid in development of artificial language processing systems. We used data sets containing recursive linguistic structures and trained the Elman simple recurrent network (SRN) for the next-symbol prediction task. Concentrating on neuron activation clusters in the recurrent layer of SRN we investigate the network state space organization before and after training. Given a SRN and a training stream, we construct predictive models, called neural prediction machines, that directly employ the state space dynamics of the network. We demonstrate two important properties of representations of recursive symbol series in the SRN. First, the clusters of recurrent activations emerging before training are meaningful and correspond to Markov prediction contexts. We show that prediction states that naturally arise in the SRN initialized with small random weights approximately correspond to states of Variable Memory Length Markov Models (VLMM) based on individual symbols (i.e.\u00a0words). Second, we demonstrate that during training, the SRN reorganizes its state space according to word categories and their grammatical subcategories, and the next-symbol prediction is again based on the VLMM strategy. However, after training, the prediction is based on word categories and their grammatical subcategories rather than individual words. Our conclusion holds for small depths of recursions that are comparable to human performances. The methods of SRN training and analysis of its state space introduced in this paper are of a general nature and can be used for investigation of processing of any other symbol time series by means of SRN.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Recurrent neural networks"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Linguistic structures"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Next-symbol prediction"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "State space analysis"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Language processing"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Markovian architectural bias"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Neural prediction machines"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Variable length Markov model"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608006000529", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608006000529", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "33847104144", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-33847104144", "pubmed-id": "16687236", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33847104144", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20060509", "$": "2006-05-09"}}}}}
