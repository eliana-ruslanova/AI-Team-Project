However, practicing UGRA can be challenging, since it requires high skilled and experienced operator. Among the difficult task that the operator can face, is the tracking of the nerve structure in ultrasound images. Tracking task in US images is very challenging due to the noise and other artifacts.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  In this paper, we introduce a new and robust tracking technique by using Adaptive Median Binary Pattern(AMBP) as texture feature for tracking algorithms (particle filter, mean-shift and Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi(KLT)). Moreover, we propose to incorporate Kalman filter as prediction and correction steps for the tracking algorithms, in order to enhance the accuracy, computational cost and handle target disappearance.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  The proposed method have been applied on real data and evaluated in different situations. The obtained results show that tracking with AMBP features outperforms other descriptors and achieved best performance with 95% accuracy.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  This paper presents the first fully automatic nerve tracking method in Ultrasound images. AMBP features outperforms other descriptors in all situations such as noisy and filtered images.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Texture analysis"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Feature extraction"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Robust feature tracking"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Nerve tracking"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Ultrasound images"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Regional anesthesia"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169260717309069", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260717309069", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85045114372", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85045114372", "pubmed-id": "29728240", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85045114372", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20180321", "$": "2018-03-21"}}}}}
