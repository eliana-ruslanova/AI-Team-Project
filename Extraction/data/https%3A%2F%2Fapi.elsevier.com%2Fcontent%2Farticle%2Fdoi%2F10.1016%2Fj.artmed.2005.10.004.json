Previous experiments have shown that students need practice in qualitative causal reasoning to internalize new knowledge and to apply it effectively and that they learn by putting their ideas into words.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  Analysis of a corpus of 75 hour-long tutoring sessions carried on in keyboard-to-keyboard style by two professors of physiology at Rush Medical College tutoring first-year medical students provided the rules used in tutoring strategies and tactics, parsing, and text generation. The system presents the student with a perturbation to the blood pressure, asks for qualitative predictions of the changes produced in seven important cardiovascular variables, and then launches a dialogue to correct any errors and to probe for possible misconceptions. The natural language understanding component uses a cascade of finite-state machines. The generation is based on lexical functional grammar.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  Results of experiments with pretests and posttests have shown that using the system for an hour produces significant learning gains and also that even this brief use improves the student's ability to solve problems more then reading textual material on the topic. Student surveys tell us that students like the system and feel that they learn from it. The system is now in regular use in the first-year physiology course at Rush Medical College.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion\n                  We conclude that the CIRCSIM\u2013Tutor system demonstrates that intelligent tutoring systems can implement effective natural language dialogue with current language technology.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Intelligent tutoring system"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Natural language dialogue"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Instructional planning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Dynamic planning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hierarchical planning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Reactive planning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Language understanding"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Dialogue generation"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0933365705001090", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365705001090", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "33747216646", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-33747216646", "pubmed-id": "16352427", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33747216646", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20051213", "$": "2005-12-13"}}}}}
