Our method is based on maximum likelihood estimation, using a gradient descent algorithm. This approach is similar to that used in conventional methods; however, we modify the likelihood function by adding a mechanism to alter the variance for each expert. The proposed method is demonstrated to successfully learn Markov chain switching among a set of 9 Lissajous curves, for which the conventional method fails. The learning performance, analyzed in terms of the generalization capability, of the proposed method is also shown to be superior to that of the conventional method. With the addition of a gating network, the proposed method is successfully applied to the learning of sensory\u2013motor flows for a small humanoid robot as a realistic problem of time series prediction and generation.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Recurrent neural network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Mixture of experts"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Maximum likelihood estimation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Self-organization"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Segmentation of temporal sequences"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608008001925", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608008001925", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "56949101180", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-56949101180", "pubmed-id": "18938059", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/56949101180", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20080927", "$": "2008-09-27"}}}}}
