An essential step during the management of urban areas from a sound standpoint should be the evaluation of the soundscape in such an area. In this sense, it has been widely acknowledged that a subjective and acoustical categorization of a soundscape is the first step to evaluate it, providing a basis for designing or adapting it to match people's expectations as well. In this sense, this work proposes a model for automatic classification of urban soundscapes. This model is intended for the automatic classification of urban soundscapes based on underlying acoustical and perceptual criteria. Thus, this classification model is proposed to be used as a tool for a comprehensive urban soundscape evaluation. Because of the great complexity associated with the problem, two machine learning techniques, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Support Vector Machines trained with Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), are implemented in developing model classification. The results indicate that the SMO model outperforms the SVM model in the specific task of soundscape classification. With the implementation of the SMO algorithm, the classification model achieves an outstanding performance (91.3% of instances correctly classified).\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Soundscape classifier"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Classification model"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Acoustical assessment"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Soundscape evaluation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Support Vector Machines"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Sequential Minimal Optimization"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969713008929", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969713008929", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84897959541", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84897959541", "pubmed-id": "24007752", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84897959541", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20130902", "$": "2013-09-02"}}}}}
