There is a great need for an effective means of rapidly assessing endocrine-disrupting activity, especially estrogen-simulating activity, because of the large number of such chemicals in the environment. In this study, quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models were developed to quickly and effectively identify possible estrogen-like chemicals based on 232 structurally-diverse chemicals (training set) by using several nonlinear classification methodologies (least-square support vector machine (LS-SVM), counter-propagation artificial neural network (CP-ANN), and k nearest neighbour (kNN)) based on molecular structural descriptors. The models were externally validated by 87 chemicals (prediction set) not included in the training set. All three methods can give satisfactory prediction results both for training and prediction sets, and the most accurate model was obtained by the LS-SVM approach through the comparison of performance. In addition, our model was also applied to about 58,000 discrete organic chemicals; about 76% were predicted not to bind to Estrogen Receptor. The obtained results indicate that the proposed QSAR models are robust, widely applicable and could provide a feasible and practical tool for the rapid screening of potential estrogens.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Endocrine disruptor"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "QSAR"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Environmental estrogens"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Classification"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "LS-SVM"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "CP-ANN"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1093326307000046", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1093326307000046", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "34250824089", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-34250824089", "pubmed-id": "17293141", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34250824089", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20070117", "$": "2007-01-17"}}}}}
