Several spherical SOMs which use lattices of the tessellated icosahedron have been proposed to solve this problem. However, existing data structures for such SOMs are either not space efficient or are time consuming when searching the neighborhood. We introduce a 2D rectangular grid data structure to store the icosahedron-based geodesic dome. Vertices relationships are maintained by their positions in the data structure rather than by immediate neighbor pointers or an adjacency list. Increasing the number of neurons can be done efficiently because the overhead caused by pointer updates is reduced. Experiments show that the spherical SOM using our data structure, called a GeoSOM, runs with comparable speed to the conventional 2D SOM. The GeoSOM also reduces data distortion due to removal of the boundaries. Furthermore, we developed an interface to project the GeoSOM onto the 2D plane using a cartographic approach, which gives users a global view of the spherical data map. Users can change the center of the 2D data map interactively. In the end, we compare the GeoSOM to the other spherical SOMs by space complexity and time complexity.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Spherical SOM"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Geodesic dome"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Data structure"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "GeoSOM"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Border effect"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608006000736", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608006000736", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "33746658652", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-33746658652", "pubmed-id": "16787738", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33746658652", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20060619", "$": "2006-06-19"}}}}}
