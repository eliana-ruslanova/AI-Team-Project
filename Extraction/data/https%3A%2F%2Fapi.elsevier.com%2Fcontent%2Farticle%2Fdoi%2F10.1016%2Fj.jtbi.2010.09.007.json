In this study, three novel features were rationally designed to model the differences between proteins from these two classes. In combination with other rational designed features, an 11-dimensional vector prediction method was proposed. By means of this method, the overall prediction accuracy based on 25PDB dataset was 1.5% higher than the previous best-performing method, MODAS. Furthermore, the prediction accuracy for proteins from \u03b1+\u03b2 class based on 25PDB dataset was 5% higher than the previous best-performing method, SCPRED. The prediction accuracies obtained with the D675 and FC699 datasets were also improved.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Protein structural class prediction"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Secondary structure"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Alternating frequency"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Parallel and anti-parallel \u03b2-sheets"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Support vector machine"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002251931000473X", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002251931000473X", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "77956623830", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-77956623830", "pubmed-id": "20831876", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77956623830", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20100908", "$": "2010-09-08"}}}}}
