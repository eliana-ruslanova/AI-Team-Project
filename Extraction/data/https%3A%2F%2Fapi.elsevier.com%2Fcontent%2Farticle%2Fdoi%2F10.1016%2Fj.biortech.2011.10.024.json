Genetic algorithm (GA) has been used for the optimization of P(3HB-co-3HV) production through the simulation of artificial neural network (ANN) and response surface methodology (RSM). The predictions by ANN are better than those of RSM and in good agreement with experimental findings. The highest P(3HB-co-3HV) concentration and 3HV content have been reported as 7.35g/l and 16.84mol%, respectively by hybrid ANN\u2013GA. Upon validation, 7.20g/l and 16.30mol% of P(3HB-co-3HV) concentration and 3HV content have been found in the shake flask, whereas 6.70g/l and 16.35mol%, have been observed in a 3l bioreactor, respectively. The specific growth rate and P(3HB-co-3HV) accumulation rate of 0.29 per h and 0.16g/lh determined with cane molasses are comparable to those observed on pure substrates.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Cane molasses"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "\n                     Azohydromonas lata\n                  "}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate)"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Genetic algorithm"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial neural network"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960852411014702", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960852411014702", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84655176471", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84655176471", "pubmed-id": "22074908", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84655176471", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20111021", "$": "2011-10-21"}}}}}
