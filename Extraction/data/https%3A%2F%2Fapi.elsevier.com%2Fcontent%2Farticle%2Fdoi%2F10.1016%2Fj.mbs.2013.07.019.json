S-systems are easy to be generalized to large systems. The systems are identified through data-driven identification techniques (cluster-based algorithms or computational methods). However, S-systems\u2032 identification is challenging because multiple attractors exist in such highly nonlinear systems. Moreover, in some biological systems the interactive effect cannot be neglected even the interaction order is small. Therefore, learning should be focused on increasing the gap between the true and redundant interaction. In addition, a wide searching space is necessary because no prior information is provided. The used technologies should have the ability to achieve convergence enhancement and diversity preservation. Cockroaches live in nearly all habitats and survive for more than 300 million years. In this paper, we mimic cockroaches\u2032 competitive swarm behavior and integrated it with advanced evolutionary operations. The proposed cockroach genetic algorithm (CGA) possesses strong snatching-food ability to rush forward to a target and high migration ability to escape from local minimum. CGA was tested with three small-scale systems, a twenty-state medium-scale system and a thirty-state large-scale system. A wide search space ([0,100] for rate constants and [\u2212100,100] for kinetic orders) with random or bad initial starts are used to show the high exploration performance.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Inverse problem"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "S-system"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Memetic algorithm"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Cockroach swarm evolution"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Structure identification"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025556413001831", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025556413001831", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84884148461", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84884148461", "pubmed-id": "23927855", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84884148461", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20130806", "$": "2013-08-06"}}}}}
