The size of these datasets creates a need for automated clustering methods to group the streamlines into meaningful bundles. Conventional clustering techniques group streamlines based on their spatial coordinates. Neuroanatomists, however, define white-matter bundles based on the anatomical structures that they go through or next to, rather than their spatial coordinates. Thus we propose a similarity measure for clustering streamlines based on their position relative to cortical and subcortical brain regions. We incorporate this measure into a hierarchical clustering algorithm and compare it to a measure that relies on Euclidean distance, using data from the Human Connectome Project. We show that the anatomical similarity measure leads to a \n                        \n                           20\n                           %\n                        \n                      improvement in the overlap of clusters with manually labeled tracts. Importantly, this is achieved without introducing any prior information from a tract atlas into the clustering algorithm, therefore without imposing the existence of any named tracts.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hierarchical clustering"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Normalized cuts"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Tractography"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Diffusion MRI"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1053811917308923", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811917308923", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85032745260", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85032745260", "pubmed-id": "29100937", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85032745260", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20171101", "$": "2017-11-01"}}}}}
