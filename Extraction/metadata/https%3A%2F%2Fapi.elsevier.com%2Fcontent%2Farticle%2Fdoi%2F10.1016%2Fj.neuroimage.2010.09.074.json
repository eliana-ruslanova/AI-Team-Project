Our approach involves limited supervision in the form of labeled instances from two distributions that reflect a rough guess about subspace of features that are relevant for cluster analysis. By assuming that images are defined in a common space via registration to a common template, we propose a segmentation-based method for detecting locations that signify local regional differences in the two labeled sets. A PCA model of local image appearance is then estimated at each location of interest, and ranked with respect to its relevance for clustering. We develop an incremental k-means-like algorithm that discovers novel meaningful categories in a test image set. The application of our approach in this paper is in analysis of populations of healthy older adults. We validate our approach on a synthetic dataset, as well as on a dataset of brain images of older adults. We assess our method's performance on the problem of discovering clusters of MR images of human brain, and present a cluster-based measure of pathology that reflects the deviation of a subject's MR image from normal (i.e. cognitively stable) state. We analyze the clusters' structure, and show that clustering results obtained using our approach correlate well with clinical data.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Cluster analysis"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Semi-supervised pattern analysis"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "MRI"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Aging"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "MCI"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1053811910012760", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811910012760", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "78650206305", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-78650206305", "pubmed-id": "20933091", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/78650206305", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20101007", "$": "2010-10-07"}}}}}
