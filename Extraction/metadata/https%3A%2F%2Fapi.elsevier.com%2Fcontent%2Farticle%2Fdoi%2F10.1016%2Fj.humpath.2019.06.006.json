Each patient history is discussed by well-known neurologists, neurosurgeons, and neuropathologists. Review of these cases provides a framework to explore diagnostic shifts that have occurred over the past half century. Importantly, while the discussants of these cases were great diagnosticians, they were somewhat limited by the methods available to them at the time; subsequent novel technologies provided opportunities for new insights that were made by the next generation of experts. Today's pathologists (whether neuropathologists or any other pathology subspecialists) are similarly skilled at diagnosis, although their diagnoses are now more often made on biopsies (rather than autopsies) and informed by pre-operative imaging studies as well as post-operative molecular analyses. In turn, one would conclude that, even in the face of future technological changes brought about by disruptive innovations like artificial intelligence and deep molecular analyses, a need will continue for the expertise of pathologists and other clinical diagnosticians.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Tumor classification"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "History of pathology"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Neuropathology"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Brain tumor"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Clinicopathological conference"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0046817719301248", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0046817719301248", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85070229763", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85070229763", "pubmed-id": "31302204", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85070229763", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20190711", "$": "2019-07-11"}}}}}
