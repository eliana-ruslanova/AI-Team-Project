The auditory nerve encodes the acoustic sounds that are conveyed to the auditory brainstem. Multiple brainstem nuclei, the cochlea, the midbrain, the thalamus, and the cortex constitute the central auditory system. In clinical practice, auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to simple stimuli such as click or tones are widely used. Recently, complex stimuli or complex auditory brain responses (cABRs), such as monosyllabic speech stimuli and music, are being used as a tool to study the brainstem processing of speech sounds. We have used the classic \u2018click\u2019 as well as, for the first time, the artificial successive complex stimuli \u2018ba\u2019, which constitutes the Greek word \u2018baba\u2019 corresponding to the English \u2018daddy\u2019.\n               \n               \n                  Patients and methods\n                  Twenty young adults institutionally diagnosed as dyslexic (10 subjects) or light dyslexic (10 subjects) comprised the diseased group. Twenty sex-, age-, education-, hearing sensitivity-, and IQ-matched normal subjects comprised the control group. Measurements included the absolute latencies of waves I through V, the interpeak latencies elicited by the classical acoustic click, the negative peak latencies of A and C waves, as well as the interpeak latencies of A\u2013C elicited by the verbal stimulus \u2018baba\u2019 created on a digital speech synthesizer.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  The absolute peak latencies of waves I, III, and V in response to monoaural rarefaction clicks as well as the interpeak latencies I\u2013III, III\u2013V, and I\u2013V in the dyslexic subjects, although increased in comparison with normal subjects, did not reach the level of a significant difference (p<0.05). However, the absolute peak latencies of the negative wave C and the interpeak latencies of A\u2013C elicited by verbal stimuli were found to be increased in the dyslexic group in comparison with the control group (p=0.0004 and p=0.045, respectively). In the subgroup consisting of 10 patients suffering from \u2018other learning disabilities\u2019 and who were characterized as with \u2018light\u2019 dyslexia according to dyslexia tests, no significant delays were found in peak latencies A and C and interpeak latencies A\u2013C in comparison with the control group.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  Acoustic representation of a speech sound and, in particular, the disyllabic word \u2018baba\u2019 was found to be abnormal, as low as the auditory brainstem. Because ABRs mature in early life, this can help to identify subjects with acoustically based learning problems and apply early intervention, rehabilitation, and treatment. Further studies and more experience with more patients and pathological conditions such as plasticity of the auditory system, cochlear implants, hearing aids, presbycusis, or acoustic neuropathy are necessary until this type of testing is ready for clinical application.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196070913001609", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196070913001609", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84887043073", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84887043073", "pubmed-id": "23953938", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84887043073", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20130813", "$": "2013-08-13"}}}}}
