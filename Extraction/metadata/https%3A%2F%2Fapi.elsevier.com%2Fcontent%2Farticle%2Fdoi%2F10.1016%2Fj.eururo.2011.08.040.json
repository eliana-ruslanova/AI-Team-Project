Despite greater complexity, no group 1 tumor required hilar clamping, and perioperative outcomes were similar to those of group 2: operating room time (4.7 and 4.1h), median blood loss (200 and 100ml), surgical margins for cancer (all negative), major complications (0% and 9%), and minor complications (18% and 14%). The median serum creatinine level was similar 2 mo postoperatively (1.2 and 1.3mg/dl). The study was limited by the relatively small sample size.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  Anatomic targeted dissection and superselective control of tumor-specific renal arterial branches facilitate zero-ischemia PN. Even challenging medial and hilar tumors can be excised without hilar clamping. Global surgical renal ischemia has been eliminated for most patients undergoing PN at our institution.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Partial nephrectomy"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Laparoscopy"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Robotic"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Zero-ischemia"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0302283811009080", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0302283811009080", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "82255191690", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-82255191690", "pubmed-id": "21908096", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/82255191690", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20110831", "$": "2011-08-31"}}}}}
