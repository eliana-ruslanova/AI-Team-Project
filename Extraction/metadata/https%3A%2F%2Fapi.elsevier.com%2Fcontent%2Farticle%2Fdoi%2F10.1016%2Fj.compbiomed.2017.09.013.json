In such a setting, relatively stable and high performances are often reported because subjects could consistently perform muscle contractions corresponding to a targeted limb motion. Meanwhile the clinical implementation of EMG-PR method is characterized by degradations in stability and classification performances due to the disparities between the constrained laboratory setting and clinical use. One of such disparities is the mobility of subject that would cause changes in the EMG signal patterns when eliciting identical limb motions in mobile scenarios. In this study, the effect of mobility on the performance of EMG-PR motion classifier was firstly investigated based on myoelectric and accelerometer signals acquired from six upper-limb amputees across four scenarios. Secondly, three methods were proposed to mitigate such effect on the EMG-PR motion classifier. From the obtained results, an average classification error (CE) of 9.50% (intra-scenario) was achieved when data from the same scenarios were used to train and test the EMG-PR classifier, while the CE increased to 18.48% (inter-scenario) when trained and tested with dataset from different scenarios. This implies that mobility would significantly lead to about 8.98% increase of classification error (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). By applying the proposed methods, the degradation in classification performance was significantly reduced from 8.98% to 1.86% (Dual-stage sequential method), 3.17% (Hybrid strategy), and 4.64% (Multi-scenario strategy). Hence, the proposed methods may potentially improve the clinical robustness of the currently available multifunctional prostheses.\n               \n               \n                  Trial registration\n                  The study was approved by the ethics committee of Institutional Review Board of Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, and the reference number is SIAT-IRB-150515-H0077.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Effect of mobility"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Upper-limb prostheses control"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "EMG-Pattern recognition"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Limb motion identification"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Amputees"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010482517303116", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482517303116", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85029817181", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85029817181", "pubmed-id": "28961473", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85029817181", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20170921", "$": "2017-09-21"}}}}}
