Relying on the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between October 2008 and December 2009, patients treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) were identified. The robot-assisted modifier (17.4x) was used to identify RARP (n\n                     =11 889). Patients with the minimally invasive modifier code (54.21) without the robot-assisted modifier were classified as having undergone LRP and were removed from further analyses. The remainder were classified as ORP patients (n\n                     =7389).\n               \n               \n                  Intervention\n                  All patients underwent RARP or ORP.\n               \n               \n                  Measurements\n                  We compared the rates of blood transfusions, intraoperative and postoperative complications, prolonged length of stay (pLOS), and in-hospital mortality. Multivariable logistic regression analyses of propensity score\u2013matched populations, fitted with general estimation equations for clustering among hospitals, further adjusted for confounding factors.\n               \n               \n                  Results and limitations\n                  Of 19 462 RPs, 61.1% were RARPs, 38.0% were ORPs, and 0.9% were LRPs. In multivariable analyses of propensity score\u2013matched populations, patients undergoing RARP were less likely to receive a blood transfusion (odds ratio [OR]: 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28\u20130.40), to experience an intraoperative complication (OR: 0.47; 95% CI, 0.31\u20130.71) or a postoperative complication (OR: 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77\u20130.96), and to experience a pLOS (OR: 0.28; 95% CI, 0.26\u20130.30). Limitations of this study include lack of adjustment for tumor characteristics, surgeon volume, learning curve effect, and longitudinal follow-up.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  RARP has supplanted ORP as the most common surgical approach for RP. Moreover, we demonstrate superior adjusted perioperative outcomes after RARP in virtually all examined outcomes.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Prostatic neoplasms"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Prostatectomy"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Minimally invasive"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Robotic"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Open"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0302283811014114", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0302283811014114", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84857650569", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84857650569", "pubmed-id": "22206800", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84857650569", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20111222", "$": "2011-12-22"}}}}}
