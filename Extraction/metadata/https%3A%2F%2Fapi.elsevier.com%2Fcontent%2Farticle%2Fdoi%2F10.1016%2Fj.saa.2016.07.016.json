A comparative study between the firefly algorithm and the well-known genetic algorithm was developed. The discussion revealed the superiority of using this new powerful algorithm over the well-known genetic algorithm. Moreover, different statistical tests were performed and no significant differences were found between all the models regarding their predictabilities. This ensures that simpler and faster models were obtained without any deterioration of the quality of the calibration.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Firefly algorithm"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Genetic algorithm"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Concentration residual augmented classical least squares"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial neural network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Support vector regression"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386142516303997", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386142516303997", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84978239469", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84978239469", "pubmed-id": "27423110", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84978239469", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20160710", "$": "2016-07-10"}}}}}
