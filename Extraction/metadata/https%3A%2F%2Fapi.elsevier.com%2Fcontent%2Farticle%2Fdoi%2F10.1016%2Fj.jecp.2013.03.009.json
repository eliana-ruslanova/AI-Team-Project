We examined whether a letter\u2013speech sound binding deficit is behaviorally detectable within the initial steps of learning a novel script. Both letter knowledge and word reading ability within the artificial script were assessed. An additional goal was to investigate the influence of instructional approach on the initial learning of letter\u2013speech sound correspondences. We assigned children from both groups to one of three different training conditions: (a) explicit instruction, (b) implicit associative learning within a computer game environment, or (c) a combination of (a) and (b) in which explicit instruction is followed by implicit learning. Our results indicated that dyslexics were outperformed by the controls on a time-pressured binding task and a word reading task within the artificial orthography, providing empirical support for the view that a letter\u2013speech sound binding deficit is a key factor in dyslexia. A combination of explicit instruction and implicit techniques proved to be a more powerful tool in the initial teaching of letter\u2013sound correspondences than implicit training alone.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Dyslexia"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Letter\u2013speech sound binding deficit"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial orthography"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Instructional approach"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Implicit learning"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Edugames"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022096513000659", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022096513000659", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84878556693", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84878556693", "pubmed-id": "23708733", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84878556693", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20130523", "$": "2013-05-23"}}}}}
