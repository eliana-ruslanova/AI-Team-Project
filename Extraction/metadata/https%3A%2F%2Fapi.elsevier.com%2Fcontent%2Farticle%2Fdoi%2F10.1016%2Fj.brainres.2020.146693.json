The neural mechanisms of spoken word segmentation for English as a second language (ESL) learners remain elusive. The present study, using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), addresses this issue by measuring hemodynamic responses in the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in a word-spotting task, designed with two task conditions (easy vs. difficult). Thirty participants, divided into a high listening proficiency group (HLG) and a low listening proficiency group (LLG), were tested. Results revealed significantly less TPJ activation in the HLG than in the LLG. Further analyses supported this result by showing that activation in the TPJ was in a negative correlation with listening proficiency. This association appears to be related to the more efficient use of processing resources in a bottom-up fashion for accurate and efficient sensory representations in high proficient language learners. In contrast, cortical activation in the PFC increased with listening proficiency and was stronger in the difficult task condition than in the easy task condition, implying that recruitment of top-down cognitive control functions might play a role in word segmentation. Our results suggest that the combination of the functions mediated via bottom-up sensory input processing (demonstrated in the TPJ activation) and top-down cognitive processing (demonstrated in the PFC activation) are crucial for ESL listeners\u2019 spoken word segmentation.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Spoken word segmentation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Word-spotting task"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Temporo-parietal junction"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Prefrontal cortex"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006899320300494", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006899320300494", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85079595660", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85079595660", "pubmed-id": "32006554", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85079595660", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20200130", "$": "2020-01-30"}}}}}
