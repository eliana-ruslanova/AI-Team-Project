There has been increasing interest in being able to predict an individual\u2019s decision-making response (i.e., acceptance or rejection). We proposed an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based computational intelligence framework to predict individual responses. Specifically, the discriminative spatial network pattern (DSNP), a supervised learning approach, was applied to single-trial EEG data to extract the DSNP feature from the single-trial brain network. A linear discriminate analysis (LDA) trained on the DSNP features was then used to predict the individual response trial-by-trial. To verify the performance of the proposed DSNP, we recruited two independent subject groups, and recorded the EEGs using two types of EEG systems. The performances of the trial-by-trial predictors achieved an accuracy of 0.88\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.09 for the first dataset, and 0.90\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.10 for the second dataset. These trial-by-trial prediction performances suggested that individual responses could be predicted trial-by-trial by using the specific pattern of single-trial EEG networks, and our proposed method has the potential to establish the biologically inspired artificial intelligence decision system. Highlights \u2022 A single-trial EEG based approach is developed to predict individual decision-making response. \u2022 A supervised learning approach is developed to extract the discriminative spatial network pattern. \u2022 The proposed approach achieves the high prediction performances (over 0.88) for two independent EEG datasets. Keywords Decision-making Electroencephalogram (EEG) Discriminative spatial network pattern Brain network Single-trial prediction 1 Introduction Decision-making is a complex cognitive process triggered by daily choices and is always associated with emotion, personality, and motivation (Cecchetto et al., 2017; Hastie, 2001; Preuss et al., 2016; Sanfey, 2007). Decision-making plays an essential role in interpersonal interactions and social stabilities across cultures (Basten et al., 2010; Si et al., 2018). The reliable prediction of individual responses to different fairness conditions (i.e., how the subject makes decisions with preference) is helpful in the establishment of a natural and responsive artificial intelligence system (Long et al., 2012a). Recent studies have tried to predict the individual decision responses from different aspects. For example, the best-fitting computational model utilized both expected and experienced feelings about potential outcomes to predict choices, which revealed that the loss aversion in decision-making was explained by an asymmetry in how feelings about losses and gains were weighted when making a choice (Charpentier et al., 2016). The effect of approximate numeric abilities could also be considered a factor that can predict objectively advantageous decision-making, even beyond the effects of executive functions (Mueller et al., 2018). In terms of intrinsic resting-state brain activity, the functional connectivity among the brain regions derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was utilized to predict individual impulsivity of decision-making, suggesting that the functional connectivity of the human brain may be a biomarker of decision impulsivity (Li et al., 2013). However, the existing approaches predicting individual decision response mainly focused on the averaged measurements of the neurophysiological data, and the averaging across multiple identical trials typically discards information about trial-to-trial variability (Blankertz et al., 2011), while this variability can be a consequence of variation in the design and can also reflect the varied individual states (Ratcliff et al., 2009). Although a large amounts of efforts has been invested, the accurate prediction of decision response for an individual remains far from accurate, especially online, where it is urgently required by the practical human-computer interaction (HCI) systems. In essence, the reliable prediction is largely dependent on how the neural mechanism underlying decision-making is revealed. Decision-making engages multiple brain areas, such as the frontal lobe, insula, parietal lobe, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (Bartra et al., 2013; Buschman and Miller, 2007; Critchley et al., 2000; Krain et al., 2006; Suzuki et al., 2012). The interactions among these brain regions have also been demonstrated to contribute to the decision-making. When making a decision, the association between the right insula and the inferior frontal cortex plays a crucial role in the integration of bottom-up, sensory information with top-down, response-related information to goal-directed behavior (Dodds et al., 2010). The reward-guided decision also depends on a brain network that involves the frontal lobe and ACC, and even macaque monkeys recruited similar regions during reward-guided decision-making tasks (Neubert et al., 2015). Moreover, one current study utilizing the time-varying network analysis of scalp EEG also reveals that, when subjects perform the different decision responses, the distinct network patterns can be observed (Si et al., 2018). Neurophysiological signals, such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and (fMRI), are known to contain the important decision information that can be utilized for decision assessment (B\u00e9nar et al., 2007; Blankertz et al., 2011). In addition to accuracy, another aspect that is important for the prediction system is the timely requirement, i.e., the online prediction. Therefore, EEG, with its high temporal resolution and easy setup, provides the potential to establish a practical decision-making prediction system. To realize the online prediction, it is necessary to establish a trial-by-trial analysis approach to predict the individual response using single-trial EEG. However, though some existing studies have probed the prediction of decision making behavior, those previous works mainly paid more attention to predict the overall individual behavioral response (LvC et al., 2019; NK Glober and TM Abramson, 2019), i.e., the acceptance rates after the whole DM experiment instead of the instantaneous response of subject during experiment. For example, neurocognitive indicators of disinhibition (stop signal reaction time) and decision-making (card playing task) could effectively predict relapse in pathological gamblers to guide the corresponding treatment plan (Goudriaan et al., 2008). Recently, regional homogeneity patterns in the dorsal prefrontal cortex were examined to predict individual differences in decision impulsivity (LvC et al., 2019). These indexes across multiple identical trials will inevitably lose information reflected by trial-to-trial variability, and the single-trial based prediction that can provide the instantaneous information for subject\u2019s DM behavior has not been reported yet. There has been growing interest to the single-trial detection of human cognition functions, which has the potential to establish the biologically inspired artificial intelligence systems (Hsu, 2013; Hsu et al., 2007; S Debener et al., 2006). In this study, motivated by the involved networks in decision-making, we aimed to develop an EEG-based computational intelligence framework to predict the individual trial-by-trial response in decision-making. To fulfill this aim, the EEG data sets were collected when subjects participated in an Ultimatum Game (UG) task. Thereafter, based on the single-trial networks of distinct decision responses (i.e., acceptance and rejection), we analyzed the topological differences between acceptance and rejection to examine the neural mechanism underlying decision-making. Considering the rather lower signal to noise ratio (SNR) of a single EEG trial, the supervised learning was then adapted to extract the discriminative spatial network topology in single-trial EEG. A linear discriminate analysis (LDA) classifier that was trained by the discriminative spatial network topology was adopted to perform the single-trial prediction of individual responses in the UG task. Finally, to investigate the reliability of our proposed approach, these analyses were replicated on two independent EEG data sets recorded by two different EEG systems from two independent subject groups. 2 Material and methods 2.1 Participants Two independent groups (datasets A and B) of subjects participated in this study at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). None of the subjects had a history of neurological or psychiatric disorders, and they were not currently using any psychoactive medications. The experiment protocol was approved by the Institution Research Ethics Board of the UESTC. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects before they joined the study. 2.2 Experimental protocol In this study, we adopted the UG to simulated actual decision-making, which is a typical dyadic bargaining situation that can be utilized to explore physiological correlates of the decision processing (Koenigs and Tranel, 2007). Various studies have proved that UG can simulate the actual decision-making well, and it can reflect fairness consideration in asset division and highlight the social context that influences social decisions and outcome processing, partially depending on inter-individual differences (Horat et al., 2017; Peterburs et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2011). The experiments were performed in a quiet, dimly light room. In the first 2\u202fmin, subjects were instructed to take deep breaths to adapt to the experimental environment. Then, 5\u202fmin of eye-closed resting-state EEG data sets were recorded prior to the UG task. Thereafter, subjects participated in the UG task that lasted approximately 8.5\u202fmin. In the UG task, the subject (responder) was prompted to decide whether to accept an offer of the proposer (the computer). If the subject accepted the offer, both players (the responder and the proposer) received the money provided by the proposer; on the contrary, they would earn nothing. During the experiment, the subjects were instructed to be the role of the responder in every trial, and then they were told to play the game with another subject, i.e., the proposer, who sat in another room. Fig. 1 shows the timeline of the UG. In the experiment, the sum was splits of \u00a5 10. The experiment included three categories of conditions: the fair offers (\u00a5 5: \u00a5 5) and the unfair offers, which consisted of extremely (\u00a5 1: \u00a5 9) and moderately unfair (\u00a5 3: \u00a5 7) offers. Subjects received 90 offers that were randomly chosen by the computer, with 30 trials for each of the three conditions. Each trial lasted a period of 800\u202fms starting with the presentation of a fixation crosshair. Then, a note lasting with 500\u202fms was given to indicate the amount of the sum. After 1000\u202fms of black screen, the proposed offer was presented for 1500\u202fms. During this interval, the subjects were required to decide to reject (press the button \u201c3\u201d key on the keyboard) or accept (press the button \u201c1\u201d key on the keyboard) the offer. Subsequently, the players would receive the amount of money assigned to them on that trial, and the cumulative amount of the subject\u2019s winnings were simultaneously presented for 1200\u202fms after pressing the response key. Before a formal session, all subjects were required to try a preliminary round to ensure that the rules of the game were clear. 2.3 EEG data acquisition For Group A, the BrainAmp amplifier (Brain Products GmbH), hereinafter termed amplifier-1, was used to collect the EEG data sets. Electrodes FCz and AFz served as the reference and ground, respectively. For Group B, the ASA-Lab amplifier (ANT Neuro), termed amplifier-2, was adopted, along with the reference and ground being assigned as electrodes CPz and AFz, respectively. The 64-channel UG-EEG data sets of both groups were recorded and digitized with a sampling rate of 500\u202fHz. The electro-oculogram (EOG) was recorded from an extra electrode located above the side of the left eye to monitor eye movements. Throughout the entire experiment, the impedance of each electrode was maintained below 5\u202fk\u03a9. 2.4 A single-trial EEG-based prediction framework In this study based on two independent EEG data sets, we proposed an EEG-based single-trial prediction framework to predict individual decision response, including EEG preprocessing, EPRs extraction, brain network construction, network properties calculation, and single-trial prediction based on the discriminative spatial network pattern (DSNP). The first group (dataset A) consisted of 14 subjects (8 males and 6 females, age range: 21\u201326 years, and mean age: 23.29 years), and the BrainAmp amplifier manufactured by Brain Products GmbH was used for EEG recording. In the second group (dataset B), there were 20 subjects (16 males, and 4 females, age range: 19\u201325 years, mean age: 22.27 years), and the ASA-Lab amplifier provided by ANT Neuro was adopted for EEG recording. 2.4.1 Data preprocessing The preprocessing pipeline was targeted to acquire reliable acceptance and rejection trials for each subject. The preprocessing procedures included the common average reference, 1\u201320\u202fHz band-pass filtering (Si et al., 2018), [-200\u202fms, 800\u202fms] data segmenting, [-200\u202fms, 0\u202fms] baseline correcting, artifact trial removal (\u00b160\u202f\u03bcV as threshold), and single-trial denoising on each electrode by using the wavelet toolkit (Cai and Silverman, 2001). 2.4.2 EPRs extraction The medial frontal negativity (MFN, 220\u202fms\u2013350\u202fms, 0\u202fms: the onset of stimulus) is an important EEG component during the processing of decision-making (Peterburs et al., 2017). Therefore, we first evaluated whether the decision-making related MFN component could predict the responses of decision-making based on a single EEG trial. MFN amplitude was subsequently extracted from the single trial ERP on F3, Fz and F4, where the MFN usually occurs (Wang et al., 2016). Considering the latency effect on MFN estimation, the MFN amplitude is defined as the mean amplitude in the time window \u00b120\u202fms, with the largest negative MFN peak at the center (Fig. 2 ). After MFN was extracted from the three electrodes, the three MFN amplitudes were combined together to form a 3 dimensional feature for the prediction of decision-making response based on each single trial EEG. 2.4.3 Network construction Coherence (COH) is one of the most commonly used methods to analyze the synchrony-defined cortical neuronal assemblies, which could capture the coupling in the frequency domain (Thatcher et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2014). Previous studies have revealed that the relationship between brain network and cognition functions, such as attention and motor imagery, could be analyzed efficiently by the COH method (Li et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2015). COH measures the linear relationship at a specific frequency between two signals X(t) and Y(t) based on their cross- and auto-spectrum. In this study, we thereby adopted frequency-specific COH to estimate the connection strength between pairs of network nodes. Mathematically, COH is expressed as follows: (1) C X Y ( f ) = | P X Y ( f ) | 2 P X X ( f ) P Y Y ( f ) where P XY (f) is the cross-spectrum of X(t) and Y(t) at frequency f, and P XX (f) and P YY (f) indicate the auto spectrum at frequency f estimated from the Welch-based spectrum of X(t) and Y(t), respectively. The coherence is computed from the entire single trial (i.e., the 1\u202fs from \u2212200\u202fms to 800\u202fms), and the frequency band employed is from 1 to 20\u202fHz. The connection strength between each pair of nodes was acquired by averaging the COH values within the concerned frequency band. The 21 canonical electrodes (FP1, FPz, FP2, F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8, T7, C3, Cz, C4, T8, P7, P3, Pz, P4, P8, O1, O2, Oz) of the 10\u201320 system were used to construct the brain network to reduce the effect of volume conduction (Li et al., 2016). In amplifier-1 in the current study, however, only 12 electrodes (F3, Fz, F4, C5, Cz, C6, P3, Pz, P4, O1, Oz, O2) of the 21 canonical electrodes consistently worked well across all the subjects, and they were therefore selected and used to construct the brain network. For amplifier-2, 21 canonical electrodes consistently worked well during the UG experiment across subjects and were used in further analysis. After calculating the COH between each pair of electrodes, the 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f12 or 21\u202f\u00d7\u202f21 weighted adjacency (connectivity) matrix was achieved to denote interactions among the 12 or 21 nodes for each trial. Then, the brain network was constructed based on the 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f12 (or 21\u202f\u00d7\u202f21 for amplifier-2) weighted adjacency (connectivity) matrix using the corresponding COH as the network edge between nodes i and j, where C ij is the edge linkage strength between nodes i and j obtained by Eq. (1). 2.4.4 Network properties To quantitatively measure the single-trial brain network, four network properties, namely clustering coefficient (Clu), global efficiency (Ge), local efficiency (Le), and characteristic path length (L) were then calculated (Li et al., 2018, 2019b). The detailed definitions of these properties were formulated as follows, (2) C l u = 1 N W \u2211 i \u2208 \u03b8 \u2211 j , l \u2208 \u03b8 ( C i j C i l C j j ) 1 / 3 \u2211 j \u2208 w i j ( \u2211 j \u2208 \u03b8 C i j \u2212 1 ) (3) L e = 1 N W \u2211 i \u2208 \u03b8 \u2211 j , l \u2208 \u03b8 , j \u2260 i ( C i j C i l [ d j l ( \u03b8 i ) ] \u2212 1 ) 1 / 3 \u2211 j \u2208 \u03b8 C i j ( \u2211 j \u2208 \u03b8 C i j \u2212 1 ) (4) G e = 1 N W \u2211 i \u2208 \u03b8 \u2211 j \u2208 \u03b8 , j \u2260 i d i j \u2212 1 N W \u2212 1 (5) L = 1 N W \u2211 i \u2208 \u03b8 L i = 1 N W \u2211 i \u2208 \u03b8 \u2211 j \u2208 \u03b8 , j \u2260 i d i j N W \u2212 1 where d ij is the shortest weighted path length between i and j, NW is the node number, and \u03b8 is the set of all nodes in a single-trial network. Specifically, Clu is defined as the fraction of triangles around an individual network node. L e is the average efficiency of the local subgraphs. Clu and L e are related to the estimation of the potential for functional segregation between brain regions. Ge is the average efficiency of the related brain network, and L is the mean value of the shortest path length between all pairs of network nodes. 2.4.5 DSNP-based single-trial prediction While the network topology determines the network properties, the network properties alone cannot fully describe the network topology. Given that different cognitive tasks give rise to different network structures (Dixon et al., 2017; Li et al., 2016; Young et al., 2017), it is plausible that formal mathematical discrimination of spatial topology could differentiate different tasks. Therefore, we tested the discriminative spatial network pattern, a supervised learning approach, as a tool for single-trial prediction. An overview of the procedure is depicted in Fig. 3 . As illustrated in Fig. 3, to simulate an online condition, we supposed N trials in the UG task for one subject, then divided the N trials into training and testing sets based on the presented time, where the former N/2 trials occurring relatively earlier served as the training set, and the remaining N/2 trials were used as the testing set. Therefore, the DSPN-based single-trial prediction consisted of the training and single-trial prediction procedures. The training procedure has two aims in this prediction framework, one is to train the predictor model, and another is to learn the spatial filters that can be used to extract DSNP feature for the testing trials. To fulfill this goal, in the training procedure as shown in Fig. 3(a), after we calculated the coherence network of each trial (Zhang et al., 2015), we use the DSNP to estimate the spatial filter and then to extract the discriminative spatial pattern of the weighted brain network based on the training set (Xu et al., 2014). Finally, the prediction model of DSNP features for different decision responses was trained by the LDA algorithm (Boulgouris and Chi, 2007). Specifically, we let C 1 (k) and C 2 (m) be the adjacency matrix for the k-th trial of rejection and for the m-th trial of acceptance in the training set, respectively. Supposing that there are N 1 trials for rejection and N 2 trials for acceptance with N 1 \u200b+ \u200bN 2 = N/2, the mean adjacency matrices for the two responses are defined as, (6) C 1 = 1 N 1 \u2211 k = 1 N 1 C 1 ( k ) , C 2 = 1 N 2 \u2211 m = 1 N 2 C 2 ( m ) where C 1 and C 2 are with dimension of 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f12 for amplifier-1 and 21\u202f\u00d7\u202f21 for amplifier-2. Accordingly, C 1 and C 2 contain the spatial network patterns of the acceptance and rejection responses, respectively. To extract the discriminative spatial network pattern, we applied a linear spatial filter p with dimension of 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f12 for the amplifier-1 or 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f21 for the amplifier-2 to the C 1 and C 2 as, (7) Y 1 = p C 1 , Y 2 = p C 2 The aim of the spatial filter is to enhance the differences of spatial network topology between the two responses, which is equivalent to maximize the following generalized Rayleigh quotient, (8) arg p max J ( p ) = Y 1 Y 1 T Y 2 Y 2 T = p C 1 C 1 T p T p C 2 C 2 T p T = p \u03a6 1 p T p \u03a6 2 p T where \u03a61 and \u03a62 are the covariance matrices of C 1 and C 2 , respectively. Considering that the scaling of the projection p will have no effect on the object value, (8) can be transformed into a constrained optimization problem as, (9) { arg p max ( p \u03a6 1 p T ) s . t . p \u03a6 2 p T = 1 Through introducing the Lagrange multiplier, the objective function can be rewritten as, (10) L ( p ; \u03bb ) = p \u03a6 1 p T \u2212 \u03bb ( p \u03a6 2 p T \u2212 1 ) By taking the derivative of (10) with respect to p under the condition \u2202 L \u2202 p = 0 , the objective projection p can be estimated using the generalized eigenvalue equation as, (11) \u03a6 1 p T = \u03bb \u03a6 2 p T where \u03bb denotes the eigenvalue of the generalized eigenvalue equation, and p is the corresponding eigenvector (Benjamin Blankertz et al., 2007). As for the multiple m spatial filters, (11) can be solved as, (12) \u03a6 2 - 1 \u03a6 1 P T = \u2211 P T where P is a matrix consisting of the eigenvectors of \u03a6 2 - 1 \u03a6 1 and \u2211 = d i a g ( \u03bb 1 , \u03bb 2 , ... , \u03bb m ) with \u03bb being the corresponding singular values. In essence, the mapping is a supervised learning approach to enhance the discriminative spatial network pattern between different conditions. For example, when the most discriminative 3 pairs of DSNP spatial filters are utilized, 6-dimensional DSNP features will be obtained (Benjamin Blankertz et al., 2007; Peng Xu et al., 2011). Specifically, the 3 pairs of DSNP filters comprise a matrix P D S P N = [ p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p 6 ] with each filter being a 12-length or 21-length vector, i.e., P DSNP with a dimension of 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f6 or 21\u202f\u00d7\u202f6. The differentiation abilities of the filters were denoted by the eigenvalues in \u01a9, and the first and last filters corresponding to the largest and smallest eigenvalues consist of the most discriminative DSNP filter pair (Benjamin Blankertz et al., 2008). For a 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f12 or 21\u202f\u00d7\u202f21 adjacency matrix C, the corresponding DSNP feature transformation is (13) F D S N P = log ( var ( P D S N P T C ) ) which results in a vector of length 6 with var (.) denoting the variance operator for the rows of matrix. Therefore, after training, the corresponding spatial filters and the training features can be estimated from the training set. Then based on the DSNP features extracted in the training set, the LDA predictor is trained for each subject as shown in Fig. 3 . Practically, letting X = { x 1 a , x 2 a , ... , x m a , x 1 r , x 2 r , ... , x n r } be the DSNP features from acceptance and rejection responses, the aim of LDA is to find a vector \u03c9 which maximizes (Mika et al., 2002; Ye J and Li, 2005) (14) J ( \u03c9 ) = \u03c9 T S B \u03c9 \u03c9 T S W \u03c9 where (15) S B = \u2211 i = 1 C n i ( \u03bc i \u2212 \u03bc i ) ( \u03bc i \u2212 \u03bc i ) T (16) S W = \u2211 i = 1 C \u2211 x k \u2208 c l a s s \u200bI ( \u03bc i \u2212 x k ) ( \u03bc i \u2212 x k ) T are the between and within class scatter matrices, respectively. Here, \u03bc i represents the expectation of the i-th class, C represents the number of the class, and n i is the samples number of the i-th class and x k the sample of class i. The theory behind maximizing J ( \u03c9 ) is to find a direction which maximizes the projected class means (the numerator) while minimizing the class variance in this direction (the denominator). Based on the DSNP filters and LDA predictor learned from the training set, an online prediction can be performed in Fig. 3(b). Specifically, for the k-th EEG trial that waits for the DSNP-based prediction, three steps need to be taken: calculating the adjacency matrix following (1), using the DSNP filters to extract the DSNP features by (13), and inputting the DSNP features into the trained LDA predictor to get the prediction result of the current trial (Li et al., 2019a). In this study, following the DSNP-based single-trial prediction procedures depicted above, the corresponding response for each trial could be predicated for each subject. Thereafter, the indices including accuracy (ACC), precision, recall, and F-measure (Cao et al., 2018) were calculated for the two EEG data sets to quantitatively evaluate the prediction performance. When the network properties were used for single-trial prediction, the difference from DSNP is that the four network properties were directly calculated from the adjacency matrix for each trial, which was then used to train the LDA predictor using the network properties extracted from the training set, and also served for the prediction for the trials in the testing set. Similar to the prediction based on network properties, the ERP amplitude based prediction utilizes the MFN features extracted from the training set to train the LDA predictor. 2.4.6 Statistical analysis In the current study, paired t-tests were utilized to quantify the differences in network topology and network properties between the acceptance and rejection responses. To reveal the statistical prediction performances of different methods (i.e., ERP, network properties and DSNP based approaches), analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare these three methods. 3 Results The performance of our proposed online single-trial prediction relied heavily on the ability of the DSNP filters to reliably extract the discriminative spatial network patterns between different conditions. Fig. 4 (b) shows the differential network patterns between the rejection and acceptance responses in the training set for one subject, where the red and blue lines denote the edges with the significantly stronger and weaker strengths, respectively (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) for acceptance compared to rejection. However, Fig. 4(c) does not show the significant differences in the corresponding network properties. By contrast, Fig. 4(a) illustrates the pair with the most discriminative DSNP filters, where the nodes shown to have the dense linkages in Fig. 4(b) are emphasized with large values (i.e., marked with either the deep red or deep blue). Fig. 5 then shows the scatter plots of the DSNP features extracted by a pair of the most discriminative DSNP filters in Fig. 4(a) for this subject. Following the procedure in Fig. 3, we used ERP amplitudes, the four network properties and DSNP features to perform the single-trial prediction of decision response for each subject. As shown in Table 1, when ERP amplitudes were utilized, the prediction accuracies only achieved 0.46\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05 and 0.48\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.03 for two datasets. When network properties were used, the prediction accuracies achieved 0.62\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12 and 0.65\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.17 for two datasets. Moreover, for the acceptance condition in both datasets, the LDA-based predictor achieved (0.58\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.16 and 0.65\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.17) precision, (0.55\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.23 and 0.67\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.18) recall, and (0.56\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.18 and 0.65\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.16) F-measure. Compared to the performance of ERP amplitudes and network properties, the DSNP consistently achieved significantly (p\u202f<\u202f0.01) higher accuracies of 0.88\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.09 and 0.90\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.10 for the two datasets, respectively. Concretely, for the acceptance condition, the LDA-based predictor with DSPN feature achieved precision of 0.87\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.10 and 0.87\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12, recall of 0.95\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.07 and 0.93\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.09, and F-measure of 0.91\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.08 and 0.90\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.09 for the two datasets. The performed ANOVA test revealed that DSNP based approaches showed statistical performance improvement compared to both the ERP and network properties based approaches (p\u202f<\u202f0.01). Specifically investigating the performances among the three fair conditions, Table 2 consistently shows that the LDA-based predictor could achieve an accuracy above 0.84 accuracy across the three conditions for the two datasets. To further investigate the variability of single-trial prediction performance across subjects, we then plotted the prediction accuracies of subjects achieved by DSNP for each dataset in Fig. 6 , which indeed showed the huge variability across subjects (i.e., 0.74\u20131.00 for amplifier-1 and 0.66\u20131.00 for amplifier-2). We also found that most of the subjects had prediction accuracies over 0.80 (11/14 for amplifier-1, 17/20 for amplifier-2). 4 Discussion This study established a framework for the online single-trial prediction of an individual decision response using single-trial EEG. Given that the brain involves different networks to process the related information when subjects perform the varied decision responses, we specifically constructed the single-trial EEG network, and developed an effective approach (i.e., DSNP) to extract the discriminative spatial network pattern for the decision prediction. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the comparison of brain networks demonstrates the existence of the large network topology difference between the acceptance and rejection. The long-range frontal-parietal/occipital linkages in Fig. 4 (b) indicated that the two regions are important for the decision-making, which has been validated by various fMRI or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies (Dodds et al., 2010; Shao et al., 2016; Wittkuhn et al., 2017). Decision making involves the binary choice to either accept or reject an option based upon two competing attributes, i.e., the choice\u2019s anticipated costs and benefits. Previous studies have found that some participants prefer to reject offers for the rule of fairness to punish the proposer\u2019s unfair performance by conveying disgust and anger, and others could make an acceptance for reciprocity and benefits (Calder et al., 2001; Mujcic and Leibbrandt, 2017). The unfair condition, in particular, could induce conflict in the human between cognition (\u201caccept\u201d) related to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and emotion (\u201creject\u201d) involving the anterior insula (Sanfey et al., 2003). The frontal cortex is widely known to be involved in human choice behavior, providing individuals with the ability to encode expected value representation and inhibition of proponent responses (Munakata et al., 2011). And the decision-making activations beginning in the visual cortex located in the occipital cortex and spreading to the prefrontal regions has also been revealed by a study with magneto-encephalography (Pearson and Platt, 2012). Motivated from the spatial network topology difference revealed in both this and previous studies, we used the network topology information to perform the single-trial EEG based prediction. However, different from the significant difference on spatial network patterns, the statistical network properties did not exhibit the obvious difference between the two responses in Fig. 4 (c). Specifically investigating the network topology in Fig. 4(b), both stronger (increased) and weaker (decreased) linkages could be found between the two responses, which accordingly alleviated the significant differences of the network properties between the two conditions and thereby might account for the insignificant difference in Fig. 4 (c). In essence, the challenge for the online prediction in current work is largely dependent on the signal quality of single trial EEG and the ERP component. Considering that the background noise in EEG is characterized with the relatively high frequency band, and the ERP components are reflected in the relatively low frequency band, to guarantee that a relatively stable MFN related EEG can be provided for the subsequent network analysis, we firstly used the 1\u201320\u202fHz band-pass filter as proposed in previous decision making studies to filter the EEG signals, which has been proved to be able to refine the MFN related information well (Hewig et al., 2011; Martin and Potts, 2011). Although the obvious spatial topology differences between the two responses could be observed, when the single-trial EEG is used to predict the response, the signal-to-noise rate is rather low, and it is difficult to extract the reliable spatial network patterns for single-trial prediction. Therefore, based on the constructed single-trial network, we specifically developed a supervised learning method (i.e., DSNP) to enhance the spatial difference of the single-trial network topology. The scalp topographies of the two DSNP filters in Fig. 4(a) demonstrated the working mechanism of DSNP. Specifically, combining the scalp topographies in Fig. 4(a) with the spatial difference of network topology in Fig. 4(b), the spatial filters estimated by DSNP imposed the large weights on the nodes experiencing denser linkage differences between the two responses while giving smaller weights to those nodes with fewer of linkages, which thus enhanced the importance of these nodes, i.e., enlarging the spatial topology difference of these nodes. The scatter plots of DSNP features corresponding to the two DSNP filters in Fig. 5 further demonstrate that the proposed DSNP can extract the reliable features for both training and the online prediction. First, the training features represented by the asterisk are distributed with a clear LDA boundary. Second, the testing features derived from the learned DSNP filters show a similar distribution to the training features, i.e., most of the testing samples marked with circles are correctly distributed in the areas separated by the LDA boundary. This good separation characteristic of DSNP features revealed in Fig. 5 resulted in the better prediction performance in Table 1. When compared to the relatively lower performance of ERP amplitudes (i.e., 0.46 and 0.48) and network properties (i.e., 0.62 and 0.65), LDA based on the DSNP features achieved prediction accuracies of 0.88 and 0.90 for the two datasets. Although the MFN amplitude is an important index in decision-making processing, the MFN amplitudes could not always promise the satisfying classification performance in identifying distinct responses of decision. We assumed that this might be attributed to the huge variability of ERP across trials for each individual, and moreover the mere MFN amplitude could not reflect the information exchange among various brain areas, which had been proven to be important to fulfill the information processing during decision-making. Therefore, MFN amplitude based prediction achieves lower prediction performance compared to the two network based predictions. The difference between the network properties and DSNP features was consistent with that in Fig. 4, i.e., the significant difference of spatial network topology exhibited between the two responses while the insignificant difference for the network properties. In essence, while the subject will inevitably encounter the different conditions in the actual decision-making, he or she might have different responses. The prediction performances of the three fairness conditions (i.e., extremely unfair, moderately unfair and fair) further demonstrated that the proposed DSNP can reliably predict the individual responses in all three conditions with an accuracy above 0.84 for both datasets. As for the online decision prediction, a challenging problem is the large variability across subjects, which may hamper the practical application of the prediction system. Just as revealed in Fig. 6, the prediction accuracy largely varied across subjects (i.e., 0.74\u20131.00 for amplifier-1; 0.66\u20131.00 for amplifier-2), which has also been observed in other online prediction systems, such as brain-computer interface (Li et al., 2010; Long et al., 2012b; Zhang et al., 2015, 2016) and emotion recognition (Li et al., 2019b; Ricciardi et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2017). Although the huge variability existed, 28 out of the 34 subjects acquired single-trial prediction accuracies above 0.80. Even in those subjects with poor performance, the lowest accuracy was 0.66, which was much higher than the random accuracy of 0.50. These performances consistently demonstrated the proposed DSNP can availably extract the discriminative spatial network information to predict the decision responses for most subjects and then achieves a satisfying online prediction performance based on the single-trial EEG. Moreover, relative to previous studies, the EEG-based computational intelligence framework could effectively capture the variability of a single trial and also reflect the varied individual states. Another advantage is the generalized ability of the DSNP to be used various datasets from different EEG systems in the actual application. In this study, we utilized two datasets recorded from different amplifiers to predict the responses between acceptance and rejection based upon the single-trial EEG. The similar accuracies (0.88 for amplifier-1 and 0.90 for amplifier-2) between the two datasets can verify each other and provide credible evidence for the generalized merit of the proposed approach. In this study, to simulate the online single-trial prediction, we divided the recording EEGs into the training and online prediction sets, where the former N/2 trials serve as the training set, and the remaining N/2 trials belong to the testing set. This strategy is close to the actual online prediction condition where subjects are required to perform the training before online prediction, then based on the trained model (i.e., LDA predictor and DSNP filters), the online single-trial prediction is made. When performing the online prediction, the time consumption needs to be considered. In the online prediction of current work, the network construction for the single trial EEG is determinative for the time consumption. As for the adopted coherence based network analysis, it has been proved to have the low computation complexity (Chorlian et al., 2009; Thatcher et al., 1986) and can satisfy the time requirement for the online prediction in current work. 5 Conclusion Compared to previous studies focusing on the averaged measurements over multiple trials neglecting information about trial-to-trial variability, the current work captured this variability during the decision process and could also reflect the varied individual states of decision responses. In summary, based on the single-trial scalp UG-EEG, the proposed DSNP-based single-trial prediction method could reliably predict the instantaneous decision responses during decision-making, irrespective of the amplifiers used in the experiment. The prediction capacity was based on the inherent and implicit spatial information in brain EEG networks derived from single-trial EEG during decision-making. The DSNP helps us to discover the implicit information related to decision-making and therefore to create an intelligent decision system in the practical application as well.

There has been increasing interest in being able to predict an individual\u2019s decision-making response (i.e., acceptance or rejection). We proposed an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based computational intelligence framework to predict individual responses. Specifically, the discriminative spatial network pattern (DSNP), a supervised learning approach, was applied to single-trial EEG data to extract the DSNP feature from the single-trial brain network. A linear discriminate analysis (LDA) trained on the DSNP features was then used to predict the individual response trial-by-trial. To verify the performance of the proposed DSNP, we recruited two independent subject groups, and recorded the EEGs using two types of EEG systems. The performances of the trial-by-trial predictors achieved an accuracy of 0.88\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.09 for the first dataset, and 0.90\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.10 for the second dataset. These trial-by-trial prediction performances suggested that individual responses could be predicted trial-by-trial by using the specific pattern of single-trial EEG networks, and our proposed method has the potential to establish the biologically inspired artificial intelligence decision system.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2020-02-01", "openaccessUserLicense":
