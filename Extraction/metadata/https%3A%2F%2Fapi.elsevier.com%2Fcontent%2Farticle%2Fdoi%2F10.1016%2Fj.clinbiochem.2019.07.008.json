ANN simulates neuron learning procedures and it could provide good diagnostic performances in this complex and heterogeneous disease compared with linear regression analysis. Design and Methods: In our study, a new set of lipid peroxidation compounds were determined in urine and plasma samples from patients diagnosed with early Alzheimer Disease (n\u202f=\u202f70) and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f26) by means of ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass-spectrometry. Then, a model based on ANN was developed to classify groups of participants. Results: The diagnostic performances obtained using an ANN model for each biological matrix were compared with the corresponding linear regression model based on partial least squares (PLS), and with the non-linear (radial and polynomial) support vector machine (SVM) models. Better accuracy, in terms of receiver operating characteristic-area under curve (ROC-AUC), was obtained for the ANN models (ROC-AUC 0.882 in plasma and 0.839 in urine) than for PLS and SVM models. Conclusion: Lipid peroxidation and ANN constitute a useful approach to establish a reliable diagnosis when the prognosis is complex, multidimensional and non-linear.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Alzheimer Disease"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial neural network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Mass spectrometry"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Partial least squares"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Plasma"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Lipid peroxidation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Urine"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009912018314012", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009912018314012", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85068918314", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85068918314", "pubmed-id": "31319065", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85068918314", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20190715", "$": "2019-07-15"}}}}}
