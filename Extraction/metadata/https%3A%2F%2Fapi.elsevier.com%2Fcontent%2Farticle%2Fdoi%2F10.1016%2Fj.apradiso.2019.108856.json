They can be deduced from neutron spectrum, which is usually measured by multisphere system with proper unfolding methods. Novel unfolding methods on the basis of artificial intelligence, mainly artificial neural networks (ANNs), have been researched and developed. However, without normalization on network inputs, ANNs can not be applied to accommodate demands of various neutron field measurements for neutron spectrum unfolding in practice, because the neutron spectra for training the ANNs are mostly extracted from IAEA (2001), the integrals of which over neutron energy are unit fluences.
