Of these patients, 987 were evaluable. Results were stratified by the World Health Organization BMI category. Multivariate linear and logistic regression analysis was used to model the operating time, length of stay, positive surgical margins, and noncurable cancer.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  Of the 987 patients, 563 (57%) were overweight and 193 (19.6%) were obese. Of the 193 obese patients, 152 (15.4%) had a BMI of 30 to\u00a0<35 kg/m2 (class I obesity), 28 (2.8%) a BMI of 35\u00a0to\u00a0<40 kg/m2 (class II), and 13 (1.3%) a BMI of\u00a0\u226540 kg/m2 (class III). No differences were found in the estimated blood loss, complications, PSM, pathologic stage, or biochemical recurrence across the BMI categories (6-month median follow-up). However, pelvic lymph node dissection was more commonly omitted and the nerve-sparing score was inferior in the obese men. On multivariate analysis, a higher BMI was a significant predictor of a longer operating time.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion\n                  Obese men can safely undergo laparoscopic radical prostatectomy or robot-assisted radical prostatectomy, although the ability to perform excellent nerve sparing appears to decrease with increasing obesity. Nevertheless, obese men can expect perioperative and early oncologic outcomes comparable to those of normal weight men without an increased risk of perioperative complications.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0090429513006249", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090429513006249", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84883248373", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84883248373", "pubmed-id": "23859532", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84883248373", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20130713", "$": "2013-07-13"}}}}}
