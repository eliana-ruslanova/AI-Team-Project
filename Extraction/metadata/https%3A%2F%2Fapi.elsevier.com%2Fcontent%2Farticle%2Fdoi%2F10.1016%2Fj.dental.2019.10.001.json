We document the (a) presidents, (b) meeting history, (c) membership growth, and (d) development of special awards through 2019 with the recent creation of the ADM Marshall Post-Doctoral Award.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  There are 36 years of recent ADM history, 42 international meetings, membership growth to 400 individuals from 15 countries, service of 19 presidents, Paffenbarger annual Awardees since 1989, induction of >200 fellows, and recognition of the first winner of Marshall Post-Doctoral Award in 2018.
