In Arabidopsis thaliana, the enzyme is a heterotetramer, containing two small subunits encoded by the APS1 gene and two large subunits encoded by the APL1-4 genes. TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes) of a chemically mutagenised population of A. thaliana plants identified 33 novel mutations in the APS1 gene, including 21 missense mutations in the protein coding region. High throughput measurements using a robotised cycling assay showed that maximal AGPase activity in the aps1 mutants varied from <15 to 117% of wild type (WT), and that the kinetic properties of the enzyme were altered in several lines, indicating a role for the substituted amino acid residues in catalysis or substrate binding. These results validate the concept of using such a platform for efficient high-throughput screening of very large populations of mutants, natural accessions or introgression lines. AGPase was estimated to have a flux control coefficient of 0.20, indicating that the enzyme exerted only modest control over the rate of starch synthesis in plants grown under short day conditions (8h light/16h dark) with an irradiance of 150\u03bcmolquantam\u22122\n                     s\u22121. Redox activation of the enzyme, via reduction of the intermolecular disulphide bridge between the two small subunits, was increased in several lines. This was sometimes, but not always, associated with a decrease in the abundance of the APS1 protein. In conclusion, the TILLING technique was used to generate an allelic series of aps1 mutants in A. thaliana that revealed new insights into the multi-layered regulation of AGPase. These mutants offer some advantages over the available loss-of-function mutants, e.g. adg1, for investigating the effects of subtle changes in the enzyme's activity on the rate of starch synthesis.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Redox regulation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Starch"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "TILLING"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Trehalose-6-phosphate"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0176161711000733", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176161711000733", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "79958748655", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-79958748655", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79958748655", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20110222", "$": "2011-02-22"}}}}}
