this study. Frozen embryos at day 5 or day 6 post-fertilization were thawed and allowed to recover for 24 h to become day 6 or day 7, staining or culturing until day 12 as human embryo attachment cultures.

Figure 7 Proposed Model Human PGCs are specified beginning at day 12. Based on the in vitro germline trajectory, we propose that hPGCs originate from a lineage-primed TFAP2A + progenitor at around day 11 which is specified from a transitional pluripotent state that shares characteristics with pre- and post-implantation epiblasts that we have called \u201cgerminal pluripotency.\u201d TFAP2A + progenitors have the potential for hPGC specification and also for differentiation of somatic cells, including amnion and gastrulating cells. TFAP2C functions at the critical point of hPGC specification to directly regulate expression of the human germ cell fate determinant SOX17, while simultaneously preventing germline cells from crossing Weismann\u2019s barrier to become somatic cells.

The foundation of this model is the quality of the first progenitors called primordial germ cells (PGCs), which in vivo are specified during the peri-implantation window of human development. Here, we show that human PGC (hPGC) specification begins at day 12 post-fertilization. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of hPGC-like cells (hPGCLCs) differentiated from pluripotent stem cells, we discovered that hPGCLC specification involves resetting pluripotency toward a transitional state with shared characteristics between naive and primed pluripotency, followed by differentiation into lineage-primed TFAP2A+ progenitors. Applying the germline trajectory to TFAP2C mutants reveals that TFAP2C functions in the TFAP2A+ progenitors upstream of PRDM1 to regulate the expression of SOX17. This serves to protect hPGCLCs from crossing the Weismann\u2019s barrier to adopt somatic cell fates and, therefore, is an essential mechanism for successfully initiating in vitro gametogenesis. Graphical Abstract Highlights \u2022 Human germline cell specification begins from a transitional pluripotent state \u2022 Human primordial germ cells are specified from lineage-primed progenitors \u2022 Lineage-primed TFAP2A progenitors have gastrulating and amnion cell identity \u2022 TFAP2C regulates SOX17 at the point of human primordial germ cell specification Using genetics, genomics, and single-cell RNA-seq, Chen et al. characterize the human germline trajectory, revealing two pluripotent cell transitions during primordial germ cell specification. They reveal the identity of primordial germ cell progenitors and show that TFAP2C prevents gastrulation and amnion-like fate at the point of primordial germ cell specification. Keywords stem cells germ cells pluripotency TFAP2A TFAP2C single cell RNA-sequencing Introduction More than a century ago, the German biologist August Weismann proposed the germplasm theory of heredity in which he postulated that germ cells of animals contain an essential hereditary substance that passes from one generation to the next, now known to be DNA (Weismann, 1893). As a part of his theory, the concept of \u201cWeismann\u2019s barrier\u201d was also established (Weismann 1893). This is not a physical barrier but a model that proposes that hereditary information flows only through germline cells and not somatic cells of the body. This is important because without germline specification, the outcome is infertility, a disease that affects around 10% of humans of reproductive age. Understanding or possibly overcoming infertility requires a human model that recapitulates all stages of germline cell development, including how Weismann\u2019s barrier is first established with the specification of primordial germ cells (PGCs) and somatic cells in the embryo. Human pluripotent stem cells and the differentiation of PGC-like cells (PGCLCs) serve this purpose. Specification of PGCs in animals involves two different strategies. One involves pre-formation, which occurs in the model organisms Xenopus, zebrafish, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans (Extavour and Akam, 2003; Williamson and Lehmann, 1996). In these organisms, rare cells of the newly fertilized embryo inherit molecules produced by the female germline (oocyte), bestowing upon these embryonic cells the maintenance of germline cell identity. In contrast, cells that do not inherit these maternal molecules from the oocyte after fertilization become somatic cells, thus irreversibly crossing Weismann\u2019s barrier and losing the capacity to contribute to the germline. For animals that specify germ cells, each generation by induction, such as mouse, pig, horse, rabbit, and human, Weismann\u2019s barrier encompasses an additional step, which involves an initial fate restriction from totipotency to pluripotency, and then around the time of embryo implantation and gastrulation, PGCs are induced from peri-implantation cell precursors (Magn\u00fasd\u00f3ttir and Surani, 2014; Tang et al., 2016). The identity of these precursors in humans is completely unknown. As PGC specification progresses, the remaining embryonic precursors cross Weismann\u2019s barrier to become somatic cells. In mouse, where mouse PGC (mPGC) induction is well studied, it has been reported that mPGCs are induced at embryonic day 6.5 (E6.5) by bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) signaling to the Wnt family member 3 (WNT3)-primed epiblast cells (Ohinata et al., 2009). The maintenance of germline identity downstream of BMP4 signaling involves the transcription factor network, including transcription factors (TFs) PRDM14, PRDM1 (also known as BLIMP1), and TFAP2C, with PRDM1 functioning upstream of TFAP2C to repress somatic cell fate and maintain mPGC identity (Magn\u00fasd\u00f3ttir and Surani, 2014; Magn\u00fasd\u00f3ttir et al., 2013; Nakaki et al., 2013; Ohinata et al., 2005; Weber et al., 2010; Yamaji et al., 2008). Recent studies using the differentiation of human PGCLCs (hPGCLCs) from human pluripotent stem cells have revealed that the TF network required to specify and maintain human PGC (hPGC) fate is different from the mouse (Chen et al., 2017; Irie et al., 2015; Kojima et al., 2017, Sasaki et al., 2015). For example, SOX17 is required for hPGCLC specification, whereas in mouse it is not (Irie et al., 2015). In mPGCs, TFAP2C functions downstream of PRDM1 to repress somatic cell differentiation genes (Ohinata et al., 2005). However, in hPGCLC differentiation from PRDM1 mutants, TFAP2C expression levels are unaffected in the PRDM1 mutant hPGCLCs relative to controls (Sasaki et al., 2015). One human-specific role for TFAP2C in hPGCLCs involves the opening of naive-specific enhancers and the acquisition of naive-like pluripotency (Chen et al., 2018). An alternate but not necessarily mutually exclusive role for TFAP2C is to repress somatic cell gene expression in PRDM1-positive hPGCLC precursors and, therefore, to keep cells within Weismann\u2019s barrier (Kojima et al., 2017). However, this result is predicated on the assumption that PRDM1 is expressed in hPGCLC precursors before TFAP2C, and also that PRDM1 is not expressed by the somatic cells of the aggregates. The only way to address this is to evaluate the germline and somatic cell trajectories from the pluripotent state through to the specification of hPGCLCs. Recently, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been widely used to map differentiation trajectories and to discover new cell types without known markers (Poirion et al., 2016; Stegle et al., 2015). Capitalizing on this approach to identify the precursors of hPGCs in the peri-implantation window, we performed scRNA-seq of more than 100,000 individual cells during hPGCLC specification to model the molecular events in hPGC specification by using an adapted developmental trajectory detection algorithm named time constraint URD (tcURD). Through this work, we uncovered the human germline trajectory and discovered the identity of potential peri-implantation progenitors for hPGCs. Results Tracing hPGCs during Peri-implantation Embryogenesis and in hESC-based hPGCLC Induction Using human embryo attachment culture (Deglincerti et al., 2016; Shahbazi et al., 2016), we evaluated whether ex vivo hPGCs could be identified before primitive streak formation and, therefore, the feasibility of using the human embryo attachment culture model to identify hPGC progenitors. Under California state law, human embryo attachment culture is legally allowed up to day 12 post-fertilization, which is 2 days before the International Consensus of day 14 or before primitive streak formation. To trace ex vivo hPGCs, we first confirmed the co-expression of NANOG, SOX17, and TFAP2C (N/S/T) as being restricted to hPGCs (Gkountela et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2015; Tang et al., 2015) (Figures S1A and S1B). Next, we thawed a total of 127 day 5 or day 6 post-fertilization human blastocysts; twenty-four h after thawing, these blastocysts were considered day 6 or day 7, respectively. From this cohort, we performed whole-mount immunofluorescence followed by confocal imaging and 3D reconstruction of 78 human embryos from day 6 to day 12 (Figure 1 A; Table S1). We discovered N/S/T triple-positive putative ex vivo hPGCs at day 12 post-fertilization in 2/26 embryos (Figures 1B and S1C; Video S1; Table S2). N/S/T triple-positive cells were not identified at any of the reminaing 52 embryos at either days 10\u201311 or days 6\u20137 (Figures S1D and S1E). Instead, in the pre-implantation blastocyst, the TFAP2C protein was expressed in all cells, whereas NANOG- and SOX17-positive cells were mutually exclusive, marking the pre-implantation epiblast (Pre-EPI) and hypoblast cells, respectively (Figure S1E). Taken together, these observations suggest that hPGC specification defined as N/S/T triple-positive cells in the peri-implantation embryo begins at around day 12 post-fertilization in humans before primitive streak formation. Video S1. D12 Human Embryo Stained for TFAP2C (Purple), SOX17 (Yellow), and NANOG (Cyan), Related to Figure 1 Given that less than 10% of human blastocysts at day 12 had evidence of N/S/T triple-positive hPGCs, it would be difficult to discriminate the identity of hPGC precursors in this system without using large numbers of intact human embryos consented to research. Therefore, we used the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into hPGCLCs by generating disorganized 3D aggregates in the presence of BMP4 and other cytokines (Sasaki et al.,2015) (Figure 1C). We used the two-step method of differentiation starting from primed pluripotent stem cells and first differentiating through an incipient mesoderm-like cell (iMELC) intermediate, as this approach has been successfully used by different groups to generate hPGCLCs from primed hESCs and hiPSCs (Sasaki et al.,2015; Chen et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018; Yokobayashi et al., 2017; Kojima et al., 2017). Given the known variability in hPGCLC competency between independently derived pluripotent stem cell lines (Chen et al., 2017; Yokobayashi et al., 2017), we designed the experiment to evaluate hPGCLC specification in a highly germline competent hESC line (UCLA2) and a hESC line with significantly lower competency (UCLA1) (Figures 1D and 1E). These hESC lines were derived under identical conditions from individual blastocysts that were provided by the same embryo donors (Diaz Perez et al., 2012). We discovered rare and yet reproducible N/S/T triple-positive hPGCLCs at day 1 of aggregate differentiation after exposure to BMP4 in both cell lines, with an increase in the percentage of triple-positive hPGCLCs emerging at day 2 in the highly competent UCLA2 line relative to UCLA1 (Figure 1F). To better characterize the dynamics of germline specification, we applied scRNA-seq with 10x Genomics to hESCs, iMeLCs (incipient mesoderm-like cells), and aggregate cells at days 1\u20134 with two biological replicates for both UCLA1 and UCLA2 cell lines (Zheng et al., 2017) (Table S3). In total, we sequenced 85,309 cells with high quality to uncover the germline trajectory and explored the progenitors involved in establishing germline cell fate (Table S4). To identify the cell populations at each time point, we used canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for batch correction of the two biological replicates at each time point within each cell line and applied uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) to visualize the distribution of single cells throughout the entire differentiation time course (Figures 1G, 1H, and S1F). Specified hPGCLCs were indicated by the germline-specific gene NANOS3 (Gkountela et al., 2013; Butler et al., 2018; McInnes et al., 2018) (Figures 1G and 1H). Consistently, more NANOS3-positive hPGCLCs were present in UCLA2 than UCLA1. Interestingly, we observed clear branches of connected cell clusters following the temporal order of PGCLC differentiation in the 2D maps from both UCLA1 and UCLA2 (Figures 1G and 1H). Mapping the Human Germline Trajectory by scRNA-seq To precisely map the human germline trajectory, we first identified cells quadruple-positive for NANOG, SOX17, TFAP2C, and the germline-specific gene NANOS3 (with log-transformed-normalized unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts of >0.5 for NANOG, SOX17, TFAP2C, and NANOS3) in UCLA1 and UCLA2 as hPGCLCs (Figures 2 A, 2B, S2A, and S2B). The emergence of distinct quadruple cells was identified at day 1 and persistent during day 2 to day 4 differentiation (Figures 2A and 2B). These observations indicate that hPGCLC specification occurs within the first 24\u201348 h of BMP exposure, and UCLA2 responds more rapidly and efficiently relative to UCLA1. To identify differentiation trajectories unbiasedly without using previously known lineage markers, we applied the computational trajectory detection method URD to the scRNA-seq data (Farrell et al., 2018). URD is mainly built on connecting cells with nearest neighbors in terms of transcriptome similarity under the assumption that the transcriptome of a cell changes progressively during differentiation. It has been reported that hPGCs and hPGCLCs regain pluripotency after specification (Chen et al., 2018), which may connect the specified hPGCLCs to hESCs directly. To avoid these possible artificial connections, we adapted URD with a constraint that cells could only be connected to its neighbors from the same, the previous, or the next time points (STAR Methods), and we applied this time constraint URD (tcURD) to predict germline trajectory (Figuress 2C, 2D, S2A, and S2B). This analysis revealed that in the less-competent UCLA1 hESC line, a subset of iMeLCs (yellow) had already exited from the branched cellular trajectory, to beome cells equivalent to visceral/yolk sac endoderm (Figure 2C). However, in UCLA2, all iMeLCs retain competency to differentiate toward either hPGCLCs or somatic cells including endoderm as well as other peri-implantation lineages (Figure 2D). Therefore, unlike UCLA1, at the time of BMP4 exposure, more UCLA2 iMeLCs are still within Weismann\u2019s barrier and are, therefore, competent for hPGCLC specification. Notably, PRDM1 is not restricted only to germline trajectory but is also present in endoderm cells (Figures S2C and S2D). To map the somatic lineages differentiating together with the hPGCLCs in the 3D disorganized aggregates, we compared our differentiation trajectories to the cynomolgus (cyno) macaque per-implantation embryo scRNA-seq datasets (Nakamura et al., 2016) and amnion-like cells (AMLCs) from 3D embryo models (Zheng et al., 2019). Basically, we identified the signature genes for each annotated cell type in cyno scRNA-seq data and AMLCs, followed by calculating the signature score in each human cell across the germline trajectory to score the ends of the branches at day 4 (STAR Methods). This analysis revealed that the somatic cells in the disorganized aggregates include yolk sac endoderm/primitive endoderm and a variety of somatic cell types equivalent to trophoblast (TE), gastrulating cells (Gast), amnion, and extra-embryonic mesenchyme (EXMC) (Figures 2C and 2D). This result indicates that the 3D disorganized aggregates from independently derived hESC lines have the potential to differentiate into a variety of peri-implantation cell types together with the germline cells in the presence of BMP4. Given there was only one germline specification trajectory along with other somatic lineages (Figures 2C, 2D, S2C, and S2D) in both UCLA1 and UCLA2, we used the trajectory from each cell line to trace the peri-implantation embryonic progenitors to the human germline. Figures S2 hPGCLCs Are Specified through a Pluripotent State with Both Naive and Primed Characteristics Next, we focused only on the germline trajectory. Using pseudotime analysis of the cells extracted from the germline trajectory, we first explored the dynamics of hPGC specification genes (NANOG, SOX17, TFAP2C, and NANOS3) together with the pluripotent TFs SOX2 and OCT4 (Also known as POU5F1). OCT4 is expressed in all cells of the trajectory. NANOG is also expressed throughout the germline trajectory with notable downregulation toward the end of day 1, followed by a subsequent upregulation at day 2 during hPGCLC specification. SOX2 repression in the germline trajectory begins at the time of iMeLC induction and is more pronounced at the end of day 1, concomitant with upregulation of the germline specifier SOX17. TFAP2C expression was dynamic in the germline trajectories of UCLA1 and UCLA2, being upregulated during day 1 in UCLA1 and UCLA2 (Figures 3 A and S3A). To map the in vitro germline trajectory back to in vivo embryogenesis, we again used the scRNA-seq data of cyno embryos (Nakamura et al., 2016), with a focus on the pluripotent stages of development, including inner cell mass (ICM), Pre-EPIs, post-implantation early epiblasts (PostE-EPIs), and post-implantation late epiblasts (PostL-EPIs). As previously reported, we discovered that undifferentiated UCLA2 (Figure 3B) and UCLA1 (Figure S3B) hESCs highly expressed the signatures of the cyno PostE-EPI and PostL-EPI with primed pluripotency (Nakamura et al., 2016). However, to our surprise, the iMeLCs within the germline trajectory of UCLA2 and UCLA1 reset their pluripotency status to a state that correlates with both cyno ICM and Pre-EPI (naive) and PostE-EPI and PostL-EPI (primed) (Figures 3B and S3B). This result suggests that in 24 h of exposure to the cytokines in iMeLC media, the hESCs initiate a partial reversion toward naive-like pluripotency states found in the pre-implantation primate embryo while retaining primed state characteristics. To confirm the pluripotent state in germline trajectory iMeLCs, we also defined naive and primed signatures by using scRNA-seq data of human naive and primed hESCs (Messmer et al., 2019). Consistently, iMeLCs in the germline trajectory showed signatures of both naive and primed hESCs (Figures 3C and S3C). Thus, we termed the transitional pluripotent state of iMeLCs in germline trajectory as a \u201cgerminal pluripotent state,\u201d as they are competent to give rise to hPGCs in addition to somatic lineages (Figure 2C and 2D). Furthermore, we discovered TFs that are enriched in germinal pluripotent cells which are expressed at lower levels in naive and primed pluripotent states (Figure 3D). To find the in vivo counterparts of embryonic cells in this transitional germinal pluripotent state, we applied scRNA-seq to day 12 human embryos. We identified 13 cells annotated as epiblasts based on the cyno embryonic cells (Nakamura et al., 2016) (Figure 3E). Within these 13 cells, we discovered 4 cells that show signatures of primed hESCs, naive hESCs, and iMeLCs in germline trajectory, indicating they are possible in vivo embryonic cells with germinal pluripoteny (Figure 3F). Human PGC Specification Transitions through a TFAP2A + Progenitor with Both Amnion and Gastrulation Signatures There are currently two hypotheses for the origin of hPGCs in amniotes with bilaminar embryonic discs. Using the non-human primate cyno macaque as a model, cynoPGCs are identified in the amnion at E11 (Sasaki et al., 2016). However, in the porcine (p), porcine PGCs (pPGCs) were first identified in pre-mesendoderm cells in the region of the posterior primitive streak (Kobayashi et al., 2017). To further map the human germline trajectory back to in vivo embryogenesis, we next tracked the putative amnion-related genes (TFAP2A, GATA3, and CDX2) in the germline trajectory (Shao et al., 2017a, 2017b). Strikingly, TFAP2A is upregulated for approximately 24 h during day 1, together with GATA3 and CDX2 (Figures 4A and 4B). Repression of TFAP2A, GATA3, and CDX2 genes then mark the beginning of hPGCLC specification. Genes related to gastrulation, EOMES and T (also known as BRACHYURY), were highly and transiently upregulated at the beginning of day 1 in the UCLA2 germline trajectory. In contrast, the less-competent UCLA1 line exhibited only modest upregulation of EOMES and T (Figures 4A and 4B). Notably, TFAP2A is also expressed in gastrulating cells during cyno embryogenesis (Figure S4A). These observations suggest that hPGC specification originates from a transient population of TFAP2A-expressing progenitors that exhibit both amnion- and gastrulation-like TF identity, with cells exhibiting more TFAP2A + gastrulation-like identity in the earlier stages of UCLA2 relative to UCLA1 germline trajectories. Given that clear clusters of NANOG/SOX17/TFAP2C/NANOS3 quadruple-positive cells are first shown at day 2 (Figures 2A and 2B), we termed the day 1 cells in germline trajectory as germline progenitors. To better infer the relationships of the D1 progenitor cells to the peri-implantation embryo, we utilized the scRNA-seq dataset of the recently published organized 3D human embryo model, with a focus on the AMLCs and day 2 (D2) hPGCLCs. The 3D embryo model was created by exposing the H9 hESC line to BMP4 for 48 h by using microfluidics, which results in the generation of posteriorized embryonic-like sacs with AMLCs, pre-gastrula cells, and hPGCLCs (Zheng et al., 2019). For gastrulation cell identity, we utilized the annotated gastrulating cells from cyno peri-implantation embryo (Sasaki et al., 2016). (Figures 4C and S3B). This analysis reveals that TFAP2A + day 1 progenitors are strongly enriched in cells with gastrulation identity throughout day 1 and that AMLC identity is also particularly strong at the end of day 1 just prior to N/S/T and NANOS3 positive hPGCLC specification (Figures 4C and S4B). Notably the D2 hPGCLCs from the 3D embryo model strongly resemble the day 2 to day 3 hPGCLCs in the germline trajectory, whereas the early cynoPGCs (ecPGCs) resemble day 4 hPGCLCs generated in the aggregates (Figures 4C and S4B). Given that the hPGCLCs from the 3D embryo model at 48 h map the closest to the day 2\u2013day 3 hPGCLCs in the germline trajectory from the 3D-disorganized aggregates, this result suggests that regardless of whether 3D-modeled embryos or 3D-disorganized aggregates are used to generate hPGCLCs, the identity of the hPGCLC 48 h (or 2 days) after BMP4 exposure is very similar. Given that the current approach for creating 3D-modeled embryos can only be sustained for 48\u201372 h before the system collapses, the disorganized aggregates provide a slightly extended opportunity to consolidate hPGCLC fate to one that is closer to ecPGCs found in vivo. (Figures 4D and S4C). TFAP2C Functions Upstream of SOX17 in Human Germline Specification Next, we focused on the cells in the germline trajectory to decipher the gene regulatory network associated with the establishment of hPGC fate. To do this, we first identified germline trajectory differentially expressed genes (gtDEGs) as the union of pseudotime correlated genes, and DEGs across stages in the germline trajectory (STAR Methods). About 3,000 gtDEGs were detected and grouped into 10 and 12 clusters in UCLA1 and UCLA2, respectively, based on their expression profiles across the trajectory (Figures 5 A and S5A). A clear wave of dynamic gene expression was observed in both UCLA1 and UCLA2 from undifferentiated hESCs to hPGCLCs at day 4 (Figures 5A and S5A). To understand the regulatory mechanism, we predicted TFs based on the motif enrichment at the promoter regions of genes in each cluster as upstream regulators (Figures 5A and S5A; STAR Methods). From this analysis, we identified expected TFs known to be responsible for hPGCLC specification, including SOX17, TFAP2C, PRDM1, and EOMES (Figures 5A and S5A). In addition, we identified TFAP2A at day 1\u20132 of aggregate differentiation as well as the TFs ID3, ID4, and TBX3 (Figures 5A and S5A) and others. Notably, germline trajectory TFs shared by UCLA1 and UCLA2 include germline related (TFAP2C, SOX17, and PRDM1), pluripotency related (NANOG, POU5F1, and KLF4), amnion/gastrulation related (TFAP2A, CDX2, and GATA3), and BMP4 signaling related (ID1, ID2, ID3, SMAD6, MSX1, and MSX2) (Figures 5A and S5A; Table S5). An analysis of the TF regulatory network at the time of hPGCLC specification indicates that SOX17 may be a putative target of TFAP2C (Figures 5B and S5B\u2013S5D). To test this, we compared chromatin accessibility measured by ATAC-seq (Chen et al., 2018) and TFAP2C binding measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) in hESCs, iMeLCs, and day 4 aggregates. To identify potential distal regulatory elements, we also performed H3K27ac ChIP-seq in day 4 hPGCLCs isolated using ITGA6/ EPCAM (Figure 5C). We discovered that TFAP2C is bound to the SOX17 promoter in hESCs, iMeLCs, and day 4 cells. However, SOX17 mRNA is only upregulated in hPGCLCs (Figure 5C). This observation suggests that the TFAP2C promoter binding at the SOX17 locus is not sufficient to induce the dynamic upregulation of SOX17 at the time of hPGCLC specification. Integrating the H3K27ac and TFAP2C ChIP-seq data, we propose that although TFAP2C is always bound to the SOX17 promoter, it is the binding of TFAP2C to distal regulatory sites that are also coordinately enriched in H3K27ac in hPGCLCs to enable SOX17 expression at the point of hPGCLC specification (Figure 5C). TFAP2C Safeguards Germ Cell Fate in the Germline Trajectory TFAP2C is critical for hPGCLC formation but is not necessary for hESC self-renewal or the differentiation of iMeLCs (Chen et al., 2018; Kojima et al., 2017). To evaluate the role of TFAP2C in the germline trajectory, we performed scRNA-seq of TFAP2C \u2212/\u2212 cells at 6 time points (hESCs, iMeLCs, aggregates at days 1 to 4, 19,808 cells sequenced) and compared this to the single cells from UCLA1 wild-type cells, which is the genetic background used to make the TFAP2C mutant (Figure 6 A). As shown in UMAP, most of cells from TFAP2C \u2212/\u2212 are aligned with wild-type cells across the six differentiation time points (Figures 6B and 6C). In contrast, the germline cluster marked by NANOS3 is composed almost entirely of wild-type cells (Figure 6C and 6D). The rare TFAP2C \u2212/\u2212 cells in the hPGCLC cluster defined by UMAP were analyzed further and compared to wild-type UCLA1 hPGCLCs. This analysis showed that TFAP2C \u2212/\u2212 hPGCLCs failed to repress genes associated with somatic cell embryonic morphogenesis (Figure S6A), suggesting that TFAP2C functions as predicted in specified hPGCLCs to prevent cells from exiting the germline to adopt a somatic cell fate (Kojima et al., 2017). To evaluate whether TFAP2C functions earlier in the germline trajectory, we applied tcURD analysis to the merged wild-type and TFAP2C \u2212/\u2212 data to identify blades that were highly enriched in wild-type cells (blue) or mutant cells (red) (Figures 6E and 6F). These data show a very distinct blade (red dashed line box in Figure 6F) composed of mostly TFAP2C \u2212/\u2212 cells, that branches from the common day 1 progenitor (blue dashed line box in Figure 6F) to hPGCLCs (labeled as hPGCLC in Figure 6F). This TFAP2C \u2212/\u2212 blade is negative for the hPGCLC markers NANOS3 and SOX17 (Figures 6G and 6H) and instead expresses somatic genes consistent with posterior primitive streak progenitors, including MIXL1, T, HOXB5, HAND1, GATA6, FOXF1, and MESP2. (Figures 6I, 6J, and S6C). To determine the consequence of failing to express TFAP2C in the TFAP2A common progenitors, we identified differentially expressed genes between wild-type and the TFAP2C mutant cells in the progenitor population, and discovered that TFAP2C \u2212/\u2212 cells fail to upregulate SOX17 and downregulate SOX2 (Figure S6D). In contrast, the endoderm trajectory was composed of equivalent percentages of both wild-type and TFAP2C mutant cells, and these cells expressesed SOX17, indicating that the regulation of SOX17 expression by TFAP2C is unique to the germline at this stage in development (Figure 6H). To examine pluripotency and hPGC identity in wild-type and TFAP2C \u2212/\u2212 cells, we evaluated the signatures from cyno Pre-EPI, PostL-EPI, and ecPGCs in day 1 to day 4 cells of the germline trajectory. No difference was detected in day 1 wild-type and TFAP2C \u2212/\u2212 cells; however, starting from day 2, TFAP2C \u2212/\u2212 cells were lower in pre-EPI pluripotency and ePGC identity but higher in PostL-EPI identity (Figure 6K). Collectively, our data indicate that TFAP2C functions to repress somatic cell fate in the newly specified hPGCLCs as first shown by (Kojima et al., 2017). In addition, we uncovered new roles, including preventing the TFAP2A + common progenitor cells from crossing Weismann\u2019s barrier to become somatic cells, uniquely regulating SOX17 expression at the point of hPGCLC specification from the TFAP2A + progenitors, and finally re-wiring pluripotency in the newly specified hPGCLCs at day 2 of aggregate differentiation to a naive-like state similar to primate pre-EPI pluripotency. Discussion Specification of hPGCs in the embryo is critical for the generation of functional gametes in adults. Therefore, understanding the origin and specification of human germline cells is one of the most important events in our fundamental understanding of life, as it defines our ability to have children. The Weissman\u2019s barrier was coined to explain DNA transmission exclusively through germline cells (Weismann 1893). However, in species that differentiate PGCs by induction, the immediate progenitors of the germline differ across the species, and as a result, the TF network required for PGC specification has also diverged. Human embryo attachment culture starting with intact human embryos donated to research suggests that hPGC specification, although rare, begins around day 12 of embryo development prior to the formation of primitive streak and gastrulation. This is consistent with a recent study using OCT4 and SOX17 as hPGC markers (Popovic et al., 2019). Using a different approach, we identified hPGCs/hPGCLCs as being triple positive for N/S/T, and by using the in vitro differentiation of hPGCLCs from hESCs, we showed that when cells co-express N/S/T, they also express the hPGC gene NANOS3. In contrast to the identity of specified hPGCs/hPGCLCs that have well-characterized molecular markers, nothing is known for the peri-implantation progenitor cells in the germline trajectory. In this study, we overcame the challenge by taking advantage of the differentiation time course of hPGCLC specification with scRNA-seq and tcURD-based trajectory analysis to trace the trajectory from hESCs to hPGCLCs. Different from most single-cell genomics trajectory tracing studies, we also managed to compare the trajectories from three genetically different cell lines, namely, high germline competency UCLA2, low germline competency UCLA1, and TFAP2C \u2212/\u2212 UCLA1,which provides us a unique opportunity not only to trace germ cell development and characterize the progenitors before germ cell fate is determined but also to compare trajectories from different cell lines to pinpoint the potential regulatory circuits shared and specific from three scenarios in a stage-specific manner. Our strategy could be applied to other complicated biological trajectories without known markers for each stage Within the germline trajectory after hESCs are induced to differentiate, our data indicate that the immediate pluripotent cell precursors exhibit an identity that can be annotated as simultaneously pre-implantation (naive) and post-implantation (primed) pluripotency. Indeed, transitional pre-implantation embryonic cellular states were recently reported with the re-analysis of the scRNA-seq data from Petropoulos et al. (2016) that identified cells containing both pre-EPI and primitive endoderm identity (Stirparo et al., 2018). Similarly, there is remarkable similarity between ICM and pre-EPI, with only a small number of genes discriminating these different cell types (Blakeley et al., 2015; Petropoulos et al., 2016; Stirparo et al., 2018). Therefore, it could be conceivable that along the germline trajectory previously unannotated transitional states of pluripotency exist, that share pluripotent identities with both naive and primed pluripotent states. Given that this state has not been annotated before, we are calling this transitional naive/primed state of pluripotency \u201cgerminal pluripotency,\u201d which is conducive to hPGC specification, amnion differentiation, and posterior primitive streak/mesoderm/extra embryonic mesenchyme and trophoblast development. This is critical because hPGCLCs are induced from primed state pluripotent stem cells, but our data indicate that these primed cells are reverted to a transitional state of pluripotency to initiate hPGCLC induction. With the exposure to BMP4, progenitors for hPGCLCs are specified from germinal pluripotent cells. The lineage-primed progenitors transiently expressed amnion and gastrulation markers, such as TFAP2A, GATA3, EOMES, and T. In the cyno, the earliest cynoPGCs are identified before primitive streak formation at day 11 in the amnion (Sasaki et al., 2016). Using microfluidics to create posteriorized 3D-modeled embryos, we could identify nascent hPGCLCs in both the amnion as well as the pre-gastrula region 48 h after BMP4 exposure (Zheng et al., 2019). BMP4 was essential to create the posteriorized 3D-modeled embryos with competency to specify hPGCLCs, and similarly, BMP4 is also essential to hPGC specification in the 3D-disorganized aggregates used in the current study (Sasaki et al., 2015). The tcURD analysis of the 3D-disorganized aggregates suggests that in addition to hPGCLCs, BMP4 stimulation creates cells with amnion, gastrulating trophoblast and extra embryonic mesenchyme cell identity in the aggregate. Interestingly, 48 h of BMP4 exposure in the posteriorized 3D embryo models leads to the differentiation of hPGCLCs with the highest similarity to the day 2\u2013day 3 hPGCLCs from the disorganized aggregates. In contrast, the day 4 hPGCLCs from the disorganized aggregates were more closely related to the fully specified ecPGCs from the cyno embryo. Given that this relationship appeared to be time dependent, once the technology for maintaining organized 3D embryo models for longer periods of time is achieved, it will be valuable to determine whether the hPGCLCs from the 3D embryo models progresses closer to fully specified cynoPGC or day 4 hPGCLCs. The advantage of the organized 3D embryo models over the disorganized 3D aggregate is that the site of nascent hPGCLC specification can be evaluated. In the 3D embryo models, hPGCLCs are identified in both the amnion as well as in the pre-gastrula region 48 h after BMP4 exposure. Whether hPGCLCs are first specified in the amnion before migrating into the pre-gastrula regions of the 3D embryo models remains to be determined. In the porcine and mouse peri-implantation embryos, PGCs are identified in the pre-mesendoderm around the time of primitive streak formation (Kobayashi et al., 2017), arguing for a pre-gastrula origin in these species. Without positional information, our germline trajectory using the disorganized aggregates argues for two sites of specification (amnion and gastrula), with hPGCLCs being specified from a flexible TFAP2A-positive embryonic progenitor that has the potential to give rise to multiple somatic fates. Specification of hPGCs requires TFAP2C and SOX17 (Chen et al., 2018; Irie et al., 2015; Kobayashi et al., 2017; Kojima et al., 2017). However, of these two TFs, only SOX17 can induce hPGCLC fate from pre-mesendoderm cells in the absence of growth factor signaling (Kobayashi et al., 2017). SOX17 is also a master regulator of endoderm differentiation. Therefore, the mechanism of action for SOX17 in hPGC specification verses endoderm identity must be controlled by a germline determinant. Our study demonstrates that prior to SOX17 upregulation in the germline trajectory, the immediate progenitors are restrained under Weismann\u2019s barrier and that TFAP2C acts at the point of hPGCLC specification to upregulate SOX17 in the hPGCLCs. Therefore, without TFAP2C to protect the germline integrity, the TFAP2A-positive progenitors \u201ccross\u201d Weismann\u2019s barrier to differentiate into gastrulating cells. In contrast, the formation of amnion is unaffected in the absence of TFAP2C. Thus, our data illustrate that the first role for TFAP2C in the germline is not to induce PGC fate per se but rather to safeguard Weismann\u2019s barrier at the point of hPGC specification and to induce SOX17 in the response to BMP4 from a TFAP2A-positive progenitor and to establish naive-like pluripotency in the germline (Figure 7 ).

Experimental Model and Subject Details Human pre-implantation embryo samples Use of human embryos in this research project followed California State law. This requires review by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the human embryonic stem cell research oversight committee (ESCRO). These committees approve the process of informed consent, and experiments using human embryos for research purposes. Patients were not paid for participation, and all donors were informed that the embryos would be destroyed as part of the research study and that the donated embryos would not be used to make a baby. All research with human embryos in this study complied with the principles laid out in the International Society for Stem Cell Research. Human blastocysts at day (D6), D7 and D8 post fertilization were used in this study (See Table S1). The human blastocysts were thawed using Vit Kit-Thaw (Irvine Scientific) according to manufacturer protocol. After thawing, embryos were cultured overnight in 5%O2, 6% CO2 at 37oC, and the zona pellucida was removed with Tyrode\u2019s acidified solution (Irvine Scientific). Human embryo attachment culture was performed following the procedures of (Deglincerti et al., 2016; Shahbazi et al., 2016) using the commercially available medias IVC1 (In Vitro Culture 1) and IVC2 from Cell Guidance Systems. Human Fetal Gonad samples Use of human fetal tissue in this research project was reviewed by the UCLA IRB and the project was determined as being exempt under 45 CRF 46.102(f). Prenatal gonads were obtained from the University of Washington Birth Defects Research Laboratory (BDRL), under the regulatory oversight of the University of Washington IRB approved Human Subjects protocol combined with a Certificate of Confidentiality from the Federal Government. Human genital ridges were obtained from Professor Katja-Layland, Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology, Stuttgart, Germany, and Department of Women\u2019s Health, Research Institute for Women\u2019s Health, Tubingen, Germany. All consented material was donated anonymously and carried no personal identifiers. Developmental age was documented by BDRL as days post fertilization using a combination of prenatal intakes, foot length, Streeter\u2019s Stages and crown-rump length. All prenatal gonads documented with birth defect or chromosomal abnormality were excluded from this study. The human gonad samples used in this study include week 4 female and week 5 male conceptus, and a day 53 female fetal ovary and a day 59 male fetal testis. Human ESC culture hESCs were cultured on mitomycin C-inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in hESC media, which is composed of 20% knockout serum replacement (KSR) (GIBCO, 10828-028), 100mM L-Glutamine (GIBCO, 25030-081), 1x MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids (NEAA) (GIBCO, 11140-050), 55mM 2-Mercaptoethanol (GIBCO, 21985-023), 10ng/mL recombinant human FGF basic (R&D systems, 233-FB), 1x Penicillin-Streptomycin (GIBCO, 15140-122), and 50ng/mL primocin (InvivoGen, ant-pm-2) in DMEM/F12 media (GIBCO, 11330-032). The hESCs were split every 7 days using Collagenase type IV (GIBCO, 17104-019). All hESC lines used in this study are registered with the National Institute of Health Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry and are available for research use with NIH funds. Mycoplasma test (Lonza, LT07-418) was performed every month. All experiments were approved by the UCLA Embryonic Stem Cell Research Oversight Committee.

Flow cytometry and fluorescence activated cell sorting Aggregates were dissociated with 0.25% trypsin (GIBCO, 25200-056) for 5 min or 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (GIBCO, 25300-054) for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. The dissociated cells were stained with conjugated antibodies, washed with FACS buffer (1% BSA in PBS) and resuspended in FACS buffer with 7-AAD (BD PharMingen, 559925) as viability dye. The single cell suspension was analyzed or sorted for further experiments. The conjugated antibodies used in this study include: ITGA6 conjugated with BV421 (BioLegend, 313624, 1:60), ITGA6 conjugated with 488 (BioLegend, 313608, 1:60), EPCAM conjugated with 488 (BioLegend, 324210, 1:60), EPCAM conjugated with APC (BioLegend, 324208, 1:60). Immunofluorescence Slides of paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized by successive treatment with xylene and 100%, 95%, 70% and 50% ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed by incubation with 10mM Tris pH 9.0, 1mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween at 95C for 40 min. The slides were cooled and washed with 1xPBS (phosphate buffered saline) and 1xTBS (PBS + 0.2% Tween). The samples were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 1xPBS, then washed with 1xTBS and blocked with 10% donkey serum in 1xTBS. Primary antibody incubation was conducted overnight in 10% donkey serum. Samples were again washed with 1xTBS-tween and incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies at 1:200 for 45 min, then washed and mounted using with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (ThermoFisher). For staining of human embryos, attachment cultures were washed once with PBS and fixed in 4% PFA (Electron Microscopy Sciences) at room temperature for 20 min followed by 2 washes in PBS. Attachments were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton-X (Sigma) in PBS for 20 min at room temperature and then washed once in wash buffer 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma) in PBS. Samples were blocked in 10% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in 0.1% Tween-20/PBS at room temperature and incubated with primary antibody diluted in block overnight at 4\u00b0C. Images were taken using LSM 780 Confocal Instrument (Zeiss). The primary antibodies used for immunofluorescence in this study include: rabbit-anti-NANOG (Cell Signaling Technology, 4903, 1:100), mouse-anti-TFAP2C (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc12762, 1:100), goat-anti-SOX17 (Neuromics, GT15094, 1:100). The secondary antibodies used in this study were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories and Invitrogen. Samples were covered in drops of SlowFade Diamond Antifade mountant with DAPI (Invitrogen) and imaged on an LSM780 or LSM880 confocal microscope (Zeiss). All images were processed by Imaris software. Single cell RNA-sequencing Single cell suspension was made from hESCs, iMeLCs, day 1 to day 4 aggregates after trypsin treatment. Single cells were washed three to five times in PBS supplemented with 0.04% BSA. Single cell suspension was sequenced using 10X Genomics. ChIP-sequencing ChIP-seq of hESCs, iMeLCs, and day 4 aggregates with anti-TFAP2C antibodies was performed as previously described (Pastor et al., 2018). Two biological replicates were performed using about 500k cells. hESCs and iMeLCs were dissociated with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (GIBCO, 25300-054) for 5 minutes at 37\u00b0C, and aggregates were dissociated with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (GIBCO, 25300-054) for 10 minutes at 37\u00b0C, followed by washing twice with PBS, fixed in 1% formaldehyde and flash frozen. After thawing, the cells were resuspended in 1 mL of Buffer 1 (10mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 0.25% Triton X-100, 10mM EDTA, 0.5mM EGTA, 1x Protease Inhibitors (Roche), 1mM PMSF) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min on a rotator. Samples were spun at 4000 rpm for 5 min and the pellets were wash with 1 mL of Buffer 2 (10mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 200mM NaCl, 10mM EDTA, 0.5mM EGTA, 1x Protease Inhibitors (Roche), 1mM PMSF) and resuspended in 650 uL Buffer 3 (10mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 10mM EDTA, 0.5mM EGTA, 1x Protease Inhibitors (Roche), 1mM PMSF) and sonicated with Covaris S2 with the following program: Intensity = 5; Cycles/burst = 200; Duty Cycle = 5%; 4 x (30\u201d on/30\u201d off/30\u201d on/30\u201d off). Sonicated lysate was centrifuged at 14,000rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and the supernatant was collected into a new tube. 65 \u03bcL of the supernatant was saved as input. 30 \u03bcL Protein A Dynabeads (Invitrogen, 10001D) was washed with Dilution Buffer (16.7 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2mM EDTA, 167mM NaCl) three times and resuspended in 650 \u03bcL Dilution Buffer and added to the samples. The samples with beads were rotated for 2 hours at 4\u00b0C and the beads were removed by magnetic rack. Each sample was split into two parts: one half for Rabbit-anti-TFAP2C (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-8977), and the other half for Rabbit-IgG as control. Samples were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. On the second day, 60uL of pre-washed Protein A Dynabeads was added to each sample and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 2 hours. Samples were placed on magnetic rack to remove supernatant and the beads were washed twice with Buffer A (50mM HEPES pH7.9, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Deoxycholate, 1mM EDTA, 140mM NaCl), Buffer B (50mM HEPES pH7.9, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Deoxycholate, 1mM EDTA, 500mM NaCl), TE and eluted with 150 \u03bcL of Elution Buffer (50mM Tris-Cl pH8, 1mM EDTA, 1% SDS) and incubated at 65\u00b0C for 10 min. Samples were placed on magnetic rack and ChIP-samples were collected. Both ChIP-samples and input samples were heated overnight at 65\u00b0C. On the third day, samples were treated with 1.5uL of 10mg/mL RNaseA (PureLink RNase A, Invitrogen 12091-021) for 30 min at 65\u00b0C and then with 10ul of 10mg/mL Proteinase K for 2 hours at 56\u00b0C. Samples were purified with MinElute PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, 28006). ChIP-seq libraries were made using Ovation Ultralow Systems V2 (NuGEN, 0344) according the instruction. For ChIP-seq of sorted day4 hPGCLCs using anti-H3K27ac antibodies, about 5000 sorted hPGCLCs were collected and ChIP was performed using Low Cell ChIP-Seq Kit (ACTIVE MOTIF, 53084). Quantification and Statistical Analysis Experimental design Single cell RNA-seq libraries were made from tow biological replicates of UCLA1, UCLA2 and TFAP2C mutant hESCs, iMeLCs, and day 1 to day 4 aggregates. ChIP-seq libraries were made from two biological replicates of UCLA1 hESCs, iMeLCs, day4 aggregates with anti-TFAP2C antibodies and sorted hPGCLCs with anti-H3K27ac antibodies. No statistical calculation was used to estimate the sample size. Randomization/stratification/blinding were not applicable to these experiments. For flow cytometry, at least ten biological replicates were performed. For statistical analysis, mean and standard error of the mean and t test were calculated using Graphpad Prism software Replicates and data pooling To call ChIP-seq peaks or display ChIP-seq data in Figure 5, all reads from same condition were merged to increase coverage. For single cell RNA-seq, two biological replicates were merged after batch correction. Single-cell RNA-seq data analysis The reads from single cell RNA-seq were aligned to the GRCh38 human reference genome using the Cell Range v.2.2.0 pipeline with default parameters (10x Genomes). The generated cell-by-gene unique molecular identifier (UMI) count matrix was analyzed using the Seurat R package v.2.3.4. We only kept the cells expressing at least 200 genes and genes with expression in at least 3 cells. The cells were also filtered by the maximum of 8000 expressed genes and of 20% mitochondrial genes. The UMI counts were then normalized for each cell by the total expression, multiplied by 10000, and log-transformed. We used Seurat\u2019s default method to identify highly variable genes and scale data for regressing out variation from UMI and mitochondrial genes. The scaled data with variable genes was used to perform principal component analysis (PCA). The top 50 principal components were chosen for further analysis, including clustering to identify cell populations. UMAPs were calculated by RunUMAP function in Seurat package using top 50 PCs and min_dist = 0.75. To do batch correction between two biological replicates, we used Seurat\u2019s canonical correlation analysis procedure with default parameter. Briefly, this analysis identifies vectors with correlation between datasets and then aligns values along these vectors to reduce the variation from batch. The top 30 canonical correlation vectors were used further for clustering and UMAP visualization. Prediction of developmental trajectories using tcURD The matrix of cell X top 30 CCA components after batch correction was used to build the tree of lineages by tcURD, which is based on URD package (v.1.0.2) in R (Farrell et al., 2018) and do pseudotime analysis afterward. We modified URD as tcURD where the diffusion map is calculated by destiny package from a sparse distance matrix, with 0 for most of element except those from nearest neighbors. Instead of calculating distance from top K nearest neighbors for each cell among all other cells, we put a time constraint that nearest neighbors could only come from samples at the same or nearby time point for this time series experiment so that we could avoid artificial connections of two cells from samples far away from each other in temporal order. The pipeline can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/kdyhl/singleCell_tcURD). Annotation of cell lineage We re-processed the single cell RNA-seq data in 390 single cells of cynomolgus embryos across 13 cell types (GEO: GSE74767). Specifically, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across 13 cell types and generated the average expression profiles for 13 cell types based on these DEGs. The average profiles for cells at the stage of hPGCLC day4 were also generated in the same way across the segments in the URD tree. We next calculated the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) to evaluate the similarity between each lineage in the URD tree and cell type in cyno embryo. The similar analysis was carried out to define the cell identity of clusters in ex vivo single cell data. Signature analysis We downloaded the processed single cell RNA-seq data of cynomolgus (cyno) embryos ( GEO: GSE74767, GSE76267) and identified the highly expressed genes as signature for each cell type annotated in the original paper compared with cells from all different cell identities. Next, we calculated the average expression level of each signature set in single cells of germline trajectory and visualized by heatmap. We also downloaded the processed single cell RNA-seq data from naive and primed hESCs (GEO: GSE76970) and did the similar analysis. Similar analysis was performed in single cell RNA-seq data of human synthetic amnion-like cells (hsAM) and PGCLCs (hsPGCLC) derived by exposing the H9 hESC line to BMP4 for 48 hours using the synthetic embryonic-like sac model. Identification of germline trajectory differentially expressed genes (gtDEGs) We defined germline trajectory differentially expressed genes (gtDEGs) as below: (1) we identified the pseudotime correlation genes with absolute Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) > 0.2 between pseudotime and gene expression level. (2) we called the differentially expression genes between any two time points across germline trajectory using FindAllMarkers function in Seurat package with default parameters. (3) the union of geneset (1) or (2) were defined as gtDEGs for further analysis. Motif analysis To predict the upstream regulators of gtDEGs, we identified the enrichment of transcription factor binding motifs in the promoter region (500bp upstream to 100bp downstream of transcription start site) using findMotifs.pl function in HOMER v4.9 software with default parameters. Those transcription factors were then filtered by gtDEGs. Transcription factor (TF) network analysis Among gtDEGs, we focused on the regulatory relationship between transcription factors. We build a TF-TF regulatory network based on the presence of transcription factor binding motif at promoter regions (500bp upstream to 100bp downstream of transcription start site). The network was visualized in Cytoscape v.3.7.1(Shannon et al., 2003). We annotated nodes and edges. The color of node represents the pseudotime of its highest expression levels from red to yellow. The size of node represents the degree (number of edges). The shape of node represents whether it belongs to upstream regulator (triangle: regulator; circle: non-regulator). The arrow of edge represents the direction of regulation. ChIP-seq analysis FastQC were used to check the quality of the sequencing reads. Then reads were mapped to the reference hg19 genome using bowtie by allowing maximal two mismatches per reads and take one best hit when the reads can be mapped to multiple places. PCR duplciates were removed using SAMtools and ChIPseq tracks were generated with deeptools.

The foundation of this model is the quality of the first progenitors called primordial germ cells (PGCs), which in vivo are specified during the peri-implantation window of human development. Here, we show that human PGC (hPGC) specification begins at day 12 post-fertilization. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of hPGC-like cells (hPGCLCs) differentiated from pluripotent stem cells, we discovered that hPGCLC specification involves resetting pluripotency toward a transitional state with shared characteristics between naive and primed pluripotency, followed by differentiation into lineage-primed TFAP2A+ progenitors. Applying the germline trajectory to TFAP2C mutants reveals that TFAP2C functions in the TFAP2A+ progenitors upstream of PRDM1 to regulate the expression of SOX17. This serves to protect hPGCLCs from crossing the Weismann\u2019s barrier to adopt somatic cell fates and, therefore, is an essential mechanism for successfully initiating in vitro gametogenesis.",
