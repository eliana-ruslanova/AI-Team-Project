In this article, both the efforts to create a united Europe and the achievements in dealing with esophageal atresia from the 1950s on are outlined. Furthermore, this paper deals with the future of pediatric surgery and is focused on two aspects: the \u201cFourth Industrial Revolution\u201d which builds on the digital revolution, artificial intelligence and robotics, and its potential impact on pediatric surgery and the life of patients. I suggest that pediatric surgeons should participate and lead in the development of machine learning, data control, assuring appropriate use of machines, control misuse, and in particular ensure appropriate maintenance of ethical standards. Changes in health care structures within Europe, in particular the effect of centralization, will affect the concept of treatment for patients with rare diseases.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Esophageal atresia"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "History of surgery"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022346818307310", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022346818307310", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85057988849", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85057988849", "pubmed-id": "30545729", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85057988849", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20181107", "$": "2018-11-07"}}}}}
