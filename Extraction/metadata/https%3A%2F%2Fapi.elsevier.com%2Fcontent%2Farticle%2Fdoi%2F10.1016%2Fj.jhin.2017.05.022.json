A microbiology-based assessment of the procedure was conducted. Twenty-five artificial hand models underwent initial full contamination, then disinfection with UV-dyed hand-rub solution, digital imaging under UV-light, microbiological sampling and cultivation, and digital imaging of the cultivated flora were performed. Paired images of each hand model were registered by a software tool, then the UV-marked regions were compared with the pathogen-free sites pixel by pixel. Statistical evaluation revealed that the method indicates correctly disinfected areas with 95.05% sensitivity and 98.01% specificity.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "UV-dyed hand rub"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Validation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hand hygiene assessment"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Infection prevention"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Infection control"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670117302943", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670117302943", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85021746685", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85021746685", "pubmed-id": "28579470", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85021746685", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20170601", "$": "2017-06-01"}}}}}
