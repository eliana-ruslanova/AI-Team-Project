One of the most relevant research topics that can benefit from these techniques is phylogenetic inference. Throughout the years, different researchers have proposed their own view about the reconstruction of ancestral evolutionary relationships among species. As a result, biologists often report different phylogenetic trees from a same dataset when considering distinct optimality principles. In this work, we detail a multiobjective swarm intelligence approach based on the novel Artificial Bee Colony algorithm for inferring phylogenies. The aim of this paper is to propose a complementary view of phylogenetics according to the maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood criteria, in order to generate a set of phylogenetic trees that represent a compromise between these principles. Experimental results on a variety of nucleotide data sets and statistical studies highlight the relevance of the proposal with regard to other multiobjective algorithms and state-of-the-art biological methods.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Bioinspired computation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Computational biology"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Swarm intelligence"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Multiobjective optimization"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Phylogeny reconstruction"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0303264713001615", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303264713001615", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84882673571", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84882673571", "pubmed-id": "23850533", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84882673571", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20130712", "$": "2013-07-12"}}}}}
