Abstract Background Student participation and the use of active methodologies in classroom learning are being increasingly emphasized. The use of intelligent systems can be of great help when designing and developing these types of activities. Recently, emerging disciplines such as \u2018educational data mining\u2019 and \u2018learning analytics and knowledge\u2019 have provided clear examples of the importance of the use of artificial intelligence techniques in education. Objective The main objective of this study was to gather expert opinions regarding the benefits of using complementary methods that are supported by intelligent systems, specifically, by intelligent information access systems, when processing texts written in natural language and the benefits of using these methods as companion tools to the learning activities that are employed by biomedical and health sciences teachers. Methods Eleven teachers of degree courses who belonged to the Faculties of Biomedical Sciences (BS) and Health Sciences (HS) of a Spanish university in Madrid were individually interviewed. These interviews were conducted using a mixed methods questionnaire that included 66 predefined close-ended and open-ended questions. In our study, three intelligent information access systems (i.e., BioAnnote, CLEiM and MedCMap) were successfully used to evaluate the teacher\u2019s perceptions regarding the utility of these systems and their different methods in learning activities. Results All teachers reported using active learning methods in the classroom, most of which were computer programs that were used for initially designing and later executing learning activities. All teachers used case-based learning methods in the classroom, with a specific emphasis on case reports written in Spanish and/or English. In general, few or none of the teachers were familiar with the technical terms related to the technologies used for these activities such as \u201cintelligent systems\u201d or \u201cconcept/mental maps\u201d. However, they clearly realized the potential applicability of such approaches in both the preparation and the effective use of these activities in the classroom. Specifically, the themes highlighted by a greater number of teachers after analyzing the responses to the open-ended questions were the usefulness of BioAnnote system to provide reliable sources of medical information and the usefulness of the bilingual nature of CLEiM system for learning medical terminology in English. Conclusions Three intelligent information access systems were successfully used to evaluate the teacher\u2019s perceptions regarding the utility of these systems in learning activities. The results of this study showed that integration of reliable sources of information, bilingualism and selective annotation of concepts were the most valued features by the teachers, who also considered the incorporation of these systems into learning activities to be potentially very useful. In addition, in the context of our experimental conditions, our work provides useful insights into the way to appropriately integrate this type of intelligent information access systems into learning activities, revealing key themes to consider when developing such approaches. Keywords Intelligent information access (IIA) systems Teaching/learning strategies Mixed methods Case-based learning (CBL) Concept-based learning Bilingualism 1 Introduction Traditional models of learning, which involved the use of tests to assess the acquisition of knowledge regarding large blocks of information, have evolved toward methods in which both learning and its assessment are progressive. These models are part of a new paradigm of student-centered learning that was heavily emphasized in the trend report produced for the 2010 Bologna Anniversary Conference [1]. This report stressed the importance of designing activities that allow students to acquire knowledge via participation (active learning) rather than solely learning information through teacher-driven activities [2,3]. This novel and reoriented education model has been accompanied by the development of different collaborative learning methods involving the resolution of real and simulated cases. These learning methods might be applied via project work, problem-solving, case studies, or concepts or mental maps [4\u201313]; additionally, these methods can make use of information systems and even certain key features of traditional learning approaches [14\u201316]. In this context, the development of information technologies has led to the creation of new educational methods and learning activities such as e-learning, online learning, Internet-based learning or web-based learning, all of which marry well with student-centered learning [17\u201321]. The use of intelligent systems in general, as well as, intelligent information access (IIA) systems in particular (e.g., recommendation systems, search engines, keyword annotators, learning algorithms, etc.), is an emerging strategy that is being applied by certain virtual learning environments (VLE) and as a component of learning activities [22\u201325]. A good example of the extent to which intelligent systems are being incorporated into VLEs is the emergence of new scientific disciplines that study the application of text and data mining techniques within the field of education, such as educational data mining (EDM) and learning analytics and knowledge (LAK) [26\u201328]. The application of IIA systems in the biomedical domains is becoming a reality. In this context, the ability to automatically search for concepts in natural language medical texts has been under continuous development for approximately 20 years. MedLEE [29] was one of the first systems designed to extract clinical information from unstructured text, linking it to terms belonging to a controlled vocabulary entitled SNOMED CT [30]. Appearing in 1994, it was used to process radiological reports [31]. Another major system, MetaMap [32], which was developed by the National Library of Medicine (NLM), is focused on the identification of concepts that best represent text introduced by a user [33]. An excellent review of these information systems and their applications is available in the article authored by Meystre et al. [34]. Given the practical nature of the health professions, active learning methods have been rapidly adopted in medical education. This fact has been accompanied by increased development of intelligent systems that utilize these methods, e.g., tools that incorporate semantic information via annotation [35,36], and annotation and recovery systems based on the use of ontologies [37\u201339]. The ability of these types of systems to enable the integration of knowledge sources and, thus, allow end-users to recover descriptive information on the elements extracted or to delve further into these data using concepts related to the elements that are recognized is without precedence. In addition, although some IIA systems have been successfully tested in educational settings, there is a lack of knowledge of: (i) teachers\u2019 perceptions of these systems and their use in learning activities; and (ii) teachers\u2019 knowledge regarding the text mining techniques applied to process user input. Taking into consideration the aforementioned findings, in our current work, we designed and carried out individual semi-structured interviews with BS and HS faculty members to gather expert opinions regarding the benefits of using different methods and IIA systems to process natural language texts and the utility of these methods as tools in the application of learning activities. Specifically, questions were designed to collect information around the following main blocks: (1) general information and knowledge of active teaching methods; (2) knowledge related to concept annotation; (3) knowledge related to cross-lingual concept extraction; (4) knowledge related to concept/mental maps; and (5) classification of the examined IIA systems. 2 Methods 2.1 Study design Mixed methods [40] are commonly used to assess satisfaction with and perceptions of the use of information systems in education in general [41\u201343] and biomedical education in particular [44]. In this line of thought, surveys of user perceptions have received special attention in the scientific community [45\u201347]. The present study adopted a mixed methodology, making use of a questionnaire that included a set of close-ended questions that allowed for the quantitative analysis of data and a set of open-ended questions that enabled the collection of qualitative data regarding the teachers\u2019 opinions via semi-structured interviews, an approach that permitted the interviewer to clarify previous answers and complement the questionnaire with extra data. In addition to the collection of data regarding the interviewee\u2019s personal information and background, the questionnaire focused on the main topics of study, such as information tools and sources of information; case-based learning (CBL) methods and the use of case reports; intelligent systems and natural language processing (NPL); knowledge related to concept annotation; knowledge related to cross-lingual concept extraction; and knowledge related to conceptual or mental maps. To this end, BioAnnote [48,49], CLEiM [50] and MedCMap [51] were chosen to evaluate the teacher\u2019s perceptions of the use of IIA systems based on concept annotation, cross-lingual concept extraction, and conceptual or mental maps in learning activities. 2.2 Questionnaire design A questionnaire was designed that included questions clustered into eleven categories directly related to the main topics of study. Table 1 show how these categories were grouped into five complementary blocks: (1) general information and knowledge of active teaching methods; (2) knowledge related to concept annotation; (3) knowledge related to cross-lingual concept extraction; (4) knowledge related to concept/mental maps and (5) arrangement of the evaluated IIA systems in decreasing order by perceived usefulness. The questionnaire, which included a total of 66 questions, is shown in Table 2 . As previously mentioned, the interviews included both quantitative and qualitative questions. Examples of quantitative questions (i.e., close-ended questions) included the following: (i) questions regarding \u201cAge\u201d and \u201cYears of teaching experience\u201d; (ii) fixed response questions, such as \u201cSex (male/female)\u201d or \u201cWhat do you believe your level of English proficiency to be? (high/medium/low)\u201d; and (iii) Likert-type scale questions with responses ranging from 1 to 5, where 1 indicated \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d and 5 indicated \u201cstrongly agree\u201d (e.g., \u201cDo you think the BioAnnote system is useful for preparing CBL activities?\u201d). Qualitative questions (i.e., open-ended questions) allowed for the discussion to be extended beyond the script, providing deeper levels of information. Examples of this type of question include the following: \u201cWhat computer programs do you use to prepare activities?\u201d and \u201cWhat programs do you use to carry out these activities in the classroom?\u201d. A more detailed description of the questions included within each category is provided in Appendix A. 2.3 IIA systems for learning activities To gain an understanding of the perceptions of the teachers regarding the application of IIA systems based on concept annotation, cross-lingual concept extraction and conceptual or mental maps in learning activities, the BioAnnote, CLEiM and MedCMap systems were respectively used. These three systems use text mining techniques to automatically extract medical concepts from inputted case reports. In addition, all of these systems allow users to obtain additional information regarding the concepts extracted and semantically related concepts. The three systems collect all output information under a single interface. However, from an end-user point of view, the functions offered by these systems differ significantly from one another. Table 3 shows the main characteristics of each analyzed system. The following is a detailed description of the characteristics and functionalities of each of the three systems. 2.3.1 BioAnnote system BioAnnote [48,49] is a IIA system for the automatic annotation of biomedical resources. BioAnnote integrates a component previously developed with the AIBench Framework software [8,52]. A representative image of this system is shown in Fig. 1 . The BioAnnote system includes: (i) a desktop application that allow users to annotate biomedical texts by using different high-quality online, such as Medlineplus and Freebase; (ii) an extensible and embeddable annotation meta-server to annotate documents using local or remote ontologies; and (iii) a client/server protocol to enable the use this meta-server by third-party applications. By using the BioAnnote system, users can submit biomedical documents and obtain annotations for the relevant terms (e.g. diseases, symptoms and treatments) from the BioAnnote server ontologies (Medlineplus and Freebase) or online NCBO ontologies. BioAnnote also allows users to retrieve detailed information for each annotated entity, including related topics, external links, related bibliography and paper abstracts. In addition, this system includes a powerful scripting engine able to perform batch annotations. Bioannote is available, as opensource software, for the main 2.3.2 CLEiM system CLEiM (Cross Lingual Education in Medicine) [50], is a later version of the BioAnnote system. A representative image of this system is shown in Fig. 2 . CLEiM maintains the same interface but includes new terms in the preprocessing stage and a cross-lingual information access system. Specifically, it is a java client-server web application which focus on named entity recognition (NER) in English and Spanish. CLEiM allows users to input a text containing medical terms (e.g. diseases, treatments, symptoms, etc.) and easily to deepen the meaning of these terms using the web navigator. The system uses preprocessed dictionaries from qualified sources as MedlinePlus and SnomedCT terminologies, and a working flow built with the NLP architecture GATE and integrated through the Java API provided by GATE. This preprocess stage is an offline task that does not slow down the online process followed by the user. Besides, the system uses information of several linked data to show more details and relations among the terms. The installation of the system requires a Java web server and it is available as opensource software. 2.3.3 MedCMap system MedCMap system [51] integrates elements of BioAnnote with elements of the BuscaMed [53] software. BuscaMed is a web system for the visually assisted search of relevant biomedical information through a concept graph. The MedCMap system: (i) builds a concept graph through an initial concept referring a disease, discovering causes, symptoms and treatments; (ii) helps the user to define their information needs, how to express better the search string through the visual aid of the concept graph. The user receives complementary information of the selected concept, as translations, images, links, definitions and synonyms; (iii) makes a search on a list of pre-selected biomedical repositories. A representative image of this system is shown in Fig. 3 . The MedCMap system is based on UMLS Metathesaurus (accessed through a REST API service) and on Wikidata (accessed through the MediaWiki API). The visual representation of retrieved information is made with Javascript library D3 displaying a force-directed graph. MedCMap system is available in English language. 2.4 Sample To conduct our study, we selected 11 teachers with different training and experience backgrounds who taught BS and HS degree courses at the Universidad Europea de Madrid (UEM), Spain. The UEM Faculty of BS teaches medicine, dentistry, pharmacy and biotechnology, while the Faculty of HS teaches physiotherapy, chiropody, nursing and optometry. The sample was selected in an intentional and purposeful way, and teachers with complementary professional profiles and different areas of specialization and teaching experience were selected. The selection process was performed in accordance with previous studies in related thematic areas, both in the size and profile of the sample [46,54,55]. All members of these two faculties were asked to participate in the study, and a total of 11 teachers provided written consent to be interviewed and recorded. The respondents were assigned a numeric identification code to maintain their anonymity. 2.5 Data collection The interviews were carried out by four university teachers, two from the Faculty of BS and two from the Faculty of Computer Science (CS). To ensure interview consistency, the first interview was performed with all four interviewers present, while the remaining interviews were carried out with one interviewer from each faculty. All interviews were recorded using professional audio equipment and digitally recorded using a computer equipped with appropriate software [56]. Their average duration was 45\u202fmin 5\u202fs (ranging from 29\u202fmin 19\u202fs to 1\u202fh 1\u202fmin 3\u202fs). Output transcripts were generated by one of the interviewers, who summarized the results in a table. A first version of this table was initially shared with the remaining members of the interviewer team, who checking the cells for errors or incomplete data in an iterative manner. Further analysis of the results also followed an iterative process. 2.6 Data analysis The analysis of the data consisted of a quantitative analysis, or evaluation of the responses to quantitative questions, and a qualitative analysis, or thematic evaluation of the responses to qualitative questions. The first analysis was performed on each quantitative question belonging to each category in each block. The results from this analysis are presented in this format in the next section. For this task, we selected the mode and median as quantitative measures of the responses to Likert-type scale questions. In addition, we compared the respondents\u2019 perceptions of the BioAnnote, CLEiM and MedCMap systems. The qualitative analysis involved extracting key themes (such us reliability of information sources, bilingualism and their usefulness as a study method) from the responses to the open-ended questions. The set of transcribed fragments are available in Appendix B, Appendix C and Appendix D, wherein each fragment is preceded by the corresponding respondent\u2019s identification code. Appendix B contains selected fragments concerning the use of annotation systems and the respondent\u2019s opinion of the BioAnnote system. Appendix C contains selected fragments from the same respondents regarding their use of the concept extraction systems and opinion of the CLEiM system. Finally, Appendix D contains selected fragments from general comments made regarding the construction of concept/mental maps and particular observations concerning MedCMap application. 3 Results & discussion In this section, we present and discuss the results obtained following the structure described above, in which the responses to the 66 questions classified into 11 categories were finally analyzed. We summarize the information in 5 blocks focused on: (i) general information and knowledge of active learning methods (Section 3.1); (ii) knowledge related to concept annotation (Section 3.2); (iii) knowledge related to cross-lingual concept extraction (Section 3.3); (iv) knowledge related to conceptual or mental maps (Section 3.4); and (v) classification of the intelligent systems (Section 3.5). Additionally, Section 3.6 presents and discusses some key themes extracted from the open-ended questions. 3.1 Block 1: general information and knowledge of active learning methods 3.1.1 Category 1: personal information and background In accordance with our methodological approach, we considered a sample of teachers with diverse profiles, including their background, subject area, teaching experience, age and sex. Of the 11 BS and HS teachers interviewed, 9 were women and 2 were men. The mean age of these teachers was 42.55 years. All taught degree classes at Faculty of BS, Faculty of HS or both. More detail of the responses to questions regarding to personal information and background are reported in Table 4 . Regarding the perceived English level by type of degree, the teachers\u2019 perceptions of the level of English proficiency among their students were high intermediate for medical students, and low intermediate for other types of student. These data are important for the development of cross-lingual systems as classroom learning aids and less important with respect to helping teachers prepare activities. Finally, be highlighting that none of the instructors considered himself/herself to possess an expert level of computer knowledge. 3.1.2 Category 2: information tools and sources of information used in the preparation or execution of active learning activities A synthesis of the teachers\u2019 responses to the questions of this category, which are presented below, are reported in Table 5 . All the teachers reported they used computers in some way in the classroom, mainly for projecting content during classes (for presentations, showing videos, use of the digital Blackboard and Internet searches). Although all reported using active learning methods (of very different types), only 1 used more sophisticated software (for statistical analysis) in the preparation and execution of activities. These results highlight the need to produce more user-friendly software for teachers and the need for training regarding the software\u2019s use. Two respondents reported using no specialized computer program (excluding Internet browsers) to prepare activities, of whom 1 had never used such software in the classroom (the other had only used the Google search tool). Most of the 9 interviewees who indicated that they did use computer programs for preparing learning activities also used these programs in the classroom (only three did not). All respondents cited the use of bibliographic resources for the preparation of activities. Fourteen Internet information sources were reported as being used during teaching activities. The most commonly used was PubMed/Medline (used by 64%); the use of other information sources, such as Ocenet or Elsevier, was far less prevalent (18%). Finally, the Dialnet, University of Delaware Faculty of Medicine, UEM digital library, Fisterra, CDC, OMS, Vademecum, Spanish or European Medicines Agency, Scopus, Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de Microbiolog\u00eda and Francisco Soria Melguizo websites were mentioned by 1 teacher. 3.1.3 Category 3: CBL methods and use of case reports All respondents knew what CBL was, and all but one used CBL in the classroom; of the remaining 10, 2 said they used it only occasionally. This type of activity, therefore, appeared to be used by many teachers of biomedical subjects. All of those who used CBL methods used case reports during the execution of these activities. These reports originated from several sources: written by the respondents themselves (6 out of 11), real-life case reports that they modified to meet the needs of the course (3 out of 11) and case reports from books, journals or the Internet (4 out of 11). The most used language for the case reports was Spanish (6 out of 11), although some respondents also used English (2 out of 11) and both languages (4 out of 11). The descriptions of how these case reports were used in learning activities demonstrated the same general principles with slight procedural differences. One respondent used several case reports instead of a single report. All teachers made the reports available to their students so that they could prepare before class (via Internet o Moodle mainly). Only 4 mentioned including the use of case reports for student evaluation purposes. Six respondents said they discussed the case with the class following the activity. Thus, the lack of any standardization in terms of implementing such activities was noticeable. 3.1.4 Category 4: intelligent systems and NLP systems in the classroom No respondent knew the meaning of the term \u201cintelligent system\u201d. However, after being provided an explanation by one of the interviewers, 2 confirmed they used an intelligent system to prepare learning activities, and 3 (the latter 2 plus 1 more) said they used an intelligent system in the classroom with students. These systems included searching, with a concept in mind, for videos on YouTube, searching clinical practice guides, and student-performed Google searches. Two respondents had a basic idea of what an NLP system was. However, after being provided an explanation by one of the interviewers about what a NLP system was, 4 respondents reported using NLP system (google translate and google search). 3.2 Block 2: knowledge related to concept annotation 3.2.1 Category 5: use of annotators None of the respondents knew what an \u201cintelligent system for concept annotation\u201d was, and the instructors confirmed they were unaware of such systems even after one of the interviewers explained their characteristics. Naturally, therefore, none of the respondents had used one of these systems to either to prepare or execute learning activities. Most (10 out of 11) or all the respondents believed such a system would be useful when preparing and executing CBL activities respectively. However, two respondents thought this might prove difficult: one of these persons only observed such systems being of use to brighter students, and the other thought it made searching for information too easy for students (this teacher believed that searching for information to be an important part of learning in his/her course). 3.2.2 Category 6: opinions regarding the use of the BioAnnote annotation system in learning activities After showing the respondents the BioAnnote system, the answers to the Likert-type scale questions showed that most believed that the system was useful during both the preparation (Q1 response) and execution (Q2 response) of learning activities. Both the mode and median values for the measure of the usefulness of the BioAnnote system in the preparation and execution of activities were 4 and 5, respectively, i.e., \u201cAgree\u201d and \u201cStrongly Agree\u201d. The respondents\u2019 perceptions of the BioAnnote system are reported in Table 6 . Some additional comments regarding this system were made by some respondents following explanation of the system by the interviewer and after answering Q1 and Q2 (Table 6; see the fragments recorded for respondents 1\u20135 and 8 in Appendix B). Other respondents made comments during the explanation provided by the interviewer (see square brackets in the Appendices) regarding the characteristics of the system and the sources of information from which it derives information (see the fragments recorded for respondents 6\u20139 and 10\u201311 in Appendix B). 3.3 Block 3: knowledge related to cross-lingual concept extraction 3.3.1 Category 7:Use of monolingual and cross-lingual concept extraction systems Beyond a certain intuition as to what a concept extraction system might be, none of the respondents was certain what the term \u201cconcept extraction system\u201d meant. They had also never used such a system. Similarly, none of the respondent was familiar with cross-lingual systems. Following the explanation provided by the interviewer, all interviewees believed that such systems might be of use when preparing and executing learning activities. 3.3.2 Category 8: opinions regarding the use of the CLEiM cross-lingual concept extraction system in learning activities The respondents\u2019 perceptions of the CLEiM system are reported in Table 6. The answers provided in response to the Likert-type scale questions suggested that the majority of participants agreed or strongly agreed with the usefulness of the system. The respondents\u2019 comments regarding this type of system and the comments that respondent made after being shown the CLEiM system are in Appendix C. 3.4 Block 4: knowledge related to concept/mental maps 3.4.1 Category 9: use of concept/mental maps Five respondents were familiar with concept/mental maps. Only 1 respondent knew of a tool that might help when executing activities based on concept/mental maps, specifically FreeMind [57], and had used it both for preparing and executing learning activities. Curiously, this respondent did not know what concept/mental maps were, and at first indicated that he/she did not know how they would be used. However, after being explained their nature, the respondent indicated that he/she had used something similar during tutorials (for explanatory rather than assessment purposes). All and the most of respondents (10 out of 11) indicated that such a tool would be useful to help them use mental maps in the classroom and for preparing such activities, respectively. 3.4.2 Category 10: opinions regarding the use of the MedCMap mental map system in learning activities The respondents\u2019 perceptions of the MedCMap system are reported in Table 6. The answers provided in response to the Likert-type scale questions suggested that respondents mostly strongly agreed with the usefulness of the system. Appendix D contains fragments from the transcriptions regarding the respondent\u2019s opinions of the use of concept/mental maps and the MedCMap system. 3.5 Block 5: arrangement of the examined IIA systems 3.5.1 Category 11: how would you order the systems evaluated herein in terms of their usefulness in teaching? (decreasing order by perceived usefulness) A graphical representation of the classification of the three systems in terms of their perceived usefulness in teaching is shown in Fig. 4 . The respondents\u2019 answers to this question showed that the most highly regarded system was CLEiM, while the least regarded system was BioAnnote. From those results, we established a relationship between the responses to Q1 and Q2 questions (Table 6). Thus, despite the fact that higher mode and median scores were returned for the MedCMap system on both Q1 and Q2, more responses were clustered around the 4 and 5 mark for the BioAnnote and CLEiM systems. Both the median and mode values of the respondents\u2019 answers to the Q2 questions indicated that the respondents strongly agreed with the usefulness of all three assessed systems in the execution of activities. Thus, the relatively small number of respondents who preferred the MedCMap system valued it very highly, while the other systems were perceived as more useful than MedCMap. Specifically, the cross-lingual features of the CLEiM system made it be selected by most of the respondents as the most useful of the three IIA systems evaluated. 3.6 Key themes extracted from the open-ended questions (1) Our analysis of the fragments recorded in response to the open-ended questions (Appendices B, C and D) revealed a set of key themes (Table 7 ) regarding the potential use of BioAnnote, CLEiM and MedCMap systems by the teachers. These key themes are listed in detail below: (2) The most highlighted themes were (highlighted by 5 out of 11 respondent) the usefulness of BioAnnote system to provide reliable sources of medical information (rigorous medical terminology and quality bibliographic information) and the usefulness of the bilingual nature of CLEiM system for learning medical terminology in English. (3) The following theme highlighted by the respondents (4 out of 11) was the selective annotation feature of BioAnnote system, which allowed teachers to select the terms that the system annotated. (4) Three out of eleven respondents also highlighted themes respect to the MedCMap system, which were: (i) usefulness as study method and for summarizing content; (ii) usefulness as formal assessment method of subject knowledge at the end of a course; (iii) the map format feature of MedCMap system, as well as their different presentation options, were highlighted as a means of condensing information and for assessment, too and; (iv) difficulty of use, both for the difficulty of understanding conceptual maps and for the time required to learn to use the system. (5) In addition to the previous key themes, 7 other themes were highlighted by a low number of the teachers (1 or 2 out of 11). However, as part of the qualitative study, it is interesting to take them into account. Therefore, these themes as well as their interpretation are also shown in Table 7. 4 Limitations The outcomes of this work are circumscribed to the perceptions reported by a relatively small number of participants. Interviewing teachers with different backgrounds provided interesting and diverse data within the study but also may have contributed to an increase in the variability of their perceptions. Future studies should be conducted including a greater number of participants and other IIA systems in order to achieve greater generality of results. The applications employed for assessing the general conceptualization and utility of IIA systems in the preparation and execution of learning activities were also associated with some limitations, such as the use of data limited sources and technical constraints. However, such applications encompassed the options offered on the web. 5 Implications Despite the limitations mentioned in the previous section, this work showed that IIA systems that may aid in the processing of natural language texts could be very useful for improving current active learning platforms used for active learning activities, such as Moodle [58\u201360] or Blackboard [61,62]. In addition, they also provided a reliable source of information without requiring the separate use of Internet search resources. 6 Conclusions In summary, this work describes the results of an analysis of the knowledge and perceptions of degree teachers about active learning methods and intelligent systems in general, as well as, the utility of three IIA systems, as effective tools in preparing and executing learning activities. Our results showed that few or none of the interviewees were familiar with technical terms related to the systems such as \u201cintelligent systems\u201d or \u201cconcept/mental maps\u201d. However, they understood the potential utility of the BioAnnote, CLEiM and MedCMap systems, both in the preparation of activities and in their implementation in the classroom. In other words, this work showed that integration of reliable sources of information, bilingualism and selective annotation of concepts were the features most valued by the teachers, who also considered the incorporation of these IIA systems into learning activities to be potentially very useful. Additionally, and taking into account our experimental conditions, this work highlights the utility to integrate IIA systems into active learning, and the results of this work also suggest some key themes to consider when developing these types of systems.

Summary points What was already known on the topic? - Data suggest that different types of intelligent information access (IIA) systems can be successfully applied in the educational system. - However, there are few examples of the application of systems utilizing artificial intelligence techniques to solve practical problems in the active learning paradigm in higher education. - IIA systems have already been shown to be useful in active learning, e.g., by improving student comprehension. - Whether teachers could accept the use of these systems as a component of their course was unknown. What this study added to our knowledge? - We focused on the perceptions of teachers of biomedical subjects, which have not been frequently considered in previous research. - The results of this study show that IIA systems that include the integration of reliable sources of information, concept extraction and bilingualism are valued by degree teachers, who also considered the incorporation of these systems into learning activities to be potentially very useful. - Under our experimental conditions, our results suggest that IIA systems may be easily integrated in their curricula. - The results of our study provide insights into the need to produce user-friendly IIA systems for teachers and the usefulness of such systems as a component of any existing learning platforms.

In this category, respondents were asked their sex, age, faculty or school in which they taught, subjects they taught, number of years of teaching experience, (subjective) level of English proficiency, students\u2019 perceived average level of English proficiency, and (subjective) level of computer knowledge. The answers to the last question were accompanied by clarifications on what the respondents meant by the levels they indicated. Category 2: Information tools and sources of information used in the preparation or execution of active learning activities. The questions were mainly open-ended to obtain information on the systems used by the teachers in the classroom and the manner in which they were used in active learning. The teachers were also asked which Internet information source they thought was the most important in their teaching. Category 3: Case-based learning (CBL) methods and the use of case reports. The aim of the questions in this category was to identify in greater detail the ways in which the respondents used CBL (if at all), the use of case reports in CBL activities, the origin of these case reports, and the language in which they were written. When the respondents were not familiar with this methodology, they were provided a previously prepared verbal description. Category 4: Intelligent systems and natural language processing (NPL) systems in the classroom. The questions in this category were designed to gather information on the respondents\u2019 knowledge of the three systems under assessment and to determine whether they used similar systems to prepare or execute learning activities in the classroom. When the respondents were unaware of such systems, they were provided with verbal descriptions. Category 5: Use of annotators. Category 7: Use of monolingual and cross-lingual concept extraction systems. Category 9: Use of concept/mental maps. In these three categories, the questions were designed with the aim of determining the respondents\u2019 level of knowledge in the aforementioned areas before being introduced to the systems under evaluation. After asking whether they understood the terms that defined these systems, the characteristics of the systems were explained to the respondents and introduced to them. Category 6: Opinions regarding the use of the BioAnnote annotation system in learning activities. Category 8: Opinions regarding the use of the CLEiM cross-lingual concept extraction system in learning activities. Category 10: Opinions regarding the use of the MedCMap mental map system. These three other categories included questions intended to evaluate the perceived usefulness of the three intelligent systems in preparing learning activities (Question Q1) and as a learning aid in the classroom (Question Q2) on a Likert scale. The respondents were asked about the three systems after being introduced to them. Category 11: How would you order the systems presented in terms of their usefulness in teaching? (decreasing order) After the interview, the respondents were asked \u201cHow would you order the systems presented in terms of their usefulness in teaching (decreasing order)\u201d. The aim of this question was to quantify the overall view of the usefulness of the presented systems. Appendix B Fragments of comments made regarding automatic annotation systems in general and BioAnnote in particular (1) \u2026 it is very interesting that a case or article may be annotated with one thing or another, depending on your needs\u2026 an activity could require 4 annotations, and the student would use them with supervised information sources\u2026 (this is) very clear, very clear\u2026 (2) \u2026 an activity may be used to introduce the students to a text in the context of the subjects they are studying\u2026 I would like you to extract words that are applicable to\u2026 it would be great if the system were connected to the resources that are normally recommended to the students\u2026 (3) \u2026 you can prevent them from looking for information in unreliable places\u2026 students commonly continue to use these unreliable resources even though you tell them not to\u2026 this way they also get used to using a more evidence-based references\u2026 (4) \u2026 it would be interesting if you could apply different quantities of concepts depending on the students\u2019 knowledge\u2026 for those just starting, it would be good to apply less concepts and better orient their search; those with more experience could handle more underlining\u2026 (5) \u2026 I do not need anything special to prepare for an activity\u2026 in my subject area, it is very important to deduce the meaning of some words from others\u2026 if the system provides me those words, it might be counterproductive\u2026 however, for more advanced students, it might be useful\u2026 (6) \u2026 if a database such as Wikipedia is used\u2026 perhaps there is no medical filter\u2026/[general explanation]/(this system may apply) a certain scientific rigor so that the students gain an understanding of an idea; that appears to be a very good idea (7) \u2026 especially for orienting students at the beginning of a course\u2026 to call their attention to the things they need to be aware of and the things that are not important\u2026/[general explanation]/\u2026it is a good idea, the information is quite complete\u2026 however, they would need some understanding of the case before they looked at the results provided by the system\u2026 changing the format of an activity often keeps students interested (8) \u2026 I seem to spend all day looking for the terms that the system annotates\u2026 I think it would be very useful for preparing activities\u2026 these words are not just of use to me, I can ask the students about them\u2026 I think the system is very good for preparing case reports and obtaining information about medical terms I have not used or do not recognize (9) \u2026 does one have to introduce the text oneself?/[Yes]/How does the system know these terms?/[using sources considered important by medical experts]/it seems very interesting\u2026 (10) \u2026 what allows the system to annotate these concepts and not others?/[on the sources included in the system\u2026 which were selected by a team of 2 physicians and 2 IT specialists\u2026]/\u2026 it is good with respect to the references; we already know the terms prior to performing the activity; I think it is more interesting for the students\u2026 I think this would be good for students, but it makes things too easy for them\u2026 having to work less is a negative factor\u2026and this type of searching also helps them to learn\u2026 (11) \u2026 it could be good for keeping students on track when searching\u2026 I think the teacher would have to use it and see how it works and then use it with the students\u2026 the students would need some prior knowledge\u2026/[general explanation]/\u2026 we have used something similar, not exactly the same, a pathology atlas via \u201cOcenet salud\u201d\u2026/[in that system you use concepts rather than complete texts, don\u2019t you?\u2026]/\u2026 true, you use concepts\u2026 this system could be useful for researching\u2026 Does it search for information in the databases you mentioned?/[\u2026 exactly\u2026]/\u2026 for the basic information, I think it is a good idea, especially for first year students\u2026 it would be very interesting if they could handle both basic and more complicated information\u2026 the system does not appear to be very intuitive\u2026 but I think it could be easily learned\u2026 Appendix C Fragments of comments made regarding cross-lingual concept extraction systems in general and CLEiM in particular (1) \u2026 the system can be accessed in both English and Spanish; can it cross-reference other information?/[\u2026 it might be possible to include sources in other languages\u2026]/\u2026 there are certain topics that you find in languages that hardly anyone speaks\u2026 for example, in Portuguese, there are some good studies in areas that interest me at the moment\u2026 or in Japanese, with respect to gastroenteritis\u2026 if the system could handle other languages, that would be really useful; there may be other tools that can provide the information for English and Spanish\u2026 (2) \u2026 I think it would be of interest given the number of foreign students we have or if you want to improve your use of English\u2026/[general explanation]/\u2026 Italian students, for example, could process the case in one language and obtain the information on their own\u2026 the system seems intuitive, you have the text and the concepts are identified in the system\u2026 and it extracts information that is relevant to the concepts\u2026 it is very good\u2026 it also provides visual information\u2026 the problem that I see is that the program performs the process that the student normally has to go through\u2026/[\u2026 perhaps (it might be helpful) to find a more complex causal relationship\u2026]/\u2026 of course, one could ask them to relate this information in a determined manner \u2026 (3) \u2026 for basic courses, this would be very interesting, until the students gain an understanding of the basic terminology\u2026 so that they use the right translations\u2026/[general explanation]/\u2026 it is good that it all appears on the same screen\u2026 this program is more user-friendly than the last program\u2026 (4) \u2026 I think it (the system) is very useful, especially to teach students key words in English \u2212that\u2019s key in making them take interest\u2026 it would be great to process case reports in English\u2026/[\u2026 the system does allow you to do that\u2026]/\u2026 this could provide a very powerful stimulus\u2026 it is perfect (5) \u2026 I do not think the extraction of the concepts itself provides much additional value to the annotation, but the bilingual feature could be very useful\u2026 it could be useful for obtaining the right terms in English when preparing activities\u2026 even though I might know a word in English, I might not be sure of how to spell it\u2026 (6) \u2026 I think it is interesting in both languages both in terms of activity preparation and when executing activities with students\u2026 (7) \u2026 it would be helpful to help some students read\u2026\u2026 some find this hard and this might help them\u2026 some words could be in English and others in Spanish\u2026 (8) \u2026 since I work with groups containing both Spanish and English speakers, when I have a case report ready, it would be very useful to be able to get the information directly\u2026 since the majority of case reports are in English, the cross-lingual feature would likely be very good\u2026 (9) \u2026 I can see how you use it, and its seems very good\u2026 you need to let me have a go myself\u2026/[\u2026 in the test in which the students used the program they had no trouble even though they were given no instructions about how to use it\u2026]/\u2026 maybe, but they were born with a computer in their hands!\u2026 (10) \u2026 I think it is a great system; for the students, it is great because medical terminology is what they find most difficult\u2026/[\u2026 the teacher with the tool can choose the information sources\u2026]/\u2026 the trouble is that most just search using Google\u2026 I remember a test in which I asked them what a tumor is\u2026 but the best quality content does not come out\u2026 they find clinical cases very difficult\u2026 they find clinical cases harder to explain than they do the meanings of concepts\u2026 one has to interpret the information coming out \u2212 which is great for students\u2026 (11) \u2026 it is good that it is in English \u2212 even better if it is in Spanish too, \u2026 for my students, who are older, it would be very good\u2026 it seems easy to use\u2026 Appendix D Fragments of comments made regarding systems for the construction of concept/mental maps in general and MedCMap in particular (1) \u2026 similar to the annotation system, this looks important to me; the idea of using diagrams for learning is a good idea, e.g.,\u2026 I have used this as a method of explanation rather than as an activity/[\u2026 these activities can also be tested\u2026 a text would have to be prepared\u2026]/it might be useful when reaching the end of a topic\u2026 after providing an explanation, they could make a map of the topic\u2026 I am going to use that idea you have given me\u2026/[general explanation]/\u2026 students often start to study something and they get lost\u2026 I can see lots of applications for this, e.g., having a graphic tree available throughout the class so that students can contextualize the explanations provided\u2026 (2) \u2026 it seems to be a system that you could use both to prepare and to execute an activity\u2026 I think you could do it all on the Blackboard\u2026/[\u2026 do you have any comments on its usability? Do you think it is intuitive? Could it be differently set out? Could it be used for other things?\u2026]/perhaps the format would need to be changed a bit; it is a bit difficult to read because it is all grouped together/[\u2026 it can be moved\u2026]/\u2026 for example, the explanatory circles should be adapted to the text\u2026 (3) \u2026 it would be a useful tool for studying and class preparation\u2026/[what about for students?]/\u2026 yes, for self-assessment\u2026/[general explanation]/\u2026 I think it would be very useful as an activity at the end of a topic, or as a study aid for students\u2026 it would be a good idea to be able to link the concepts of the concept map with the descriptions so that you do not have to pass from one screen to another (4) \u2026 it is a simplification, which may be acceptable for younger students\u2026/[general explanation]/\u2026 it might be good for the student since they work well with visualizations\u2026 but I do not like it \u2026 (5) \u2026 so, the system creates a mental map based on a symptom, disease or diagnosis, etc?\u2026/[\u2026 no, the system does not create a mental map, the user does\u2026 the system provides a diagram that helps the user make one\u2026]/\u2026 I see, similar to FreeMind\u2026 (6) \u2026 it is very good; the only thing that worries me is that the knowledge base needs to be adequate\u2026 if is it correct and up to date, etc., then perfect\u2026 if it is not, it could create confusion for both the teacher and student\u2026 the design looks great\u2026 similar changes would also be necessary for the other systems shown previously\u2026 (7) \u2026 this system seems as if it is really intended for preparing diagrams or presentations \u2026 for introducing graphical information\u2026 it is a bit like what you can do with presentation-making programs\u2026 (8) \u2026 it seems interesting as well, but I would probably not use it as much\u2026 since I would have to become very familiar with what a mental map is\u2026 the other part of the application seems more useful\u2026 as things stand, I think the other program would be more useful to me (9) \u2026 it is similar to preparing a class with three presentations that are closed but that you open up depending on what you want\u2026 that is probably what I like most for everyday use, it would make classes easier if they comprehend you, helping you leave things closed for the next day\u2026 (10) \u2026 the main problem is what the outcome would be when the system stops working\u2026 suddenly, you would have 50 students with their hands up\u2026 and it freezes/[\u2026 in fact, in the first system, we showed solves the problem of having to address many users\u2026]/\u2026 I have always had to take materials to class on paper just in case the \u2018virtual campus\u2019 system stops working. That is the worst thing that can occur during a classroom activity; if you can sort that out, it would be great\u2026 another positive thing would be if the system marked the activity automatically\u2026 (11) \u2026 it almost appears to be a diagram\u2026/[\u2026 exactly\u2026 it\u2019s similar to a diagram with semantic information\u2026 with relationships\u2026]/\u2026 in any case, it is very good, it synthesizes the information\u2026/[\u2026 the idea is for it to be used with case reports\u2026]/\u2026 but these data have to be introduced\u2026/[\u2026 what the system does, it does so automatically\u2026]/\u2026 so, what I do with these data is up to me\u2026 it is OK; what worries me is that the output could be very broad and the student could get lost; the more to the point and easier, the better, especially for first year students\u2026 you also have to take into account the fact that this instrument makes life easier\u2026 students are normally saturated with work\u2026 for me to use it, I would have to learn how to use it first; I\u2019d want that time invested to be worthwhile, i.e., that it would really help me prepare activities\u2026 it seems simple\u2026 Appendix E Supplementary data Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2017.12.016.

The use of intelligent systems can be of great help when designing and developing these types of activities. Recently, emerging disciplines such as \u2018educational data mining\u2019 and \u2018learning analytics and knowledge\u2019 have provided clear examples of the importance of the use of artificial intelligence techniques in education. Objective The main objective of this study was to gather expert opinions regarding the benefits of using complementary methods that are supported by intelligent systems, specifically, by intelligent information access systems, when processing texts written in natural language and the benefits of using these methods as companion tools to the learning activities that are employed by biomedical and health sciences teachers. Methods Eleven teachers of degree courses who belonged to the Faculties of Biomedical Sciences (BS) and Health Sciences (HS) of a Spanish university in Madrid were individually interviewed. These interviews were conducted using a mixed methods questionnaire that included 66 predefined close-ended and open-ended questions. In our study, three intelligent information access systems (i.e., BioAnnote, CLEiM and MedCMap) were successfully used to evaluate the teacher\u2019s perceptions regarding the utility of these systems and their different methods in learning activities. Results All teachers reported using active learning methods in the classroom, most of which were computer programs that were used for initially designing and later executing learning activities. All teachers used case-based learning methods in the classroom, with a specific emphasis on case reports written in Spanish and/or English. In general, few or none of the teachers were familiar with the technical terms related to the technologies used for these activities such as \u201cintelligent systems\u201d or \u201cconcept/mental maps\u201d. However, they clearly realized the potential applicability of such approaches in both the preparation and the effective use of these activities in the classroom. Specifically, the themes highlighted by a greater number of teachers after analyzing the responses to the open-ended questions were the usefulness of BioAnnote system to provide reliable sources of medical information and the usefulness of the bilingual nature of CLEiM system for learning medical terminology in English. Conclusions Three intelligent information access systems were successfully used to evaluate the teacher\u2019s perceptions regarding the utility of these systems in learning activities. The results of this study showed that integration of reliable sources of information, bilingualism and selective annotation of concepts were the most valued features by the teachers, who also considered the incorporation of these systems into learning activities to be potentially very useful. In addition, in the context of our experimental conditions, our work provides useful insights into the way to appropriately integrate this type of intelligent information access systems into learning activities, revealing key themes to consider when developing such approaches.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2018-04-30", "openaccessUserLicense": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386505617304677", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Aparicio, Fernando"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Morales-Botello, Mar\u00eda Luz"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Rubio, Margarita"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hernando, Asunci\u00f3n"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Mu\u00f1oz, Rafael"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "L\u00f3pez-Fern\u00e1ndez, Hugo"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Glez-Pe\u00f1a, Daniel"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Fdez-Riverola, Florentino"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "de la Villa, Manuel"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Ma\u00f1a, Manuel"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Gachet, Diego"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Buenaga, Manuel de"}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386505617304677"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386505617304677"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": "Full", "pii": "S1386-5056(17)30467-7", "prism:volume": "112", "prism:publisher": "The Authors.
