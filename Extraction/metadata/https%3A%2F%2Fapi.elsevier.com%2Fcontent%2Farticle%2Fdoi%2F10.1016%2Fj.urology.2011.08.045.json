Kaplan-Meier and life tables analyses targeted the rates of BCR according to pathologic parameters. Cox regression analyses addressed predictors of BCR.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  Median follow-up was 67.5 months. One and 10 patients died of prostate cancer (PCa) and other causes, respectively. Mean time to BCR was 83.8 months. The 3-, 5-, and 7-year BCR-free survival rates were 94%, 86%, and 81%, respectively. These rates were 97%, 93%, and 85% for pT2 disease; 94%, 84%, and 84% for pT3a; and 69%, 43%, and 43% for pT3b (P <.001). The same figures were 97%, 90%, and 88% for Gleason sum 6 or lower; 90%, 86%, and 75% for Gleason sum 7; and 85%, 65%, and 65% for Gleason sum 8-10 (P = .01). At univariable analyses, prostate-specific antigen, pathologic Gleason score, and presence of extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, and adjuvant radiotherapy were significantly associated with BCR. At multivariable analysis, the presence of seminal vesicle invasion and the presence of Gleason sum 8-10 represented independent predictors of BCR (HR = 5.14; P = .004 and HR = 3.04; P = .04, respectively).\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion\n                  We report the longest available follow-up in RALP patients. RALP represents an oncologically effective procedure. Our oncological results support the increasing diffusion of RALP for the treatment of organ-confined PCa.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0090429511023211", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090429511023211", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84655167716", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84655167716", "pubmed-id": "22088567", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84655167716", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20111116", "$": "2011-11-16"}}}}}
