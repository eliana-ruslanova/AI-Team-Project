Data were collected prospectively and reviewed retrospectively.\n               \n               \n                  Intervention\n                  RARC with totally intracorporeal modified Studer ileal neobladder formation.\n               \n               \n                  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis\n                  The overall outcome of RARC with a totally intracorporeal neobladder was presented by assessing (1) surgical margins, (2) recurrence or cancer-specific death at 24 mo, (3) 30-d and 90-d complications graded according to the modified Clavien-Dindo system, (4) daytime and nighttime continence (no or one pad per day) at 6 and 12 mo, and (5) satisfactory sexual activity or potency at 6 mo and 12 mo. Survival rates were estimated by Kaplan-Meier plots.\n               \n               \n                  Results and limitations\n                  Median follow-up of the cohort was 30.3 mo (interquartile range: 12.7\u201335.6). We recorded negative margins in 69 of 70 patients (98.6%). Clavien 3\u20135 complications occurred in 22 of 70 patients (31.4%) at 30 d and 13 of 70 (18.6%) at >30 d. At 90 d, the overall complication rate was 58.5%. Clavien <3 and Clavien \u22653 complications were recorded in 15 of 70 patients (21.4%) and 26 of 70 (37.1%), respectively. Kaplan-Meier estimates for recurrence-free, cancer-specific, and overall survival at 24 mo were 80.7%, 88.9%, and 88.9%, respectively. Daytime continence and satisfactory sexual function or potency at 12 mo ranged between 70% and 90% in both men and women. Limitations of this study include its retrospective design, selection bias due to the learning curve phase, and missing data.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  In this expert center for RARC, outcomes after RARC with totally intracorporeal neobladder diversion appear satisfactory and in line with contemporary open series.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Robot assisted"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Radical cystectomy"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Ileal neobladder"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Intracorporeal"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Studer pouch"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Complications"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Recurrence"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Continence"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Potency"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Sexual function"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Surgical margins"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0302283813005642", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0302283813005642", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84885420003", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84885420003", "pubmed-id": "23768634", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84885420003", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20130606", "$": "2013-06-06"}}}}}
