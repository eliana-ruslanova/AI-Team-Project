The automatic segmentation of SR-\u00b5CT scans is highly valuable due to its innumerous applications in geological sciences, especially for morphology, typology, and characterization of rocks. For a great number of \u00b5CT scan slices, a manual process of segmentation would be impractical, either for the time expended and for the accuracy of results. Aiming the automatic segmentation of SR-\u00b5CT geological sample images, we applied and compared Energy Minimization via Graph Cuts (GC) algorithms and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), as well as the well-known K-means and Fuzzy C-Means algorithms. The Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Sensitivity and Precision were the metrics used for comparison. Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's tests were applied and the best methods were the GC algorithms and ANNs (with Levenberg-Marquardt and Bayesian Regularization). For those algorithms, an approximate Dice Similarity Coefficient of 95% was achieved. Our results confirm the possibility of usage of those algorithms for segmentation and posterior quantification of porosity of an igneous rock sample SR-\u00b5CT scan.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "X-Ray"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Synchrotron Radiation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Micro-Computed Tomography"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Geological samples"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Image segmentation"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0969804316307886", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969804316307886", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85041359174", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85041359174", "pubmed-id": "29367125", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85041359174", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20171221", "$": "2017-12-21"}}}}}
