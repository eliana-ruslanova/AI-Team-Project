However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the MEC remain poorly understand. Here, we simultaneously detected, for the first time, the expression profiles of mRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs in four pairs of MEC and matched non-carcinoma tissues by microarrays. A total of 3612\u202fmRNA, 3091 lncRNAs, and 284 circRNAs were altered during the pathogenesis of MEC. The functions of these differentially expressed RNAs were predicted by Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. Co-expression networks of lncRNA-mRNA and circRNA-miRNA were conducted to uncovered the hidden ceRNA mechanisms. Moreover, NONHSAT154433.1 that associated with ADAM12 and hsa_circ_0012342 were further screened and confirmed using qRT-PCR analysis. In conclusion, this study provides a systematic perspective on the potential function of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in the molecular mechanisms of MEC. Among these, NONHSAT154433.1 and hsa_circ_0012342 might be served as potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic target of MEC.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Salivary tumor"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Mucoepidermoid carcinoma"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Long non-coding RNA"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Circular RNA"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X18325269", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X18325269", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85058921069", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85058921069", "pubmed-id": "30471855", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85058921069", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20181122", "$": "2018-11-22"}}}}}
