A total of 132 articles were ultimately included.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  New imaging technologies for the tympanic membrane (TM) and the middle ear cavity are being developed to assess TM thickness, identify biofilms and differentiate types of middle ear effusions. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied to train software programs to diagnose OM with a high degree of certainty. Genetically modified mice models for OM have further investigated what predisposes some individuals to OM and consequent hearing loss. New vaccine candidates protecting against major otopathogens are being explored and developed, especially combined vaccines, targeting more than one pathogen. Transcutaneous vaccination against non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae has been successfully tried in a chinchilla model. In terms of treatment, novel technologies for trans-tympanic drug delivery are entering the clinical domain. Various growth factors and grafting materials aimed at improving healing of TM perforations show promising results in animal models.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion\n                  New technologies and AI applications to improve the diagnosis of OM have shown promise in pre-clinical models and are gradually entering the clinical domain. So are novel vaccines and drug delivery approaches that may allow local treatment of OM. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: New diagnostic methods, potential vaccine candidates and the novel trans-tympanic drug delivery show promising results, but are not yet adapted to clinical use.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Otitis media"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Animal model"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "\n                     Streptococcus pneumoniae\n                  "}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "\n                     Haemophilus influenzae\n                  "}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "\n                     Moraxella catarrhalis\n                  "}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Diagnostics"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Vaccines"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Treatment"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165587619305865", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165587619305865", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85077165747", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85077165747", "pubmed-id": "31901291", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077165747", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20191227", "$": "2019-12-27"}}}}}
