Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery The First Hospital of Jilin University NO.71 Xinmin Street Changchun Jilin 130021 China Abstract This study aims to identify the feature genes associated with vascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, the RNA sequencing data related to vascular invasion in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, including 292 HCC patients with complete clinical data were included in our study as the training dataset for construction and E-TABM-36, including 41 HCC patients with complete clinical data was used as the validation dataset. Following data normalization, differentially expressed mRNA and copy number (CN) were selected between with and without vascular invasion samples. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was constructed and validated in GSE9828 and GSE20017 datasets. Total 59 feature genes were found by the SVM classifier. Using Cox regression analysis, three clinical features, including Patholigic T, Stage and vascular invasion and 6 optimal prognostic genes, including ANO1, EPHX2, GFRA1, OLFM2, SERPINA10 and TKT were significantly correlated with prognosis. A risk score formula was developed to assess the prognostic value of 6 optimal prognostic genes, which were identified to possess the most remarkable correlation with overall survival in HCC patients. By performing in vitro experiments, we observed TKT was significantly increased, but OLFM2 was decreased in high metastatic potential HCC cell lines (SK-HEP-1 and MHCC-97\u202fH) compared with low metastatic potential cell line Huh7 and normal human liver cell line LO2 using western blotting analysis. Knockdown of TKT in MHCC-97H or overexpression of OLFM2 in SK-HEP-1 significantly suppressed cell migration and invasion using transwell assays. Our results demonstrated that TKT and OLFM2 might be novel independent biomarkers for predicting survival based on the presence of vascular invasion in patients with HCC. Keywords Hepatocellular carcinoma Vascular invasion Support vector machine Prognosis 1 Introduction Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is considered as one of the most common and leading causes of cancer-associated mortality with an increasing incidence in the world [1]. Currently, some therapeutic approaches, including surgical resection and liver transplantation significantly elevate the five-year survival rate for HCC patients in early stage, but not appropriate for advanced patients, especially emergence of metastasis recurrence [2,3]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to prevent and manage the HCC metastasis and recurrence so as to improve the HCC patient prognosis. Nowadays, cancer research focused on microenvironment invasion has become a hotspot with the increasingly deepened understanding of HCC pathogenesis [4,5]. As a critical risk factor of HCC recurrence, angiogenesis is essential for tumor cell growth and makes aggressive tumor cells possible to leave primary tumors for distant metastatic sites, which plays an initial role in the process of metastasis [6,7]. Recent studies have demonstrated that the dysregulation of specific genes contributes to the progression of HCC metastasis from the view of vascular invasion. A study from Zhang et al. showed that FAM134B as an oncogene promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor metastasis in HCC [8]. RALY represents a poor predictor and promotes cell invasion in HCC cells [9]. On the contrary, CLCA4, as a tumor suppressor, has been demonstrated to inhibit cell proliferation and invasion of HCC by suppressing EMT [10]. However, these results from laboratory-based functional analysis on molecular alterations and pathway related to HCC metastasis are far from enough. The advancement of high-throughput technologies now enables us to have a comprehensive analysis of gene expression by incorporating into routine clinical prediction in HCC prognosis. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, https://gdc-portal.nci.nih.gov/) launched in 2006 by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) contains RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data derived from more than 10 thousand of tumor samples [11] and has been widely applied in identifying tumor biomarkers [1,12]. Another online public Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) database is provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) in 2000, which currently has been one of the most comprehensive gene expression data resources available, including gene chip expression and mass spectrometry data. Based on these two databases, we performed a comprehensive analysis for gene expression pattern and corresponding clinical information of HCC patients associated with vascular invasion from transcriptome expression, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and copy number variation (CNV) levels. In this study, whole RNA sequencing data related to vascular invasion from TCGA as training set and two additional datasets from GEO as validation sets. By screening differentially expressed genes (DEGs), constructing and validating Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, we obtained feature genes. Moreover, we constructed and validated the prognostic risk prediction model using Cox-proportional hazards regression and Kaplan-Meier survival curve and identified important biomarkers involved in the vascular invasion. Additionally, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis was performed for these DEGs. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Data source and group The mRNA sequencing (mRNA-Seq) expression spectrum data, including 373 HCC tissue samples (Platform: Illumina HiSeq 2000 RNA Sequencing) and SNP plus CNV information data, including 370 SNP detected samples (Platform: Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0) were downloaded from TCGA up to June 2, 2018. A total of 292 HCC patients with available clinical information, including with (n\u202f=\u202f102) and without vascular invasion (n\u202f=\u202f190) were enrolled in this study as training sets after matching the sample barcode. For validation purpose, two sets of gene expression profiles GSE9828 [13] (45 with and 34 without vascular invasion) and GSE20017 (40 with and 95 without vascular invasion) were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) database [14], which were analyzed in the GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array and GPL8432 Illumina HumanRef-8 WG-DASL v3.0, respectively. These two datasets were used as validate set one and two, respectively. Meanwhile, another HCC gene expression profile under the accession number E-TABM-36 [15] containing 41 samples with available survival prognosis information was obtained from EBI Array database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/) [16] based on GPL 96[HG-U133A]Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome HG-U133A as validation set. Statistical clinical information of patients in training set and validation set E-TABM-36 were summarized in Table 1 . Relationships between vascular invasion and the clinicopathological features in HCC patients from training set were listed in Table 2 . More detailed clinical characteristics of all HCC patients were listed in Supplementary Table S1. 2.2 Data preprocessing The expression spectrum FPKM data from TCGA database were performed background correction and quartile data normalization with preprocessCore Version 1.40.0 (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/preprocessCore.html) [17] in R3.4.1 language. The downloaded SNP 6.0 microarray data in CEL files were converted into CN segment expression profiles by PICNIC software (ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/cancer) [18]. Then, we downloaded human Gene annotation file (Release 27: GRCh38.p10) from GENCODE database (http://www.gencodegenes.org/releases/current.html) to annotate the genes involved in CN area coordinates. Simultaneously, the datasets from GSE9828 and E-TABM-36 were performed original data conversion, background correction and quartile data normalization by \u2018oligo\u2019 package Version 1.42.0 (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/oligo.html) [19] in R3.4.1 language. The expression spectrum data in TXT RAW format from GSE20017 were log2-transformed and normalized by median algorithm using Limma package Version 3.34.7 (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html) [20] in R3.4.1 language. 2.3 Analysis of differentially expressed (DE) mRNA and CN Limma package Version 3.34.7 in R3.4.1 language was used to analyze the DE mRNA and CN between 102 with and 190 without vascular invasion samples. Subsequently, logFC, p-value and the corresponding false discovery rate (FDR) were all reported by the Limma package. FDR\u202f<\u202f0.05 and |logFC| > 0.5 were set as inclusion criteria for DE mRNA and CN selection. By comparing DE mRNA and CN, their overlapping genes between with and without vascular invasion samples were screened, which was visualized using Cytoscape. In addition, the CN information containing CN variant (SNP, INS and DEL) was screened and reserved. Herein, A Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of these overlapping genes were performed using the DAVID version 6.8 (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) [21,22] with a p value < 0.05 as the cut-off criterion. 2.4 SVM classifier construction for vascular invasion The selected overlapping genes containing CN variant were used to conduct recursive feature elimination (RFE) analysis [23], which could screen the optimal feature genes in the training dataset. The optimal feature genes was subsequently utilized to construct the SVM classifier [24] for vascular invasion. The robustness and portability of the classifier were validated using the GSE9828 and GSE20017 microarray data. The classification effect was evaluated using correct rate, sensitivity, specificity and area under ROC curve as previously described [25]. 2.5 Prognostic classifier construction Based on the overlapping genes from TCGA database, univariate cox regression analysis [26] by the survival package Version2.41-1 in R3.4.1 language was performed to screen genes or clinical characteristics significantly associated with prognosis by log-rank test with a p value < 0.05 as the cut-off criterion. The significant genes associated with survival prognosis were entered into a Li-penalized Cox-Proportional Hazards (Cox-PH) model [27] using Penalized package Version 0.9\u201350 in R3.4.1 language to screen the optimal prognostic genes (The optimized parameter \"lambda\" in the screening model is obtained by the cross-validation likelihood (CVL) cycle calculation of 1000 times). The prognosis score (PS) in each sample was calculated according to Cox-PH prognostic coefficient as follows: PS =(-1.0714)\u00d7ExpANO1 + (-0.2671)\u00d7ExpEPHX2 +(-1.9019)\u00d7ExpGFRA1+(-1.2053)\u00d7ExpOLFM2 + (-0.3837)\u00d7ExpSERPINA10 +(0.327)\u00d7ExpTKT. The samples in training set were divided into high and low risk groups based on the median expression value of PS as cutoff, followed by Kaplan-Meier curve analysis [28]. The performance of the classifier was tested by the prediction accuracy in validation set E-TABM-36. In addition, stratification analysis based on clinical factors and risk factors was performed in training set. 2.6 Identification of prognosis related mRNAs and pathways The mRNA expression matrix in high and low risk group was statistically analyzed using Limma package with FDR\u202f<\u202f0.05 and |logFC| > 1.0 as the cut-off criterion. Next, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA: http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp) was conducted to identify associated mRNA KEGG pathways and p\u202f<\u202f 0.05 was used as cut-off criterion. The complete flowchart of informatics analysis was shown in Fig. 1 . 2.7 Cell culture and transfection The HCC cell lines, including high metastatic potential MHCC-97H and SK-HEP-1, and low metastatic potential Huh7, as well as an immortalized hepatocyte cell line, LO2, were obtained from the Cell Bank of Type Culture Collection of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). All cell lines were maintained in high\u2010glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% heat\u2010inactivated FBS at 37\u202f\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The siRNA against TKT (siTKT) and negative control (siNC) were chemically synthesized by GenePharma (Shanghai, China). The pcDNA3.1-OLFM2 (pcDNA-OLFM2) and pcDNA3.1 vector were purchased from Oligobio (Beijing, China). MHCC-97H cells were transfected with siTKT or siNC, while SK-HEP-1 cells were transfected with pcDNA-OLFM2 or pcDNA3.1 vector by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. 2.8 Western blot assay After 48\u202fh transfection, total protein was extracted using RIPA buffer (CWBIO) and the concentration was determined using BCA kit (both from CWBiotech, Beijing, China). Subsequently, protein of each sample was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to PVDF membrane (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The membrane was then incubated with primary antibodies against TKT, OLFM2, E-cadherin, Vimentin and GAPDH, followed by incubation with secondary antibody. Finally, protein bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (EMD Millipore). GAPDH was used as internal control. 2.9 Transwell assay Transwell assay was performed to determine cell migration and invasion using 8-\u03bcm transwell chambers (Corning Company, NY, USA) pre-coated with or without Matrigel, respectively. In brief, approximately 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f104 cells in 0.5\u202fmL medium without FBS were seeded into the upper chambers and 500\u202f\u03bcL of 10% FBS medium was added into the lower chambers. After 24\u202fh of culture, the cells that migrated to lower chambers were gently washed with PBS, fixed with methanol, and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. The migrated cells were photographed and counted in five random fields under a Nikon TS100-F inverted microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). 2.10 Statistical analysis All the in vitro experiments were in triplicates and repeated at least three times. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS18.0 software and the data were expressed as a mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fstandard deviation (SD). Relationships between vascular invasion and the clinicopathological features in HCC patients from TCGA database were analyzed via the Chi-squared test. Student's t-test was used to analyze the mean difference between two groups. Differences were considered to be statistically significant for p < 0.05. 3 Results 3.1 Data preprocessing Firstly, the gene expression profile data downloaded from TCGA and GEO were standardized, which were shown in Table S2. The downloaded CN segment expression profiles were applied to gene annotation in detected area and display different chromosome distribution. As shown in Fig. 2 , the CN signals in all tumor samples is highly similar, which suggests that the existence of some CN signals is not accidental but unique to tumor samples. The detail CN signal values were listed in Table 3S. 3.2 Identification of DE mRNA and CN After data preprocessing and normalization, Limma packages in R language analysis were used to identify DE mRNA and CN between 102 with and 190 without vascular invasion samples derived from TCGA database. According to threshold criterion (FDR\u202f<\u202f0.05 and |log FC| > 0.5), we obtained 1385 DE mRNA, including 515 down-regulated and 870 up-regulated, and 1403 DE CN consisting of 453 down-regulated and 950 up-regulated genes (Table 4S). By comparing DE mRNA and CN, total 143 overlapping genes were obtained (Fig. 1S and Table 5S). Then, we performed SNP information screening in these 143 overlapping genes and got 114 genes with variant locus, including 94 SNP, 7 INS and 13 DEL (Table 6S). Moreover, these 114 genes were inputted into DAVID for KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. As shown in Fig. 3 and Table 3 , these overlapping genes were significantly enriched in 19 KEGG pathways, including \u2018pathways in cancer\u2019, \u2018Wnt signaling pathway\u2019 and various metabolic signaling pathways. 3.3 SVM classifier RFE analysis was performed to further screen obtained 114 genes with variant locus to extract the optimal feature genes. The optimal feature genes were used to construct the SVM classifier basing on the training dataset. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the accuracy of the classifier reached 0.8341 in cross validation when the 59 feature genes were included (Table 7S). Therefore, the classifier comprised by these 59 feature genes was chosen as the final SVM classifier. ROC curve analysis showed the AUC was 0.969 in TCGA set. The SVM classifier was validated using dataset GSE9828 and GSE20017. The classification accuracy in GSE9828 was 92.41% (73/79). In GSE20017, the classifier identified 36 with vascular invasion and 90 without vascular invasion (total accuracy: 93.33%; 126/135). The AUC, Sensitivity, Specificity and ROC curves were generated (Fig. 4B). The classifier demonstrated high accuracy in GSE9828 and GSE20017, indicating this SVM classifier could accurately determine the type of vascular invasion in the sample. The optimal gene expression value files in the training set and the two verification data sets are shown in Table 8S. 3.4 Prognostic classifier construction Using univariate Cox regression analysis, 20 of 114 genes with variant locus have significant prognostic power (Table 9S). For identification of high-risk distant metastasis, we built a multivariate Cox regression model using clinical characteristics included in the training dataset. As shown in Fig. 5 and Table 4 , three clinical features, including Patholigic T, Stage and vascular invasion were significantly correlated with prognosis. These 20 significant genes associated with survival prognosis were entered into Cox-PH model. When the value of log2 (lambda) is 14.6167, the maximum value of CVL is -503.0818, as shown in Fig. 2S-A. Under this parameter, 6 optimized genes (Table 5 ) were screened by the Cox-PH model, including ANO1, EPHX2, GFRA1, OLFM2, SERPINA10 and TKT. The gene prognostic coefficient was shown in Fig. 2S-B. Subsequently, we constructed risk prediction model based on the Cox-PH PS of 6 optimal prognostic genes. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed that low risk group had better prognosis than high risk group in training set and validation set (Fig. 3S). After stratification analysis based on patholigic T, Stage and vascular invasion, we found low risk had a better overall survival prognosis in patholigic T, Stage and vascular invasion samples (Fig. 4S). Meanwhile, stratification analysis based on risk factors showed that Pathologic T and Vascular invasion are significantly correlated to the prognosis in the low risk and high risk groups alone, while Pathologic stage is only significantly related to the prognosis in the high risk group (Fig. 6 and Table 6 ). 3.5 Identification of prognosis related mRNAs and pathways Using Limma package, the mRNA expression matrix was differentially analyzed in high and low risk group. Total 1039 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened, including 239 down-regulated and 800 up-regulated in high risk group compared with low risk group (Table 10S). The DEGs between high and low risk samples were additionally identified using volcano plot filtering (Fig. 7 A). As indicated in Fig. 7B, the 1039 DEGs distinguished the samples of high risk from the low risk group. Next, these 1039 DEGs were applied to GSEA analysis. Total 8 significant KEGG pathways were summarized in Table 7 . Furthermore, 6 optimal prognostic genes were used for correlation analysis of prognosis in the total of with and without vascular invasion samples based on the median value of their expression levels. As shown in Fig. 8 , Kaplan-Meier curve analysis indicated that patients with lower TKT, but higher ANO1, EPHX2, GFRA1, OLFM2 and SERPINA10 had better survival prognosis. From results from Table 4S, we further found TKT was up-regulated, while the other five genes were down-regulated in samples with vascular invasion, in comparison with without vascular invasion. In addition, TKT and OLFM2 were also identified in the final SVM classifier. Therefore, TKT and OLFM2 might play an important role in vascular invasion of HCC metastasis. 3.6 TKT and OLFM2 regulated cell migration and invasion in HCC cells To investigate the biological role of TKT and OLFM2 in HCC metastasis in vitro, we first determined the expression of TKT and OLFM2 in several HCC cell lines using western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 9 A, TKT was up-regulated, while OLFM2 was down-regulated in high metastatic potential MHCC-97H and SK-HEP-1 cells, in comparison with low metastatic potential Huh7 and hepatocyte cell line, LO2. Subsequently, siTKT and pcDNA-OLFM2 were transfected to MHCC-97H and SK-HEP-1 cells, respectively to obtain TKT silencing and OLFM2 overexpressing cell lines. As illustrated in Fig. 9B, TKT was significantly decreased in MHCC-97H, while OLFM2 was increased in SK-HEP-1 cells, compared with scrambled control group. As expected, transwell assay demonstrated that the migration and invasion ability of MHCC-97H cells were remarkably suppressed after TKT knockdown (Fig. 9C, p\u202f<\u202f 0.01). Similarly, OLFM2 overexpression obviously reduced the number of migratory and invasive cells in SK-HEP-1 cells (Fig. 9D, p\u202f<\u202f 0.01, p\u202f<\u202f 0.001). Furthermore, the expression of E-cadherin was obviously up-regulated, while Vimentin was down-regulated after TKT knockdown or OLFM2 overexpression (Fig. 9E). 4 Discussion Vascular invasion begins the metastatic process and has been reported to be associated with poor prognosis after surgical resection in tumor therapies [29]. To our best knowledge, growing studies have discussed the association of gene expression with the initiation and progression of HCC, but these results still are not enough for understanding molecular mechanism underlying HCC metastasis. In this study, through analyzing the gene expression profile based on a TCGA dataset that included 292 samples with or without vascular invasion, total 114 genes with variant locus were obtained and enriched in 19 KEGG pathways, including \u2018pathways in cancer\u2019, \u2018Wnt signaling pathway\u2019 and various metabolic signaling pathways. Consistently, HCC progression was closely associated with cell migration and invasion involved in Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway [30,31]. Using RFE analysis, this study has identified a 59-gene SAM for vascular invasion. ROC curve analysis showed the AUC was 0.969 in TCGA set, 0.957 in validation dataset GSE9828 and 0.952 in GSE20017, indicating that the gene-based classifier has clinical application value for vascular invasion prediction. Next, we performed Cox regression analyses to evaluate whether the prognostic power of the 114 genes with variant locus was independently of other clinical variables. The results showed clinical factors, including Patholigic T, Patholigic Stage and vascular invasion, as well as 6 optimal prognostic genes, including ANO1, EPHX2, GFRA1, OLFM2, SERPINA10 and TKT were significantly correlated with prognosis. ANO1, a calcium-activated chloride channel, has been considered an important drug target participating in several tumors, such as ovarian cancer [32] and prostate cancer [33]. EPHX2 is a member of the epoxide hydrolase family and a putative novel therapeutic target in oral squamous cell carcinoma [34]. Similarly, GFRA1 [35], OLFM2 [36], SERPINA10 [37] and TKT [38] were also reported to be associated with tumor progression. In the stratified analyses, we found Pathologic T and vascular invasion are significantly correlated to the prognosis in the low risk and high risk groups. These results demonstrated that vascular invasion might be a critical clinical factor affecting HCC patient survival rate. Furthermore, we obtained 1039 DEGs between high risk and low risk group, including 239 down-regulated and 800 up-regulated. Based on the prognostic analysis, we found patients with lower TKT, but higher ANO1, EPHX2, GFRA1, OLFM2 and SERPINA10 had better survival prognosis. Notably, TKT and OLFM2 were highlighted as key genes used for the in vitro experiment validation. Our data indicated that TKT and OLFM2 were associated with HCC cell migration and invasion, which functions as oncogene and tumor suppressor, respectively. TKT is a metabolic enzyme that catalyzes key reactions in the non-oxidative branch of pentose phosphate pathway [39], which plays an important role in glucose metabolism. Inhibiting TKT activity could suppress in vitro pancreatic cancer cell proliferation by 39% and Ehrlich tumor growth in vivo by 90% [40,41]. Moreover, TKT was found to be up-regulated in peritoneal metastases and promote ovarian cancer cell proliferation [42]. In agreement with these facts, our KEGG pathway analysis showed TKT was involved in tyrosine metabolism and pentose phosphate pathway and in vitro analysis demonstrated TKT knockdown suppressed HCC cell migration and invasion. Relative to TKT, these are limited reports about the role of OLFM2 in metastasis. According to the function of OLFM2 on smooth muscle differentiation [43] and vascular remodeling [44], we thus speculated that OLFM2 might be another critical regulator in tumor metastasis. In summary, by performing a comprehensive analysis for RNA sequencing data and corresponding clinical information from TCGA, our study identified six prognostic genes were significantly associated with vascular invasion for prognosis prediction of HCC. Our results will provide novel insights into understanding the underlying molecular mechanism of HCC. However, more clinical samples will be needed to collect for validating these findings in our future work. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare no competing financial interests.

Here, the RNA sequencing data related to vascular invasion in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, including 292 HCC patients with complete clinical data were included in our study as the training dataset for construction and E-TABM-36, including 41 HCC patients with complete clinical data was used as the validation dataset. Following data normalization, differentially expressed mRNA and copy number (CN) were selected between with and without vascular invasion samples. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was constructed and validated in GSE9828 and GSE20017 datasets. Total 59 feature genes were found by the SVM classifier. Using Cox regression analysis, three clinical features, including Patholigic T, Stage and vascular invasion and 6 optimal prognostic genes, including ANO1, EPHX2, GFRA1, OLFM2, SERPINA10 and TKT were significantly correlated with prognosis. A risk score formula was developed to assess the prognostic value of 6 optimal prognostic genes, which were identified to possess the most remarkable correlation with overall survival in HCC patients. By performing in vitro experiments, we observed TKT was significantly increased, but OLFM2 was decreased in high metastatic potential HCC cell lines (SK-HEP-1 and MHCC-97\u202fH) compared with low metastatic potential cell line Huh7 and normal human liver cell line LO2 using western blotting analysis. Knockdown of TKT in MHCC-97H or overexpression of OLFM2 in SK-HEP-1 significantly suppressed cell migration and invasion using transwell assays. Our results demonstrated that TKT and OLFM2 might be novel independent biomarkers for predicting survival based on the presence of vascular invasion in patients with HCC.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2019-10-31", "openaccessUserLicense": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0753332219302197", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Zhang, Ruoyan"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Ye, Junfeng"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Huang, Heyu"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Du, Xiaohong"}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0753332219302197"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332219302197"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": "Full", "pii": "S0753-3322(19)30219-7", "prism:volume": "118", "articleNumber": "109274", "prism:publisher": "The Authors.
