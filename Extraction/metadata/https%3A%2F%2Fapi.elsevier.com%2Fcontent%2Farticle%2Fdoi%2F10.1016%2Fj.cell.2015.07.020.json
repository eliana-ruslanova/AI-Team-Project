Figure 6 Nonsynonymous iSNVs Are Overrepresented within Predicted B Cell Epitopes in LASV GPC (A) The fraction of iSNVs within predicted B cell epitopes. The observed fraction is compared to the expected fraction (\u2217\u2217p < 0.01, \u2217p < 0.05, binomial test). (B) Overlap between GPC epitopes and iSNVs. Epitopes were predicted separately in each sample (y axis) and overlaid with iSNVs from that sample. (C) Fraction of iSNVs falling within predicted T cell epitopes (p value = binomial test). (D and E) Binding of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to iSNV mutants in predicted B cell epitopes was tested in HEK293 cells. (D) Each circle corresponds to the normalized average mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) measured by flow cytometry of each LASV GPC construct carrying either wild-type or iSNV mutations (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Each tested mAb is shown on the x axis. The MFI was normalized to the MFI of the empty vector control for each experiment. (E) Binding to the GP1-specific mAbs 12.1F and 19.7E using constructs carrying either the major or minor population-wide allele at positions 89 and 114. For comparison, binding to mAb 36.1F, which requires GP2, is also shown. All MFI values are normalized to the MFI of binding to the GP2-specific mAb 37.2D. Error bars show the SD from four independent experiments; \u2217p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney test. See also Table S2 and Data S1. Figure 7 Biased Fixation of Nonsynonymous iSNVs (A) iSNVs that are never observed as fixed differences between consensus sequences have a higher N/S ratio in both LASV and EBOV. (B) LASV iSNVs are more commonly seen as fixed differences than are EBOV iSNVs. The data displayed in (A) and (B) are tabulated in the top two panels of (C). (C) Biased fixation of iSNVs at the population-wide level (\u201cAll iSNVs\u201d) and in a pair of M. natalensis (\u201cZ0947 iSNVs\u201d). At the population level (top and middle tables), the \u201cFixed?\u201d column indicates whether or not the minor iSNV allele is observed in any other LASV (top) or EBOV (middle) consensus sequences. The \u201cDAF\u201d columns indicate the derived allele frequency in Z0947, with derived/ancestral allele states inferred from Z0948. 1Fixation criterion: the minor iSNV is fixed (100%) in one or more other consensus sequences. 2The DAF is defined as the frequency in Z0947 of the allele not fixed in the Z0948 consensus sequence. See also Figure S7H and Table S2. Figure S1 LASV, Human, and Mastomys Sequences Extracted from Illumina cDNA Libraries, Related to Figures 1 and 2 (A) Illumina sequencing reads from the individual samples were aligned against LASV or the human genome. Each circle corresponds to a single library. (B) The amount of LASV genome copies in final cDNA libraries were quantified by qPCR, converted to copies/\u03bcl and plotted against the average depth of LASV coverage from the same library. Values were converted to base-10 logarithm. (C\u2013E) Illumina sequence data sets from eight rodents were combined and used for de novo assembly of the M. natalensis transcriptome. (C) Table summarizing the analyzed data. (D) Contigs (n = 7,028) generated by de novo assembly were analyzed using BLASTn against the nt database. The fractions of contigs belonging to specific taxonomic families are shown. (E) All unique M. natalensis open reading frames (ORFs, n = 4,850; > 600 bp) were used to find orthologous ORFs in relevant rodents and primates. ORFs from the individual species were concatenated, aligned, and a maximum likelihood tree was generated using RAxML (Stamatakis et al., 2005) and midpoint rooted. Bootstrap values (500 pseudoreplicates) are shown (scale bar, nucleotide substitutions/site). Based on our phylogenetic analyses it is clear that M. natalensis is more closely related to mice than rats and that the analyzed rodents are genetically more diverse than the analyzed primates. (F\u2013H) Alignment summary statistics for the LASV and EBOV datasets. (F) Average pairwise identity for the L and S segments in different geographical areas (nt = nucleotide identity; aa = amino acid identity). (G) Average pairwise identity for the individual LASV genes. (H) Average pairwise identity for EBOV from Central Africa and West Africa (2014 outbreak). Figure S2 Evidence for Reassortment in LASV Strains, Related to Figure 2 (A\u2013G) Multiple sequence alignments of L and S segments from each LASV lineage were constructed and screened for the presence of recombinant or reassorted strains. (A) Number of sequences screened from Sierra Leone and Nigeria (lineage II) together with the identified number of recombinants (0 total) and reassortants (3 total). (B\u2013D) The RDP \u2018BOOTSCAN\u2019 bootstrap support (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures) for the pairing between the parents and the identified reassortment events. The reassortant is shown in bold underlined text, the bootstrap support for the reassortant being nearest neighbor with the major parent is shown in blue, and the minor parent in red. (E\u2013G) The identified reassortants, parents, and relevant in- and out-groups were selected and L and S segment alignments were made followed by RAxML (Stamatakis et al., 2005) maximum likelihood trees of the individual segments. L segment (top) and S segment (bottom) trees were rooted based on the out-groups identified in the entire LASV tree. The reassortant is shown in bold underlined text, the L segment parent in blue (same as \u2018major\u2019 above), and the S segment (same as \u2018minor\u2019 above) parent in red. Bootstrap values (500 pseudoreplicates) are shown for each node. (A\u2013G) In support of these analyses, we also compared the full LASV L and S segment trees using a Shimodaira-Hasegawa test (Shimodaira and Hasegawa, 1999) and likewise found evidence for phylogenetic incongruence between the L and S segments (p value < 0.01). (H and I) Time-aware phylogenetic analysis of LASV L and S segments. Bayesian coalescent analysis was performed on the full-length (H) LASV L segments and (I) S segments from the Matched dataset (n = 179) and phylogenetic trees were created using BEAST (Drummond and Rambaut, 2007). Branch-lengths are proportional to time before present (years). Orange bars correspond to the 95% HPD for key nodes. Figure S3 Estimates for the Time to the Most Recent Common Ancestor Are Consistent across a Variety of Models and Data Subsets, Related to Figure 2 (A\u2013I) Bayesian coalescent analyses were performed using several different parameters and models (Batch 1 dataset; n = 95). (A and B) The tMRCAs for the L segment (A) and the S segment (B) were compared under a variety of models. Each column represents a single model. The spectrum of points in each column represent the median times to each node in the tree under a specific model, with the topmost dot in each column representing the estimated median tMRCA under the given model. For each segment, eighteen models were compared, including a variety of clock models (lognormal, relaxed, or strict), population models (constant, exponential growth, or Bayesian Skyline Plot), and codon partitioning schemes (rate heterogeneity but no explicit knowledge of codon positions [HKY], separate partitions for the first and second codon positions combined and the third codon position [srd06], or separate partitions for the first, second, and third codon position [3pos]). The HKY model of nucleotide evolution was used in each model; altering the model of nucleotide evolution to e.g., GTR does not alter the estimated tMRCA. (C and D) To test whether the estimates are dependent on the exact set of samples, we performed molecular dating on random subsets of size n (for n = 10 to 90), with 20 random samples chosen for each subset size. The median estimated tMRCA across the 20 random samples is shown (red line). (E) The time to the most recent common ancestor to geographic subsets of nodes was computed on the full dataset and on the geographic subset only for the L and S segments (MRU = Mano River Union; Nig = Nigeria; Nig_II = Lineage II from Nigeria; oNig = Out of Nigeria; SL = Sierra Leone). The error bars indicate the 95% HPD interval. For parts C-E the full L and S segment alignments with a strict clock, an HKY model of nucleotide evolution, and a constant model of population growth were used. (F and G) Each of the 95 sequences in the Batch 1 dataset were removed from the alignment, and a molecular dating analysis was performed for (F) the L segment and (G) the S segment. For each leave-one-out replicate, the time to the most recent common ancestor as well as to all nodes in the tree was plotted. Each column represents the spectrum of median node times for a single leave-one-out replicate, with the tMRCA (time to the root of the tree) the top node in the spectrum. The leave-one-out replicates are sorted from left to right based on the age of the omitted sequence, with oldest sequence omitted on the leftmost side of the plot. (H and I) Randomization test of the data for (H) the L segment and (I) the S segment. We randomized the tip dates in 20 distinct ways and examined the clock rate in the resulting models. The error bars indicate the 95% HPD interval. (F\u2013I) All runs were performed with the HKY model of nucleotide evolution, a strict clock, and a constant model of population growth. (A\u2013I) For all parts of the figure, each run had a minimum estimated sample size (ESS) of at least 100 for all parameters. Figure S4 Randomization Test within Geographically Grouped Subsets of Isolates and Root-to-Tip Linear Regression, Related to Figure 2 (A) We performed a randomization test on individual geographic taxa using L segments from the Batch 1 dataset (n = 95). We randomized the tip dates in 20 distinct ways and examined the clock rate in the resulting models. Molecular dating was performed on the full segment alignment with the HKY model of nucleotide evolution, a strict clock, and a constant model of population growth, and a minimum ESS of 100 for all parameters was obtained for each run. The error bars indicate the 95% HPD interval. (B) Linear regression of root-to tip distances versus date of isolate for the L segments in the Batch 1 dataset (n = 95). We performed a linear regression on the root-to-tip distances of samples versus the date of the isolate. We computed root-to-tip distances using the PATH-O-GEN program based on maximum-likelihood trees constructed using RAxML (Stamatakis et al., 2005). Figure S5 Codon Adaptation, Nucleotide Content, and Mutation Spectra of LASV, Related to Figure 3 (A) CAI of LASV to human and M. natalensis are highly correlated. Normalized CAI was calculated for LASV to human and M. natalensis hosts. Each dot represents a single LASV sequence. (B\u2013F) LASV from outside Nigeria have higher CAI. (B and C) Gene trees for (B) NP and (C) GPC are shown separately (the Z gene was excluded because of its short sequence length). The CAI (to human codon usage) was calculated for each branch, according to the maximum-likelihood ancestral sequence reconstruction (PAML) and converted to a Z-score (by subtracting the mean CAI across branches and dividing by the SD). Because Z-scores can be less than one, the minimum Z-score in each tree was subtracted from the Z-score for each branch of the tree, such that the displayed branch have length zero or greater (scale bar, scaled Z-score). (D and E) Normalized CAI to (D) M. natalensis or (E) human of LASV sequences using the full gene-sets available for each host (\u2217\u2217\u2217 = p value < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney test). (F) The average CAI (to human codon usage) of all Sierra Leonean strains minus the average CAI of all the Nigerian strains plotted across the LASV genome (window size = 1). (G and H) Dinucleotide frequencies in LASV strains from Nigeria and Sierra Leone. (G) Dinucleotide frequencies in the full-length open reading frames of LASV. (H) Dinucleotide frequencies of the first 699 bp of the open reading frames of LASV NPs from Nigeria and Sierra Leone. (I) LASV genome copies decreases over the course of an infection. Relative abundance of LASV genome copies (log ratio of LASV copies/\u03bcl to 18S rRNA copies/\u03bcl) over the course of an infection was calculated using qPCR. Only a small subset of patients with multiple blood draws were included in these calculations. Each color correspond to an individual sample. (J\u2013L) Intrahost variation not likely due to systematic biases in variant-calling or sample degradation/damage. (J) The number of iSNVs called using two different methods is congruent (Batch 1 dataset; iSNVs were called at 5% minMAF and filtered as described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures). (K) The number of LASV iSNVs called is not correlated with the number of human \u2018iSNVs\u2019, as would be expected if sample degradation inflated the observed intrahost mutation rate. Human \u2018iSNVs\u2019 were called by aligning all the sequencing reads back to the human genome. All LASV and human iSNVs were called at 5% minMAF with the same filters and settings using GATK. (L) Mutation spectra do not differ significantly within and between hosts. The legend shows exchanges (either iSNVs or fixed differences between consensus sequences) between each possible pair of bases. The mutation frequency distributions do not differ significantly between iSNVs and fixed (interhost) pairwise differences between consensus sequences (Pearson\u2019s chi-square test, p value > 0.2), in both Sierra Leone (SL) or Nigeria (NIG). As expected due to the longer evolutionary history of LASV in Nigeria than Sierra Leone, there is a significant difference in the interhost mutation spectra between these two countries (Pearson\u2019s chi-square test, p value < 2.2E-16), due to an excess of transversions in Nigerian strains relative to Sierra Leonean strains. Figure S6 Confirmation of Illumina iSNV Calls, Related to Figure 5 (A and B) Independent cDNA library preps and Illumina sequencing runs were performed for two human samples containing high numbers of iSNVs and iSNV frequencies were called for each run. (A) Sample G733 and (B) Sample G1727. (C) Unbiased Illumina sequencing and amplicon-based 454 sequencing were performed on M. natalensis sample Z0947. The iSNV frequencies were called and compared across the two sequencing technologies. No amplicons could be produced from the first \u223c1500 bp of the L segments so no 454 sequence data could be generated from this region. (A\u2013C) The x axis numbers correspond to base pairs within the two segments. The height of each bar denotes the frequency of the iSNV (the maximum likelihood minor allele frequency estimate). Error bars span the 95% confidence interval of this estimate, assuming a binomial probability distribution. (D and E) Amplicon-based (no cloning) Sanger sequencing was performed around iSNVs identified using Illumina data in (D) the L segment or (E) the S segment of sample G733. The identified iSNVs are represented in bold and minor curves corresponding to the identified minor allele variant calls can be seen in the individual chromatograms. In all cases, only iSNVs within the open reading frames are considered. Figure S7 Additional iSNV Analyses, Related to Figures 5 and 7 (A\u2013D) The number of iSNVs called reaches a plateau in most samples with increasing sequencing depth. Sequence data (Batch 1 dataset) was downsampled by randomly selecting subsets of the total sequence reads. The downsampled data were then used to call iSNVs. Each individual sequenced sample is shown in a different color, with (A and C) humans (minMAF = 5%) and (B and D) rodents (minMAF = 10%) plotted separately. (A and B) The fraction of iSNVs called (relative to the total called with full coverage) in (A) humans or (B) M. natalensis is plotted against the mean coverage per site (means across 20 replicate down samplings). Human samples often have > 1000x coverage; these were first downsampled to 500x, then further downsampled to fractions of 500x. (C and D) The same data, displaying the total mean number of iSNVs called in each downsampling and the fraction of total coverage from (C) humans or (D) M. natalensis (with total = 500x for humans). (E) iSNV frequencies are relatively stable over the course of an infection and vary across sites within individual samples. iSNV frequencies (5% minMAF) were calculated in samples where more than more blood sample had been collected over the course of LASV infection. Each color correspond to an individual sample; each line correspond to an individual iSNV. (F) Limited evidence for multiple infections. iSNV frequencies were calculated in all samples with \u2265 10 iSNVs (5% minMAF) and plotted as the percent of total reads. Each circle corresponds to an iSNV within an individual sample. (G) dN/dS ratios decrease with higher iSNV frequency. LASV and EBOV iSNVs were called at different minor allele frequencies and the dN/dS ratios were calculated. For iSNVs with minMAF < 5% only samples with independent replicate library preparations were considered and iSNVs had to be present at similar frequencies in all replicates to be called. (H) Transmission scenarios between rodents Z0947 and Z0948. Three different transmission scenarios are illustrated: (1) outgroup to Z0948 and Z0947 independently, (2) outgroup to Z0948 to Z0947, and (3) outgroup to Z0947 to Z0948. Here, the outgroup is G1190 and G1727. Only sites at which G1190 and G1727 share the same fixed allele are included. Circles indicate hosts (Z0947, Z0948, or outgroup), with black and white indicating alternative alleles at iSNV sites or fixed differences between consensus sequences. Different observed patterns of iSNV/fixed differences (A\u2013D) are shown. Patterns C and D are ambiguous because the Z0947 derived allele is sometimes the major and sometimes the minor allele, depending on the transmission scenario. (I) Nonsynonymous iSNVs are overrepresented within predicted B cell epitopes in LASV GPC. B cell epitopes were predicted in LASV GPC genes from M. natalensis and humans hosts using FBCPred. The observed fraction is compared to the expected fraction, which is simply the fraction of amino acids in LASV GPC containing predicted epitopes (\u2217\u2217 = p value < 0.01, Binomial test).

Like Ebola virus, Lassa virus (LASV) can cause hemorrhagic fever with high case fatality rates. We generated a genomic catalog of almost 200 LASV sequences from clinical and rodent reservoir samples. We show that whereas the 2013\u20132015 EVD epidemic is fueled by human-to-human transmissions, LASV infections mainly result from reservoir-to-human infections. We elucidated the spread of LASV across West Africa and show that this migration was accompanied by changes in LASV genome abundance, fatality rates, codon adaptation, and translational efficiency. By investigating intrahost evolution, we found that mutations accumulate in epitopes of viral surface proteins, suggesting selection for immune escape. This catalog will serve as a foundation for the development of vaccines and diagnostics. Video Abstract Graphical Abstract Highlights \u2022 Lassa virus is a life-threatening pathogen that is endemic in West Africa \u2022 Lassa virus has diverse and ancient origins in Nigeria \u2022 Viral strains from Nigeria and Sierra Leone differ in their translation efficiency \u2022 The virus evolves within hosts to evade immune-determined selection pressures Sequencing analysis of \u223c200 Lassa virus genomes reveals its ancient origins and distinct evolutionary features compared to the Ebola virus. Introduction Viruses that cause human hemorrhagic fevers, such as Ebola, Marburg, and Lassa, are classified as BL-4 agents due to their high fatality rates and lack of effective treatment (Paessler and Walker, 2013). With increasing globalization, changing climatic conditions and an ever-expanding human population, our interactions with these pathogens are likely to increase (Gire et al., 2012; Lipkin, 2013). The 2013\u20132015 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic (Baize et al., 2014) is a stark reminder that a better understanding of these viruses is required to develop effective therapeutics and vaccines, as standard containment and isolation can be insufficient to prevent large-scale outbreaks (Pandey et al., 2014). Lassa virus (LASV) is unique among BL-4 agents in being a common human pathogen, causing endemic disease in much of West Africa, primarily in Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and Nigeria (Figure 1 A). Infection with LASV can lead to acute Lassa fever (LF) with symptoms similar to EVD. LASV is estimated to hospitalize tens of thousands and cause several thousand deaths each year. Case fatality rates (CFRs) among hospitalized LF patients can exceed 50%, although numerous sub-clinical infections are believed to occur (Troup et al., 1970; McCormick and Fisher-Hoch, 2002). Most patients are infected by exposure to excreta from the rodent Mastomys natalensis, which functions as a reservoir and maintains persistent infections (Lecompte et al., 2006); human-to-human transmissions have also been reported, however, primarily in hospital settings (McCormick and Fisher-Hoch, 2002; Lo Iacono et al., 2015). LASV is a single-stranded RNA virus in the family Arenaviridae. Its genome consists of two segments, L (7.3 kb) and S (3.4 kb), which encode four proteins: Z (matrix), L (polymerase), NP (nucleoprotein), and GPC, which is post-translationally cleaved into two peptides, GP1 and GP2, that form the transmembrane glycoprotein (Figure 1B). EBOV (Zaire ebolavirus) is a single-stranded RNA virus in the family Filoviridae with a 19-kb genome encoding seven proteins. While the prevalence of LASV makes it a rare model for studying the evolution of a BL-4 pathogen, only 12 whole-genome LASV sequences were available prior to this study (Djavani et al., 1997; Vieth et al., 2004). Results Generation of a Large Dataset of Lassa Virus Genomes We established partnerships with Kenema Government Hospital (KGH), Sierra Leone, and Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital (ISTH), Nigeria, and collected samples from LF patients between 2008 and 2013. We implemented diagnostics, training, and infrastructure to ensure high-quality and safe sample collection from patients hospitalized with LF (Shaffer et al., 2014). We sequenced 183 LASV genomes from these clinical samples, 11 LASV genomes from M. natalensis field samples, and two genomes from viral laboratory isolates (Figure 1C; Table S1); we deposited all sequence data at NCBI (BioProject PRJNA254017) before publication. Most samples contained >50% human material and yielded <1% LASV reads (Figures S1 A and S1B; Table S1). Genome coverage was fairly uniform, with higher coverage of the S than the L segment (Figure 1D), consistent with a greater copy number of S (Southern, 1996). Since we used an unbiased sequencing approach, we were also able to assemble 7,028 unique open reading frames from the transcriptome of M. natalensis, a species not previously sequenced (Figures S1C\u2013S1E; Data S1). Lassa Virus Strains Are Genetically Diverse and Cluster Based on Geographic Location We first examined patterns of variation and phylogenetic relationships. We found high levels of LASV nucleotide diversity, with strain variation up to 32% and 25% for the L and S segments (Figures 2 A, S1F, and S1G). This is substantially higher than previous findings based on LASV fragments (Bowen et al., 2000), and much higher than EBOV, which is more than 97% conserved across all sequenced strains (Figures 2B and S1H). We confirmed previous findings (Bowen et al., 2000) that LASV clusters into four major clades: three in Nigeria and one from the Mano River Union countries (MRU) of Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia (Figure 2A; Data S1, S2, and S3). We found no evidence for host-specific clades of LASV lineages; rather, samples from humans and M. natalensis clustered together (Figure 2A; Data S1, S2, and S3). We did not identify any recombination events within segments, but did find evidence for reassortment between segments in three samples (Figures S2 A\u2013S2G). This could be explained by infections of individual hosts with multiple LASV lineages, followed by shuffling of segments, a process previously observed in vitro with LASV (Lukashevich, 1992) and in vivo with other arenaviruses (Stenglein et al., 2015). Lassa Virus Infections Are the Result of Multiple Independent Reservoir-to-Human Transmissions Recent studies suggest that the 2013\u20132015 EVD epidemic is maintained by sustained human-to-human transmission (Gire et al., 2014) after an initial \u201cspillover\u201d event from a likely animal reservoir (Baize et al., 2014). Similarly, it has been suggested that up to 20% of LF cases also arise from human-to-human transmissions (Lo Iacono et al., 2015). Sustained human-to-human transmission should result in a \u201cladder-like\u201d structure of the phylogenetic tree along with a strong correlation between a sample\u2019s collection date and its genetic distance from the root of the tree over a short time period. Based on data from the 2013\u20132015 EVD epidemic (Team, 2014), we defined that time period as one year. While collection date is strongly correlated with root-to-tip distance for EBOV from the 2013\u20132015 EVD epidemic (R2 = 0.64; Figure 2C; Table S2), the same correlation is absent for LASV sampled over a similar time period (R2 = 0.0001; Figure 2D; Table S2). Human-to-human transmission should also result in clustering of contemporaneous viral sequences on the tree. While this is pervasive across the 2013\u20132015 EVD epidemic samples (Gire et al., 2014) (Data S1), we found that only 5 out of 169 (3%) LASV sequences from patients resulted in such clusters (Data S1 and S3). As M. natalensis serves as the reservoir host for LASV\u2014and presumably maintain LASV diversity via sustained rodent-to-rodent transmission chains\u2014we would expect rodent samples to group into more defined clusters. Indeed, 5 out of 10 (50%) LASV sequences from M. natalensis formed clusters consistent with rodent-to-rodent transmissions (Data S1 and S3). Finally, we also found that the average pairwise divergence for EBOV lineages in Sierra Leone from the 2013\u20132015 EVD epidemic was much lower than that observed for LASV lineages within individual years from Sierra Leone (Figure 2E), despite similar observed substitution rates (Figure 2F). These three lines of evidence suggest that, while EBOV during the 2013\u20132015 EVD epidemic was transmitted through human-to-human contact, most human LASV infections represent independent transmissions from a genetically diverse reservoir. Lassa Virus Has Ancient Origins in Modern-Day Nigeria and Has Recently Spread across West Africa While EBOV and LASV were both discovered in the latter part of the 20th century\u20141976 and 1969, respectively\u2014their origins likely vary greatly (Commission, 1978; Frame et al., 1970). Reports suggest that all EVD outbreaks share a common ancestor within the last fifty years (Carroll et al., 2013; Dudas and Rambaut, 2014; Calvignac-Spencer et al., 2014; Gire et al., 2014). In contrast, the widespread persistence of LASV in M. natalensis, and evidence in the human genome of natural selection linked to LASV resistance (Andersen et al., 2012), suggest that LASV might be a long-standing human pathogen. Using molecular dating, we found that extant LASV strains likely originated in modern-day Nigeria more than a thousand years ago and spread into neighboring West African countries within the last several hundred years (Figures 2G and 2H). We first examined evidence for a molecular clock by comparing sample collection dates and root-to-tip distances across the entire LASV tree. In contrast to the shorter timescales analyzed above (Figure 2D), here we found significant evidence for a molecular clock (R2 = 0.38, p value < 0.0001). This allowed us to calculate the time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) using Bayesian coalescent analysis (Drummond et al., 2012). We estimated the tMRCA of sampled extant LASV strains to be a little over one thousand years for the L segment (Figure S2H; Table S2; median = 1,057 years ago [ya]; 915 ya\u20131,218 ya; 95% highest posterior density [HPD]) and 650 years for the S segment (Figure S2I; Table S2; median = 631 ya; 519 ya\u2013748 ya, 95% HPD). While LASV strains in Nigeria have the same tMRCA as all extant strains, those in Sierra Leone have an estimated tMRCA of only 150 years (Figures 2G and 2H; median = 153 ya; 137 ya\u2013171 ya; 95% HPD). We tested the sensitivity of our results to key analysis parameters that could severely affect our tMRCA estimates (Wertheim and Kosakovsky Pond, 2011; Wertheim et al., 2013). We found that our estimates were robust to the choice of all tested parameters, including evolutionary model, geographical separations, and exclusion or inclusion of older \u201canchoring\u201d sequences, e.g., the 1969 Pinneo strain (Figures S3 and S4 ; Table S2). In linear regression of root-to-tip distance of samples on the date of collection, the sequences from the MRU showed the strongest evidence of temporal structure, suggesting that the dating is most reliable within that region (Figure S4). Non-Nigerian Lassa Virus Strains Have Higher Codon Adaptation to Mammalian Hosts Previous studies have shown that viruses can adapt their codon usage to that of their hosts for translational efficiency (Sharp and Li, 1987; Bahir et al., 2009; Butt et al., 2014; Hershberg and Petrov, 2008). We examined the codon adaptation index (CAI) of LASV and EBOV to different hosts. CAI quantifies how well synonymous codon choice in the viral genome matches that of a potential host genome. We found that LASV had a higher mean CAI than EBOV, and a similar CAI distribution across different potential mammalian hosts (Figure 3 A). There was a strong linear correlation between the CAI of LASV to human and to M. natalensis, regardless of which organism LASV was sequenced from (Figure S5 A). In agreement with previous studies (Bahir et al., 2009), this suggests that codon adaptation to one mammal also leads to adaptation to another. We also compared LASV sequences from patients in Sierra Leone to those from Nigeria and found that the former had significantly higher CAI (p value < 0.001, permutation test) (Figure 3B). This apparent \u201cburst\u201d of codon adaptation as LASV spread into Sierra Leone began on the branch leading out of Nigeria and remained high in most non-Nigerian strains (Figures 3C, 3D, and S5B\u2013S5E), with an even distribution across the LASV genome (Figure S5F). As it has been suggested that dinucleotide usage play a role in determining translational efficiency of RNA viruses (Tulloch et al., 2014), we investigated whether there was a difference between Nigerian and Sierra Leonean strains, but did not observe any significant skew (Figures S5G and S5H). Lassa Virus Genome Abundance and Case Fatality Rates Differ between Nigeria and Sierra Leone Increased codon optimization might lead to increased viral output (Plotkin and Kudla, 2011) and therefore higher viral titers (Lauring et al., 2012) for non-Nigerian strains. With standardized inclusion criteria at our field sites (Supplemental Experimental Procedures), we tested this hypothesis by using qPCR to quantify LASV genome abundance. We found significantly more LASV genomes in patients from Sierra Leone than in those from Nigeria (Figure 4 A). LASV genome abundance in Sierra Leone was similar to that observed in EBOV patients from the same hospital (KGH; Figure 4A) and decreased over the course of the infection (Figure S5I), likely due to treatment with the antiviral drug ribavirin (McCormick et al., 1986). Next, we binned the LASV samples into those in the top or bottom 50% CAI from within each country, and compared LASV genome abundance between bins. In Sierra Leone, individual LASV sequences with high CAI tended to have higher genome copy numbers (p value < 0.05, Mann-Whitney test) but no trend was visible in Nigeria (Figures 4B and 4C). This suggests that CAI may affect LASV replication rate and abundance. Since increased viremia of LASV in LF patients is correlated with higher fatality rates (McCormick and Fisher-Hoch, 2002), we might also expect CFRs to be higher in patients from Sierra Leone than from Nigeria. Again using strict criteria for inclusion, we found a significantly higher CFR (p value = 0.01; Fisher\u2019s exact test) in Sierra Leonean patients than in their Nigerian counterparts (81% versus 60%; Figure 4D). While the treatment options for LF patients are similar in the two countries, other factors could also affect genome abundances and CFRs. In particular, delay in clinical care could bias our estimates; however, self-reported times from onset of symptoms to hospital admission are the same in the two countries (average = 9.3 days; Figure 4E). Nigerian Lassa Virus Strains Have Higher Protein Output than Do Sierra Leonean Strains Although we observed a correlation among CAI, viral genome abundance, and CFR, it remained unclear whether this is driven by differences in protein translation efficiency between Nigerian and Sierra Leonean LASV strains. We designed an experimental system to estimate translational activity for a single LASV gene with different CAI values. We randomly selected 20 LASV sequences from Nigeria and Sierra Leone and fused the first 699 bp of their NP genes (NP1\u2013699) to luciferase, before cloning into expression vectors for transfection or in vitro translation experiments (Figure 4F). Readout of luciferase activity allowed us to detect differences in translational activity of the chimeric transcripts. As controls, we codon-optimized one LASV sequence from Nigeria and one from Sierra Leone, for an upper bound on NP1\u2013699-luciferase translational efficiency. For both transfection and in vitro translation experiments, we observed a significant difference in translational output of the tested NP1\u2013699-luciferase genes, with Nigerian versions having higher outputs (Figures 4G and 4H). This was the opposite of the expectation based on CAI because the Sierra Leonean sequences had higher CAI (Table S2). Nigerian versions also had higher outputs for the codon-optimized forms of NP1\u2212699 (Figure 4H), suggesting that Nigerian sequences are intrinsically more efficient or stable. To test whether these observations were specific to NP, we repeated the in vitro translation experiment using the first 736 bp of ten LASV GPC genes (Figure 4F). Once again, we found that Nigerian genes had significantly higher translational output (Figure 4I). These results suggest that there is a difference in the translational output between LASV strains from Nigeria and Sierra Leone that is independent of the variation in CAI. Lassa Virus Is a More Diverse Intrahost than Is Ebola Virus The long-term evolution of viruses ultimately depends on mutation and selection within individual hosts (Parameswaran et al., 2012). Our deep sequencing allowed us to examine LASV intrahost single-nucleotide variants (iSNVs) within individual human and rodent hosts (Figure 5 A). We called variants at a minimum minor allele frequency (minMAF) of 5% and applied stringent filtering (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We validated subsets of iSNVs using different sequencing technologies and found that our results were consistent across platforms, experimental replicates, library preparations, and variant calling methods (Figures S5 J\u2013S5L and S6). We found that M. natalensis generally harbors more LASV iSNVs than humans (median iSNVs/kb = 1.5 versus 0.1; p value < 0.0001; Mann-Whitney test), consistent with longer, more chronic infections (Figures 5B and S7A\u2013S7D). LASV is a significantly more diverse intrahost than is EBOV (accounting for differences in sequence coverage between the two; median bp coverage \u223c2,000\u00d7 for EBOV [Gire et al., 2014] and \u223c250\u00d7 for LASV; Figure 1C; p value = 0.0005; Mann-Whitney test), with an average number of iSNVs per covered site of 2.1 \u00d7 10\u22123 in LF patients, but only 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22124 in EVD patients (Figure 5C). This difference is primarily driven by a subset of LASV-infected individuals that have >15 iSNVs\u2014diversity similar to that observed in M. natalensis (Figure 5C). Such high diversity\u2014with iSNV frequencies that appear stable over the course of infection (Figure S7E)\u2014was never observed in EVD patients (Figures 5B and 5C). LF is generally considered an acute disease in humans (McCormick and Fisher-Hoch, 2002), but high numbers of iSNVs could be explained by long-term chronic infections and/or adaptive evolution of LASV. An alternative explanation is multiple infections; however, the wide range of allele frequencies (Figure S7F) and general lack of linkage between iSNVs (Table S2) argues against this being the prevailing explanation. In addition, the vast majority of iSNVs (94.4%) are transitions, rather than transversion mutations (Figure S5L), which accumulate over longer evolutionary timescales (Wakeley, 1996). This suggests that most iSNVs are evolutionarily recent and that LASV iSNVs arise mostly via de novo mutation within hosts, and more rarely via transmission and multiple infections by circulating strains. Natural Selection Is Acting on the Lassa Virus Glycoprotein Next, we investigated the role of natural selection in shaping intrahost variation. In LASV, we observed a significantly higher dN/dS (p value = 0.0013; permuted McDonald-Kreitman test)\u2014a measure of selective constraint at the protein level\u2014within hosts than between hosts (Figure 5D). For EBOV, the trend was in the same direction but was not statistically significant (Figure 5D). Assuming that dN represents mostly deleterious mutations (Shapiro et al., 2009), this is consistent with these mutations being purged by purifying selection over evolutionary time (Rocha et al., 2006). Because purifying selection has less time to act within a single host, dN/dS is higher within hosts than between. However, the dN/dS of \u223c0.2 for LASV iSNVs is still much less than \u223c1 expected in the absence of any selection (Anisimova and Liberles, 2007). In contrast, iSNVs in certain other viruses, such as dengue, approach the neutral expectation of dN/dS \u223c1 (Holmes, 2003). Also, reflecting purifying selection on LASV within hosts, the dN/dS ratio appears to decrease at higher iSNV frequencies (Figure S7G). EBOV intrahost dN/dS is higher than LASV (Figure 5D), consistent with LASV intrahost populations being subject to stronger (or a longer duration of) purifying selection. Intrahost dN/dS varied widely across LASV genes, suggesting different selective pressures on individual genes. Most notably, GPC genes sequenced from both human and M. natalensis, had a significantly higher dN/dS ratio within hosts than between hosts (Figure 5E). GPC encodes the only protein partially exposed on the outside of the LASV particle (Figure 1B). It has a significantly higher within-host dN/dS than does NP (p value < 0.05; Fisher\u2019s exact test), the neighboring gene on the S segment (Figure 5E), but similar between-host dN/dS. These results suggest either a GPC-specific relaxation of within-host purifying selection or within-host diversifying (positive) selection (Baum et al., 2003). Nonsynonymous Lassa Virus Intrahost Variants Accumulate in Predicted Epitopes in the Glycoprotein We hypothesized that immune pressures on LASV GPC could drive within-host diversifying selection, favoring nonsynonymous iSNVs that impair immune detection by disrupting epitopes. This phenomenon has been reported for other viruses; e.g., at the population-wide level in pandemic influenza A virus (Bhatt et al., 2011). To evaluate whether iSNVs disrupt epitopes, we used a machine-learning method (El-Manzalawy et al., 2008) to predict linear B cell epitopes in each LASV protein. Nonsynonymous iSNVs in LASV GPC occurred in predicted B cell epitopes significantly more than expected by chance (Figures 6A and 6B; p value < 0.01; binomial test). This was true for LASV samples from patients and M. natalensis independently, although the signal was stronger in patients (Figure 6A). In contrast, synonymous iSNVs were randomly distributed across GPC, consistent with their lack of impact on epitope structure (Figures 6A and 6B). We observed a similar but weaker trend for NP, although this difference only reached statistical significance in M. natalensis (Figure 6A). To test if nonsynonymous iSNVs interfere with B cell epitope recognition, we reran the B cell epitope predictions, changing single amino acids within the epitopes from the consensus call to the iSNV variant. For 14 of the 18 predicted B cell epitopes, changing the iSNV from the consensus to the variant allele significantly reduced the epitope score (Table S2; p value = 0.015, Sign test). To test if nonsynonymous iSNVs also appear to fall within T cell epitopes, we predicted T cell epitopes in each LASV protein (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We found that nonsynonymous iSNVs accumulated to some extent in LASV GPC, although the results did not reach statistical significance (Figure 6C; p value = 0.07; binomial test). Intrahost Variants Interfere with Antibody Binding To investigate the functional effects of a subset of LASV iSNVs, we created iSNV mutations in predicted B cell epitopes in GP1 (Supplemental Experimental Procedures), expressed them in HEK293 cells, and tested their binding to a panel of GPC-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) using flow cytometry. These mutations led to a significant drop in the average mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for GP1-specific mAbs (Figure 6D), consistent with diminished mAb binding. Similarly, when we investigated the effects of single-point mutations within GP1 epitopes, we found that minor alleles in the LASV population displayed significantly reduced binding to GP1-specific mAbs (Figure 6E). These observations suggest that the host adaptive immune system imposes selective pressures on the intrahost viral population, driving an accumulation of nonsynonymous iSNVs in LASV GPC. Nonsynonymous Lassa Virus Intrahost Variants Tend Not to Become Fixed in Other Hosts To further explore the evolution of LASV within and between hosts, we investigated how often iSNVs become fixed in other consensus sequences. We defined an iSNV as \u201cfixed\u201d if its minor allelic variant was observed in one or more LASV consensus sequences. We observed a significantly higher nonsynonymous-to-synonymous ratio (N/S) for unfixed compared to fixed iSNVs (Figure 7 A), suggesting a selective bias against the fixation of nonsynonymous iSNVs. LASV and EBOV both have similar numbers of unfixed iSNVs, but LASV has many more fixed iSNVs, likely due to higher rates of iSNV fixation (or transmission) in LASV than in EBOV (Figure 7B). However, the putative transmitted (fixed) iSNVs tend to be biased toward synonymous mutations. This bias is much stronger in LASV (Figure 7C, top) but still detectable in EBOV (Figure 7C, middle). The bias cannot be attributed to differences in minor allele frequencies between nonsynonymous and synonymous iSNVs (p value > 0.1; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) or to a correlation between MAF and prevalence in consensus sequences (p value > 0.1 for both N and S; Pearson\u2019s correlation); therefore, it is best attributed to selection against transmission and/or fixation of nonsynonymous iSNVs. A single suspected transmission event, between a pair of M. natalensis captured on the same day from the same household, provided an opportunity to observe iSNV fixation dynamics on short timescales. The two samples, Z0947 and Z0948, are nearest-neighbors on the LASV phylogeny (Data S1, S2, and S3), suggesting recent (but not necessarily direct) transmission (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Assuming that transmission occurred from Z0948 to Z0947, we observed that derived alleles reaching high frequency (DAF > 0.5) in Z0947 tended to be nonsynonymous, while derived alleles remaining at lower frequency (DAF < 0.5) were always synonymous (Figure 7C, bottom). Other transmission scenarios (Figure S7H; Supplemental Experimental Procedures) also confirm that nonsynonymous iSNVs reach high frequency within a host, but fail to be transmitted to the next host. Along with the dN/dS and epitope analyses, this supports a model in which nonsynonymous iSNVs rise to high frequency within an individual due to positive selection, but are less likely to become fixed in other hosts due to purifying selection. Discussion Comparing Ebola Virus and Lassa Virus Evolutionary Dynamics EBOV and LASV are RNA viruses that can lead to illnesses with similar clinical symptoms, yet they differ markedly in their epidemiology and evolutionary dynamics. LASV is more than an order of magnitude more diverse than EBOV (Figure 2B), and molecular dating suggests that it has been circulating in Nigeria for over a thousand years, followed by a more recent spread across West Africa (Figure 2G). In contrast, it has been suggested that the Makona variant of EBOV responsible for the EVD epidemic in West Africa was introduced over the last decade (Dudas and Rambaut, 2014; Calvignac-Spencer et al., 2014; Gire et al., 2014). These analyses, however, provide lower-bound tMRCA estimates of sampled (extant) viral lineages; the true ages of all LASV and EBOV lineages are likely much older (Taylor et al., 2010). Because of limited sampling from Guinea and Liberia, our LASV dating analysis is likely most accurate within Sierra Leone, although we achieved comparable results when considering the entire dataset or the individual regions alone (Figure S3E). Furthermore, our 400-year-old \u201cout of Nigeria\u201d estimate relies on a single sequence from the Ivory Coast; additional sampling outside the MRU and Nigeria could push back this date. Because of the high heterogeneity among LASV lineages, continuous monitoring of its mutational spectrum and evolutionary change will be critical for the development of effective vaccines and diagnostics. Since LASV strains cluster by geography, it is more conserved within individual countries. For example, average sequence identity among lineages from Sierra Leone is 90% at the nucleotide level and 95% at the amino acid level (Figure S1F). A useful strategy might therefore be to develop diagnostics, vaccines, and sequence-specific therapeutics that are country specific or that target the most conserved features of the viral genome. The 2013\u20132015 West African EVD epidemic likely originated from a single zoonotic transmission event (Baize et al., 2014), followed by sustained human-to-human transmission and clock-like, linear accumulation of mutations (Figure 2C). In contrast, LASV has a clock-like signature on the timescale of decades (Figure S4B), but not on shorter timescales (Figure 2D). Combined with the intermingling of human and M. natalensis samples on the phylogenetic tree (Figure 2A), this is consistent with a genetically diverse pool of LASV being maintained in its rodent reservoir, with most human infections caused by genetically distinct viruses. A recent study suggested that human-to-human transmission of LASV may account for up to 20% of all cases (Lo Iacono et al., 2015), but we found little support for this in our dataset. This does not rule out human-to-human transmission entirely, but it suggests that human transmission chains are the exception rather than the rule. LASV is more polymorphic within hosts than EBOV, and M. natalensis hosts harbor more polymorphic LASV populations than humans (Figures 5B and 5C). Since most LF and EVD patients have 0 or 1 iSNVs, the difference difference between LASV and EBOV is mostly driven by a subset of LF patients with many LASV iSNVs (Figure 5B and 5C). LASV iSNV frequencies tend to remain stable over the relatively short period of hospitalization (Figure S7E), suggesting that intrahost de novo mutations and frequency changes may take time to develop or may occur early in the infection. These observations suggest that\u2014at least in some patients\u2014LASV infections could last longer than EBOV infections, allowing more time for the generation of polymorphism within hosts. Longer infections also provide more time for natural selection to eliminate deleterious mutations from the viral population. Consistent with longer infection periods in LASV, dN/dS ratios are lower within LF patients than in EVD patients (Figure 5D). While these findings are consistent with the existence of chronic LASV infections in humans, they do not constitute proof. Further studies are needed to verify the causes of high-diversity LASV infection and the prevalence of nonacute human infections. Compelling evidence could come from longitudinal sampling asymptomatic carriers of LASV, for example. Codon Adaptation, Translational Efficiency, and Genome Abundance We uncovered significant differences in genome abundance, CFR, CAI, and translational efficiency of LASV strains from Sierra Leone and from Nigeria. The increase in CAI of non-Nigerian strains (Figures 3B\u20133D), along with higher viral copy numbers and CFRs in human patients (Figures 4A\u20134D), would seem to suggest that the virus evolved toward greater human virulence. There are indeed many examples suggesting that pathogens with natural reservoirs may evolve toward greater human virulence, so long as they remain avirulent in the reservoir host (Ewald, 1994). We have not, however, been able to establish causality among these observations. While clinical care for LF patients is similar at ISTH and KGH (Supplemental Experimental Procedures)\u2014and time from symptom onset to hospitalization appears to be the same (Figure 4E)\u2014several additional parameters are beyond our control, including variations in socioeconomic, clinical, and human genetic factors between Sierra Leone and Nigeria. These prevent us from determining whether the difference in CFRs has a viral genetic basis and whether variations in CAI, viral genome abundance, and CFRs are causally linked. In addition, while we observed significantly higher LASV genome abundance in LF patients from Sierra Leone, we could not determine whether this difference translates into higher infectious titers. Controlled animal studies in BL-4 laboratories comparing strains from the two countries would help to resolve this important question. We expected that the increased CAI of Sierra Leonean LASV lineages would lead to increased translational output in an experimental system. Surprisingly, the opposite was true. Nigerian LASV lineages had significantly higher in vitro protein outputs than their Sierra Leonean counterparts (Figures 4G\u20134I). Translation-independent mechanisms, such as post-translational modifications and protein stability, could explain these observations, regardless of CAI differences. If the progenitor to Sierra Leone LASV strains indeed had lower translational output, the emergence of LASV strains with increased CAI could have been driven by positive selection to compensate. The higher CAI could then have led to higher viral titers in human patients. Alternatively, the increase in CAI could have been caused by genetic drift. Under this scenario, mutational biases (Supplemental Experimental Procedures) and drift\u2014combined with insufficient time for mutations to be exposed to purifying selection in Sierra Leone\u2014led to an increase in CAI, independently of positive selection. The Sierra Leonean tMRCA of the LASV population is indeed relatively recent (Figure 2G), having possibly undergone a recent population bottleneck (Lalis et al., 2012). Further work will be required to disentangle the adaptive and neutral contributions to the evolution of CAI and determine whether changes in CAI affect viral fitness and CFRs. Immune Selection on Lassa Virus within Hosts The observation that LASV GPC has the highest intrahost dN/dS (Figure 5E) and the most nonsynonymous iSNVs in predicted epitopes (Figure 6) suggests that it is a target of immune-driven diversifying selection within hosts, both in humans and M. natalensis. This effect was most strongly supported when we investigated the involvement of B cells (Figure 6A), although we also found weaker evidence for the role of T cells (Figure 6C). Given that human LASV infections are typically thought to be of short duration, it is perhaps surprising that there would be enough time for the host to mount an antibody response, and for viral diversity to be measurably shaped by this selective pressure. However, this is not entirely implausible, since it is known that LASV-specific antibodies appear relatively quickly, with experimentally infected nonhuman primates developing detectable IgM titers after 9 days and IgG titers after 12 days (Baize et al., 2009). Furthermore, it has also been shown that 25% of LF patients in Sierra Leone are IgM-positive upon admission and 10% are IgG-positive (Shaffer et al., 2014). Combined with the observation that several LF patients have LASV iSNV numbers similar to those observed in M. natalensis (Figures 5B and 5C), sufficient time for antibody-mediated responses has likely elapsed in a number of LF patients when they present at the hospital. We were unable to test seropositivity in our cohort, but future studies could assess whether there is a correlation between the presence or absence of LASV-specific antibodies and the number of iSNVs. Our prediction would be that LF patients with high numbers of LASV iSNVs should also tend to be IgM- and/or IgG-positive upon admission. Conclusions Our dataset of full-length LASV genomes yields insights into the biogeography, evolution, and spread of a hemorrhagic fever-causing virus. Further improvements in collecting, sequencing, and analyzing LASV and EBOV samples combined with concurrent experiments in BL-4 laboratories will allow us to pursue open areas of inquiry. The catalog of LASV genetic diversity presented here is thus an essential foundation for the development of vaccines and diagnostics for a highly diverse, continuously evolving, and unusually prevalent BL-4 agent. Experimental Procedures Ethics Statement Subjects were recruited for this study using protocols approved by relevant human subjects committees. All patients were treated with a similar standard of care. Samples All samples were acquired on the day of admission before any treatment regimens had begun. 10 ml of whole blood was collected, and plasma or serum was prepared. Diagnostic tests for the presence of LASV were performed on-site. Rodents (all from Sierra Leone) were trapped in case households and humanely sacrificed, and samples were collected from serum and/or spleen. All samples were inactivated in either Buffer AVL (QIAGEN) or TRIzol (Life Technologies), following the manufacturer\u2019s standard protocols and stored in solar-driven \u221220\u00b0C freezers. Case Fatality Rates CFRs were calculated from patients that had all of the following characteristics: (1) known outcome, (2) positive for LASV in the field, (3) confirmed positive upon retesting in the United States, and (4) sequencing confirmed the presence of LASV. Sequencing cDNA synthesis and Illumina library construction were performed, libraries were pooled, and sequenced on the Illumina platform. All the data were deposited at NCBI (BioProject PRJNA254017). EBOV data are available under PRJNA257197. Assembly of LASV Genomes LASV genomes were de novo assembled, followed by read mapping and duplicate removal. Trees Maximum likelihood phylogenies were made with RAxML (v.7.3.0) (Stamatakis et al., 2005) and rooted using the 1969 Pinneo strain. Molecular Dating BEAST (v.1.7.4) (Drummond and Rambaut, 2007) was used with a model incorporating a log normal relaxed clock, exponential growth, HKY\u03b3i with four categories, and codon partitioning (srd06). Intrahost Variants iSNVs were called and filtered taking into consideration minimum coverage, minimum frequency (5%), strand-bias, and base quality. Intrahost Selection A modified version of the McDonald-Kreitman test (McDonald and Kreitman, 1991) was applied to assess evidence for natural selection. Epitope Prediction B cell epitopes were predicted using BCPRED (El-Manzalawy et al., 2008). T cell epitopes were predicted using NetCTL (Larsen et al., 2007).

Summary tab: A summary of the generated sequence data. Primers tab: The oligonucleotides used in this study. Table S2. Analysis Data, Related to Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 Root-to-tip tab: The dates for EBOV and LASV strains used for root-to-tip versus date of collection calculations. The individual strains used for rooting of the trees are marked with \u201c1.\u201d CAI tab: CAI of NP-luciferase fusion proteins used in this study. CAI was calculated for the fusion-proteins containing NP1\u2013699 fragments fused to either firefly luciferase (fLuc) or gaussia luciferase (gLuc). Two of the NP1\u2013699 fragments were codon optimized before being fused to luciferase. Epitopes tab: Substituting major for minor iSNV alleles reduces epitope scores. All samples containing nonsynonymous iSNVs in predicted GPC B cell epitopes are shown. The epitope start position refers to the amino acid position of the consensus sequence, with the major iSNV allele. Replacing the major iSNV allele for the minor allele did not change the predicted epitope start position in the majority of cases: only four epitopes were offset by 2\u201310 amino acids but still overlapped by at least ten amino acids with the epitope predictions based on the consensus sequences. The epitope score assigned by BCPREDS ranges from 0 to 1, with higher scores denoting higher confidence predictions. Here, scores are multiplied by 1,000 for clarity, and epitopes that were no predicted after replacing the major with the minor iSNV allele were assigned a score of zero. The last column (sign test) indicates the direction of the change in score after swapping major and minor iSNVs: + denotes major > minor; \u2013 denotes minor > major. A sign test was performed using the direction of the change to assess whether minor iSNVs tended to increase or decrease epitope scores. Only epitopes containing iSNVs are shown (all other epitope predictions were unchanged). tMRCA - models tab: Key statistics of selected BEAST analyses run as part of this study. The final analyses were run on the matched dataset, whereas parameter comparisons were run on the batch 1 dataset (hpd, 95% highest posterior density interval; srd06, separate partitions for the first and second codon positions combined and the third codon position; 3pos, separate partitions for the first, second, and third codon; BSP, Bayesian skyline; exp, exponential growth). tMRCA - BSREL tab: Modeling branch-specific rate variation gives tMRCA estimates similar to those identified under a GTR\u03b3 nucleotide substitution model. We calculated tMRCAs for key nodes under a model that allows for site- and branch-specific variation in selective pressure, as it has been shown that molecular dating methods may severely underestimate the ages of viral strains in the presence of purifying selection (Wertheim and Kosakovsky Pond, 2011; Wertheim et al., 2013).Under this model, we again found our estimates to be consistent. Starting with our maximum-likelihood phylogenies constructed using RAxML under the GTR\u03b3 nucleotide model, we re-estimated the branch lengths across the phylogeny using a branch site random effects likelihood model (BS-REL), implemented in the HyPhy package (Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2011; Pond et al., 2005) (batch 1 dataset). We compared the node heights of the most recent common ancestors of key lineages on the phylogeny under the GTR\u03b3 nucleotide model and with the branch lengths re-estimated under the BS-REL model. The estimates of time in years use the median clock rate from the final BEAST analysis (9.63E-4 subst/site/year, L segment; 9.56E-4 subst/site/year, S segment). Linkage tab: Linkage between pairs of iSNVs sequenced on the same read (or paired reads). (A-D) Pairs of iSNVs are designated as nonsynonymous-nonsynonymous (NS-NS; red) pairs, nonsynonymous-synonymous (NS-S; black) pairs, or synonymous-synonymous (S-S; green). The number of sequence reads containing major-major, major-minor, minor-major, and minor-minor allele pairs are shown in the columns AA, Aa, aA, and aa, respectively. The DA\u2019 linkage metric is also shown for each iSNV pair (B\u2013D) or averaged across all pairs (A). Data S1. Raw Data Files, Related to Figures 1, 2, 5, and 6 Key data files, including Trinity-assembled M. natalensis open reading frames, alignments, trees, filtered iSNV calls (5% minMAF), predicted epitopes, and BEAST XML files. Data S2. Phylogenetic Tree of the LASV L Segment, Related to Figure 2 High-resolution maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the LASV L segment (matched dataset, n = 179). Bootstrap values (500 pseudoreplicates) are displayed on key nodes. The tree was rooted using the Pinneo strain of LASV (scale bar, nucleotide substitutions/site). The two different batches of samples are shown in black and red text. A uniform mixing of samples is shown. Data S3. Phylogenetic Tree of the LASV S Segment, Related to Figure 2 High-resolution maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the LASV S segment (matched dataset, n = 179). Bootstrap values (500 pseudoreplicates) are displayed on key nodes. The tree was rooted using the Pinneo strain of LASV (scale bar, nucleotide substitutions/site). The G-series and ISTH-series are both anonymized patient IDs with ever increasing numbers. Based on the ID and dates from Tables S1 and S2, potential transmission chains from within short enough time frames that could be suggestive of human-to-human transmission (short branch lengths) are shown in blue. While the observation of multiple cases within a short time period and clustering on a tree could be suggestive of human-to-human transmission, infections from a common source (e.g., a LASV-positive M. natalensis from within the same household) are just as likely explanations.

Like Ebola virus, Lassa virus (LASV) can cause hemorrhagic fever with high case fatality rates. We generated a genomic catalog of almost 200 LASV sequences from clinical and rodent reservoir samples. We show that whereas the 2013\u20132015 EVD epidemic is fueled by human-to-human transmissions, LASV infections mainly result from reservoir-to-human infections. We elucidated the spread of LASV across West Africa and show that this migration was accompanied by changes in LASV genome abundance, fatality rates, codon adaptation, and translational efficiency. By investigating intrahost evolution, we found that mutations accumulate in epitopes of viral surface proteins, suggesting selection for immune escape. This catalog will serve as a foundation for the development of vaccines and diagnostics.
