Data were prospectively collected: age, BMI, pre and post-operative eGFR (MDRD), operative time (OT), warm ischemia time (WIT), estimated blood loss (EBL), length of hospital stay (LOS), Clavien complications, pathological results and oncologic outcome. Tumor complexity was assessed according to the RENAL nephrometry score.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  Overall, 54 tumors were included. Median follow up was 26 months. Median age at surgery was 62 years. Median RENAL nephrometry score was 7 (4\u201310). Median WIT was 23\u00a0min (10\u201359). Median OT and EBL were 180\u00a0min (110\u2013425) and 100\u00a0cc (0\u20132500). Blood transfusion occurred in 7 cases (13%). Median tumor size was 45\u00a0mm (40\u201370). Three patients had positive surgical margins. Median LOS was 5 days (2\u201328). Nine patients presented post-operative complications of which 1/3 were considered as major (Clavien IIIb). Median pre-operative and post-operative eGFR was 88 (36\u2013136) and 75\u00a0ml/min (33\u2013122) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01), respectively. Two patients developed subsequent metastasis. The 2-year progression free survival (PFS) rate was 90.5%.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion\n                  Our results confirm that RAPN is a useful and acceptable approach for renal masses greater than 4\u00a0cm in size. When technically possible, NSS provides promising short-term cancer-specific survival rates with acceptable morbidity. Tumor size is not sufficiently discriminant enough and RENAL nephrometry score should increasingly used to describe tumor complexity.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Robotics"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Renal cell carcinoma"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Complications"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Nephron-sparing surgery"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S074879831300317X", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074879831300317X", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84878845116", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84878845116", "pubmed-id": "23566551", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84878845116", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20130406", "$": "2013-04-06"}}}}}
