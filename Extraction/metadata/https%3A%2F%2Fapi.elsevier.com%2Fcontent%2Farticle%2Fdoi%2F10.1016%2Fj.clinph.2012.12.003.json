The EEGs (1\u201360Hz), after removing artifacts, were decomposed into the conventional EEG bands. Using visibility graph similarity (VGS) and coherence methods, the VGS and coherence matrices in each EEG band were constructed. Then the Small-World Network properties, clustering coefficient (C), mean path length (L) and C/L, of the VGS and coherence matrices, were computed in all EEG bands. Then using the Mann\u2013Whitney test and an artificial neural network the differences of C, L and C/L between the two groups were evaluated.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  The MA abusers showed higher C, lower L and higher C/L at the gamma band (p-value <0.005). An accuracy of 82.8% in discriminating the two groups was obtained by the classifier.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  The topology of the functional brain connectivity is disrupted in MA abusers, as depicted by deviation from Small-Worldness in the gamma band.\n               \n               \n                  Significance\n                  This is the first but quasi-experimental study showing disrupted topology of the functional brain networks in MA abusers.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Coherence"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "EEG"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Functional connectivity"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Methamphetamine"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Small-World Network"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Visibility graph similarity"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1388245712007973", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1388245712007973", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84878115852", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84878115852", "pubmed-id": "23332777", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84878115852", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20130116", "$": "2013-01-16"}}}}}
