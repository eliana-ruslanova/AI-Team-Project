AFPs are present in vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, bacteria, fungi, etc. Although AFPs have a common function, they show a high degree of diversity in sequences and structures. Therefore, sequence similarity based search methods often fails to predict AFPs from sequence databases. In this work, we report a random forest approach \u201cAFP-Pred\u201d for the prediction of antifreeze proteins from protein sequence. AFP-Pred was trained on the dataset containing 300 AFPs and 300 non-AFPs and tested on the dataset containing 181 AFPs and 9193 non-AFPs. AFP-Pred achieved 81.33% accuracy from training and 83.38% from testing. The performance of AFP-Pred was compared with BLAST and HMM. High prediction accuracy and successful of prediction of hypothetical proteins suggests that AFP-Pred can be a useful approach to identify antifreeze proteins from sequence information, irrespective of their sequence similarity.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Thermal hysteresis proteins"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Ice binding proteins"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Freeze tolerance"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Physicochemical properties"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Machine learning method"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519310005849", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519310005849", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "78649326452", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-78649326452", "pubmed-id": "21056045", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/78649326452", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20101104", "$": "2010-11-04"}}}}}
