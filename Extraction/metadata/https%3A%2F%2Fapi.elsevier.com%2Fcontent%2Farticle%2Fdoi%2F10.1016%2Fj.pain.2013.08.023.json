Recent evidence suggests that the activation of astrocytes in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) contributes to the development of negative emotions during pain hypersensitivity after peripheral inflammation. However, it is unknown whether these activated astrocytes contribute to neuronal plasticity in the ACC. In this study, by using optical imaging with voltage- and Ca2+-sensitive dyes, we examined the long-term facilitation of neuronal excitation induced by high-frequency conditioning stimulation (HFS) in ACC slices of control mice and mice with peripheral inflammation induced by the injection of complete Freund adjuvant (CFA) to the hind paw. Immunoreactivity of glial fibrillary acidic protein in laminae II\u2013III of the ACC in the CFA-injected mice was higher than in the control mice. Neuronal excitation in ACC slices from the CFA-injected mice was gradually increased by HFS, and the magnitude of this long-term facilitation was greater than in the control mice. The long-term facilitation in the CFA-injected mice was inhibited by the astroglial toxin, the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist and NMDA receptor glycine binding site antagonist. The increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration in astrocytes during HFS was higher in the CFA-injected mice than in the control mice and was inhibited by l-\u03b1-aminoadipate (l-\u03b1-AA). These results suggest that the activation of astrocytes in the ACC plays a crucial role in the development of negative emotions and LTP during pain hypersensitivity after peripheral inflammation.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Optical imaging"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Long-term potentiation (LTP)"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Glia"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Emotion"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hyperalgesia"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S030439591300465X", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030439591300465X", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84889080505", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84889080505", "pubmed-id": "23988365", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84889080505", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20130827", "$": "2013-08-27"}}}}}
