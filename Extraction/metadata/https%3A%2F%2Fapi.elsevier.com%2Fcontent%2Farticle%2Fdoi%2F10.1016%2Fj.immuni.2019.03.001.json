Here, we examined the roles of dermal cDC1s and cDC2s during bacterial infection, notably Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes). cDC1s, but not cDC2s, regulated the magnitude of the immune response to P. acnes in the murine dermis by controlling neutrophil recruitment to the inflamed site and survival and function therein. Single-cell mRNA sequencing revealed that this regulation relied on secretion of the cytokine vascular endothelial growth factor \u03b1 (VEGF-\u03b1) by a minor subset of activated EpCAM+CD59+Ly-6D+ cDC1s. Neutrophil recruitment by dermal cDC1s was also observed during S. aureus, bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), or E. coli infection, as well as in a model of bacterial insult in human skin. Thus, skin cDC1s are essential regulators of the innate response in cutaneous immunity and have roles beyond classical antigen presentation. Graphical Abstract Highlights \u2022 cDC1s regulate the magnitude of the innate immune response to cutaneous bacteria \u2022 cDC1s control neutrophil recruitment, survival, and functions in inflamed skin \u2022 Activated EpCAM+CD59+Ly-6D+ cDC1s control neutrophil biology via VEGF-\u03b1 secretion \u2022 cDC1s secrete VEGF-\u03b1 in a model of bacterial insult in human skin Janela et al. find that during cutaneous bacterial infection, a minor subset of type I conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) control neutrophil recruitment to the inflamed site and survival and function therein through the secretion of the cytokine VEGF-\u03b1. Skin cDC1s emerge as essential regulators of the innate response in cutaneous immunity and have roles beyond classical antigen presentation. Keywords dendritic cell cDC1 XCR1 langerin neutrophil monocyte VEGF VEGFR recruitment activation Introduction Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional pathogen-sensing and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that are central to the initiation and regulation of immune responses (Schlitzer et al., 2015). The skin is a particularly challenging immune site, requiring vigilance for invading pathogens coupled with tolerance to self, environmental antigens, and the microbiota. In the skin, two subsets of ontogenetically distinct and functionally specialized conventional DCs (cDCs) exist: cDC1s, identified in mice as expressing CD103 (integrin \u03b1E) and XCR1; and cDC2s, expressing CD11b (integrin \u03b1M) and SIRP\u03b1 (Schlitzer et al., 2015). Within the epidermis there are also Langerhans cells (LCs), whose surface phenotype partially overlaps with both skin cDCs (major histocompatibility complex class II [MHCII] and CD207 [langerin]), CD24 and CD11c, and macrophages (F4/80) (Ginhoux and Merad, 2010); however, LCs arise from a distinct developmental pathway and possess unique functional features (Romani et al., 2010). Together, these APC populations sense and integrate multiple signals from the internal and external environments in order to initiate and shape optimal immune responses. These functions place skin DCs at the center of immune responses during pathogen infection and wound healing and highlight their relevance to allergic and autoimmune skin conditions, as well as skin cancers. A precise understanding of the roles of the distinct dermal DC populations and their interactions with other immune cells in the skin is necessary for the development of improved therapies for such pathologies. The delicacy and complexity of skin immunity is highlighted in acne vulgaris, a common skin disorder in which the pilosebaceous follicles become inflamed and infected, leading to pain, scarring, and often reduced quality of life (De Young et al., 1984). Inflammation in acne vulgaris is accompanied by elevated sebum production, abnormal cornification and/or keratinization of the follicle, and follicular colonization by the gram-positive bacterium, Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) (Bojar and Holland, 2004). P. acnes is a commensal of the human skin, mouth, and upper respiratory tract, but it is also an opportunistic pathogen (Fitz-Gibbon et al., 2013). The inflammatory response to this bacterium drives the development of acne lesions: high numbers of T lymphocytes (Kistowska et al., 2015) and neutrophils accumulate in the skin of acne patients and around lesions, where they can promote breakdown of the follicular wall, stimulating further inflammation, most likely through the production of reactive-oxygen species (Akamatsu et al., 2003). Similarly, in rodents, injection of P. acnes into the skin results in recruitment of polymorphonuclear cells, macrophages, and T lymphocytes (De Young et al., 1984). CD11c+ DCs are critical for hepatic granuloma formation in mice injected with heat-killed P. acnes (Ohteki et al., 2006), but little is known of the role of skin DCs in the pathophysiology of dermal P. acnes infection. Here, we examined the interactions of APC subsets with other immune cells in the skin during P. acnes infection and the effect of these interactions on the inflammatory response. Injection of P. acnes into the skin of mice was followed by successive waves of immune cell infiltrates over 30 days. Depletion of specific APC populations revealed cDC1s to be key mediators of neutrophil recruitment, phenotype, survival, and functions after P. acnes exposure. Single-cell mRNA sequencing identified vascular endothelial growth factor \u03b1 (VEGF-\u03b1) production by a minor subset of cDC1s (EpCAM+CD59+Ly-6D+ cDC1s), and further experiments revealed that cDC1-derived VEGF-\u03b1 is critical for neutrophil recruitment and functions in the infected skin. Our findings highlight the diverse functions of dermal cDCs in the regulation of skin immunity, revealing the importance of a specific cDC1 subset in the regulation of tissue innate immunity with potential relevance to a range of pathologies. Results Intradermal Injection of P. acnes Causes Ear Swelling, Successive Waves of Immune Cell Infiltration, and Fibrosis To characterize the longitudinal immune response to P. acnes infection, we injected 108 colony-forming units (CFUs) of live P. acnes into the dermis of the left ears of wild-type C57BL/6 (WT B6) mice, injected PBS into the dermis of the right ears as a control, and measured the resulting swelling at intervals over 75 days. Ear thickness was significantly greater in P. acnes-injected ears than in PBS-injected ears from 8 h after injection (P. acnes versus PBS control: 0.455 \u00b1 0.024 mm versus 0.236 \u00b1 0.018 mm; p = 0.0022) and throughout the experiment (P. acnes at day 75 versus PBS control: 0.29 \u00b1 0.03 mm versus 0.205 \u00b1 0.018 mm; p = 0.0119) (Figure 1 A). The greatest difference in ear thickness was observed on day 9 (P. acnes versus PBS control: 0.8 \u00b1 0.08 mm versus 0.216 \u00b1 0.017 mm; p = 0.0004), and then it slowly declined (Figure 1A). We observed increased opacity around the P. acnes injection site from day 4 after injection, consistent with a granulomatous reaction (Boros, 2013), accompanied by marked cellular infiltration (Figure 1B). Interestingly, sections from ears on day 70 exhibited increased staining for collagen fibers (Figure 1C), consistent with abnormal skin reorganization and fibrosis (Lattouf et al., 2014). To define the composition of the immune cell infiltrate during the acute phase of inflammation following P. acnes infection, we performed a comprehensive high-dimensional analysis of the ear cell populations from P. acnes- and PBS-injected ears at 12 h, 2 days, and 5 days after injection via mass cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) (Table S1) (Becher et al., 2014), allowing us to identify the different myeloid and granulocytic populations present (Figures S1A\u2013S1C). The CyTOF data were analyzed via one-dimensional soli-expression by nonlinear stochastic embedding (One-SENSE) (Cheng et al., 2016), which allowed us to first define expression of lineage-imprinted markers as the first dimension, thereby grouping broadly ontogenetically related cells together, and then allowed the other markers to define the second dimension, thus revealing any heterogeneity within the main clusters (Figures S1A\u2013S1C), as recently published for the analysis of murine tissue DC composition (Guilliams et al., 2016). The CyTOF data revealed within the Ly-6G\u2212 cell population (Figure S1B, green gate) the presence of LCs (turquoise), cDC1s (red), cDC2s (pink), CD11b\u2212CD103\u2212 double-negative (DN) DCs (green), mast cells (orange), Ly-6Clow monocytes (black), Ly-6Chigh monocytes (blue), and macrophages (violet). The remaining cells (yellow) were classified as monocyte-derived inflammatory cells (MCs) and had phenotypic features of both macrophages and DCs (Malissen et al., 2014) but were distinguishable by their expression of CD64 and low-intermediate levels of Ly-6C (Figures S1C and S1D) coupled with a lack of expression of the DC lineage marker zinc finger transcription factor Zbtb46 (Btbd4) (Figure S1E) (Satpathy et al., 2012). We then confirmed the presence and absolute abundance of these populations in skin cell suspensions during the first 30 days after injection with P. acnes via conventional flow cytometry (Figures 1D and S1F). Four distinct waves of immune cells passed through P. acnes-injected skin: from 8 h, neutrophils peaked around the end of day 1 and declined to disappearance around day 9; then Ly-6Chigh monocytes, which despite peaking at day 1 accumulated at high levels from day 4 to day 9 and declined between days 9 and 15 after infection; MCs accumulated from day 5 and peaked at day 9, consistent with their likely derivation from the earlier-infiltrating monocytes, and finally macrophages accumulated slowly over time until day 9 (Figure 1D); lastly, T lymphocytes infiltrated the skin from day 5 and remained abundant until day 15 (Figure S1G). cDC1s Are Required for Sustained Immune Cell Recruitment Following Intradermal Injection of P. acnes DCs control the hepatic granulomatous reaction to heat-killed P. acnes in mice (Ohteki et al., 2006). We therefore asked what role these cells play in the immune response to dermal infection with P. acnes. In Cd207 tm3(DTR/GFP)Mal mice, hereafter named Langerin-DTR mice (LG-DTR mice), exposure to diphtheria toxin (DT) induces specific depletion of dermal cDC1s and LCs (Ginhoux et al., 2007). We injected these mice intraperitoneally with DT and confirmed rapid and lasting LC depletion, coupled with significant reduction in the abundance of cDC1s in the skin from 18 h after injection (Figure 1E). Ear skin swelling in response to P. acnes injection was similar in WT and DC-depleted LG-DTR mice (injected 24 h after DT) during the first day of infection (day 1 P. acnes WT B6 mice versus day 1 P. acnes LG-DTR mice 24 h after DT injection: 0.498 \u00b1 0.043 mm versus 0.465 \u00b1 0.024 mm; p = 0.2641) (Figure 1F). However, from day 2, the mice lacking both cDC1s and LCs (LG-DTR mice 24h after DT) exhibited significantly less ear swelling than did WT B6 mice (day 9 P. acnes WT B6 mice versus day 9 P. acnes LG-DTR mice 24 h after DT-injection: 0.8 \u00b1 0.08 mm versus 0.373 \u00b1 0.02 mm; p = 0.0.0022) (Figure 1F). Thus, LCs and/or cDC1s seem to be required for the progressive inflammatory response to intradermal P. acnes injection. We then asked how the depletion of cDC1s and LCs affects the abundance of other immune cell types in the ears of P. acnes-injected mice. We observed similar numbers of neutrophils, macrophages, and Ly-6Chigh monocytes in the first 18 h after P. acnes infection in the presence or absence of both cDC1s and LCs (Figure 1G). However, from 24 h after P. acnes injection the absence of Langerin+ cells resulted in a significant decrease in the number of neutrophils, macrophages, and Ly-6Chigh monocytes compared with those in WT B6 mice (Figure 1G). This effect was neither a defect in neutrophil generation or egress from the bone marrow nor due to a defect in a possible egress from the skin to the skin draining lymph node because similar absolute numbers of neutrophils were present in the bone marrow, blood, and skin draining lymph nodes of DT-treated and untreated LG-DTR mice and in WT B6 mice (Figures S2A\u20132C). Even when lower doses of P. acnes (106 and 107 CFUs) were used, a lower neutrophil recruitment in the DT-treated LG-DTR mice than in WT B6 mice was observed in association with a dampened P. acnes-induced inflammation (Figure S2D). Together, these results suggest that the early recruitment of immune cells into the dermis after P. acnes injection is independent of Langerin+ cells, but from day 1, Langerin+ cells are necessary for sustained neutrophil and Ly-6Chigh monocyte infiltration. To distinguish the roles of LCs and cDC1s in this phenomenon, we exploited the differential repopulation characteristics of the two cell populations in LG-DTR mice. We compared mice injected with DT 24 h before P. acnes challenge, depleted of both LCs and cDC1s, with mice injected with DT 30 days before P. acnes challenge, in which LCs remained absent, whereas cDC1s had fully repopulated the dermis (Ginhoux et al., 2007) (Figure 1E). In the presence of cDC1s alone, inflammatory ear thickening in response to P. acnes injection was comparable to that in WT B6 mice and again peaked around day 9 (day 9 P. acnes WT B6 mice versus day 9 P. acnes LG-DTR mice 30 days after DT injection: 0.8 \u00b1 0.08 mm versus 0.72 \u00b1 0.036 mm; p = 0.0541) (Figure 1F); similar numbers of neutrophils, macrophages, and Ly-6Chigh monocytes were also present in ear cell suspensions from LG-DTR mice 30 days after DT injection and in WT B6 mice at all the different time points tested (Figure 1G). Interestingly, in the first 18 h after P. acnes injection, neutrophil infiltration in the absence of LCs was significantly higher than in LC-sufficient WT B6 mice, in line with the reported inhibitory role of LCs on leucocyte infiltration (Terhorst et al., 2015). Furthermore, we observed direct interaction between P. acnes and cDC1s because cDC1s were able to capture in vivo P. acnes (Figure S2E), and adoptive transfer of bone-marrow-derived cDC1s into LG-DTR mice lacking LCs and cDC1s (24 h after DT injection), at the time of P. acnes injection, reinstated the inflammatory ear swelling and neutrophil infiltration up to WT levels (Figure 1H). Together, these data show that cDC1s are both necessary and sufficient for the immune response to cutaneous P. acnes infection in mice. To confirm the critical role of cDC1s in this early inflammatory response to P. acnes, we used Batf3 \u2212/\u2212 mice, which exhibit severe defects in the development of cDC1s but retain LCs (Hildner et al., 2008) (Figure 1I). After intradermal P. acnes injection, Batf3 \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited a similar inhibition of progressive ear swelling (Figure 1J) and reduced levels of immune cell infiltration (Figure 1K), as did LG-DTR mice depleted of dermal LCs and cDC1s (24 h after DT-injection). Thus, mice lacking only cDC1s are unable to mount full and sustained inflammatory responses to P. acnes in the skin, supporting the key role for this DC subset during P. acnes infection. Similar results were observed in Itgax dta Batf3 \u2212/\u2212 mixed bone marrow chimeras, in which the Itgax dta provide a source of WT cells that are not CD11c (a marker typically expressed by DCs), whereas BATF3-dependent cDC1s are absent (Figure S2F). Because LC radioresistance constitutes the best way to distinguish them from radiosensitive dermal cDCs (Merad et al., 2002), we generated CD45.1 LG-DTR BMs into CD45.2 WT B6 chimeras. In this model, DT administration only depleted cDC1s and not LCs (Figure S2G), and consistent with our previous observation, absence of cDC1s dampened P. acnes-induced inflammation measured by a decrease in the ear inflammation and cell infiltration similar to that in the LG-DTR mice (Figures S2H and S2I). Finally, we asked about any potential role of cDC2s using the Itgax cre Irf4 flfl model, which lacks functional cDC2s in the skin (Schlitzer et al., 2013). The absence of cDC2s had no effect on P. acnes-induced inflammation measured by ear swelling and cell infiltration (Figure S2J). Altogether, these data identify a crucial role played by cDC1s in the induction of the inflammatory immune responses to P. acnes, in particular in the regulation of neutrophil recruitment. Depletion of cDC1s Reduces Neutrophil Expression of Recruitment-Related Genes To begin to understand how the absence of cDC1s leads to lower neutrophil numbers during P. acnes infection, we compared the gene expression profiles of neutrophils from the skin of non-depleted LG-DTR mice (control mice) and LG-DTR mice 24 h after DT injection (depleted mice). Between neutrophils from control and cDC1-depleted mice at 12 h, 2 days, and 4 days after infection, we identified 297, 149, and 227 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively (Figure 2 A and Table S2). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed that most of the Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes associated with the downregulated DEGs were related to immune function of neutrophils, specifically to neutrophil recruitment to the site of inflammation: these included cellular movement, recruitment, infiltration, quantity, chemotaxis, priming, mobilization, migration, and attraction of neutrophils (Figure 2B). We further validated these results by using the quantitative NanoString platform and focusing on the expression of 179 inflammatory genes (Figure S3A). We identified 28 neutrophil recruitment- and migration-associated genes whose expression significantly differed in the presence or absence of cDC1s during P. acnes infection, including Cdc42 (Kumar et al., 2012), Cxcl3 (Stock et al., 2014), Ccr1 (Reichel et al., 2006), Il1b, and Tnf. Other DEGs related to neutrophil activation and response to bacterial products were Oas1a, Irf5, and Irf7 (Ericson et al., 2014). Seven of these DEGs (Cxcl10, Il1a, Il23a, Csf3, Stat1, Irf1, and Ifit2) from the inflammatory gene panel overlapped those highlighted by the bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis above. Similarly, IPA showed that most of the GO biological processes associated with the DEGs were enriched with genes related to neutrophil immune function and specifically to their recruitment to inflamed sites (Figure S3B). We also observed the downregulation of colony-stimulating factor 1 (Csf1) gene in absence of cDC1s (Figure S3C). Downregulation of neutrophil CSF-1 expression most likely explains the decreased monocyte recruitment observed in the absence of cDC1s given that neutrophil-derived CSF-1 controls monocyte influx into inflamed tissue (Wang et al., 2016). We next used intravital multiphoton microscopy to ask whether these changes in neutrophil gene expression in the absence of cDC1s have functional correlates in vivo during the early stages of P. acnes infection. To enable visualization of neutrophils, we employed albino mice expressing both Lysozyme M-GFP and Langerin-DTR (Lysozyme M-GFP/Langerin-DTR mice), in which all cells expressing Lysozyme (neutrophils) are labeled green (Li et al., 2012), and Langerin-expressing LCs and cDCs can be depleted by DT administration. In non-depleted control mice, 1 day after P. acnes injection (107 CFUs), neutrophils swarmed in a coordinated fashion by moving rapidly in the extravascular space (Video S1) and accumulating around the P. acnes injection site (Figures 2C\u20132E). This high-velocity movement remained on day 2 after P. acnes injection (Video S2 and Figure 2F). In LC- and cDC1-depleted mice, neutrophil density was markedly lower around the P. acnes infection site from day 1 after injection (Figures 2C\u20132E), and neutrophil velocity was significantly decreased to almost complete stillness by day 2 (Videos S3 and S4 and Figure 2F). Also, on day 2 there was a further decrease in the number of infiltrating neutrophils, concurrent with significantly smaller granuloma development (Figures 2C\u20132E). Neutrophil displacement was also significantly lower in cDC1-depleted mice than in non-depleted mice (Figure 2G). Interestingly, neutrophils were almost sessile at day 2 in mice depleted of cDC1s (Video S4 and Figure 2F). Similarly to the flow-cytometry experiment with lower doses of P. acnes (Figure S2D), we confirmed a lower neutrophil recruitment in depleted mice (LG-DTR mice) than in WT B6 mice by using 106 CFUs of P. acnes (Figures S3D and S3E). Video S1. Migratory Behavior of Neutrophils in the Dermis at D1 after P. acnes Injection in Control Mice, Related to Figures 2F and 2G Video S2. Migratory Behavior of Neutrophils in the Dermis at D2 after P. acnes Injection in Control Mice, Related to Figures 2F and 2G Video S3. Migratory Behavior of Neutrophils in the Dermis at D1 after P. acnes Injection in Depleted Mice, Related to Figures 2F and 2G Video S4. Migratory Behavior of Neutrophils in the Dermis at D2 after P. acnes Injection in Depleted Mice, Related to Figures 2F and 2G In summary, in the absence of LCs and dermal cDC1s, patterns of neutrophil gene expression are significantly altered, resulting in decreased expression of migration- and recruitment-associated genes, which is mirrored at the functional level by less neutrophil recruitment to the P. acnes injection site and decreased motility of those neutrophils that are recruited. These data support the crucial role of cDC1s in regulating the sustained and dynamic recruitment of neutrophils from the blood to the skin. cDC1s Control Essential Neutrophil Activation and Survival Alongside reduced expression of migration- and recruitment-associated genes in neutrophils from mice depleted of dermal cDC1s, transcripts encoding key components of anti-microbial pathways were also significantly less abundant in neutrophils in the absence of cDC1s (Figure 2A). One such molecule is receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), which, together with RIPK3 and mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL), is necessary for the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (Desai et al., 2016); anti-microbial webs of DNA coated with cytotoxic histones and microbicidal proteases (Brinkmann et al., 2013). Therefore, we asked whether depleting cDC1s compromises the ability of neutrophils to generate NETs. A prerequisite for NETosis is the modification of arginine residues to citrulline on histones by a specific enzyme (peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 [PAD4]), which leads to massive chromatin de-condensation (Wang et al., 2009). Quantification of the ratio of histone H3 citrullinated (H3Cit) to normal histone H3 (H3) by western blot revealed a significant increase in the H3Cit/H3 ratio in un-depleted versus depleted mice. These data suggested that in the absence of cDC1s, NETosis activity was compromised (Figure 2H). Neutrophils are short-lived cells in the steady state, but during inflammation their lifespan increases through activation-induced inhibition of apoptosis (Elbim et al., 2009). Thus, the reduced expression of activation-related genes in neutrophils from LC- and cDC1-depleted mice might also increase neutrophil apoptosis. We measured expression of the early apoptotic marker Annexin-V and the incorporation level of the DNA dye DAPI (indicating dead cells) across the neutrophil populations from the ear skin of mice injected with P. acnes. From day 1 after infection, the relative numbers of dying (Annexin-V+DAPI\u2212) and dead neutrophils (Annexin-V+DAPI+ and Annexin-V\u2212DAPI+) were significantly higher in the absence of the LCs and cDC1s than in non-depleted control mice (26.37% \u00b1 5.2% versus 15.28% \u00b1 1.81%; p = 0.0087) (Figure S3F). In agreement with these observations, we observed an upregulation of the expression of bim (BCL2L11), a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family (Aguil\u00f3 et al., 2014), in the absence of cDC1s (Table S2). Altogether, these data indicate that dermal cDC1s promote neutrophil survival and, by consequence, skin inflammation associated with neutrophil accumulation. Single-Cell mRNA Sequencing Reveals Two Subsets of cDC1s in P. acnes-Inflamed Dermis Multi-dimensional analyses are now revealing previously unappreciated levels of functional heterogeneity within immune cell subsets (See et al., 2017); therefore, we applied single-cell mRNA sequencing to ask, at the single-cell level, how dermal cDC1s might be mediating neutrophil recruitment and function. We first profiled the transcriptomic signature of 67 single dermal cDC1s isolated from the ears of WT B6 mice, 16 h after P. acnes injection (Figures 3 A and S4A\u2013S4C), and then used these data to group cells sharing common patterns of gene expression. Using the 67 single cell transcriptomes, we performed principal-component analysis (PCA) (Figure S4D), followed by hierarchical clustering of the 400 most variably expressed genes via Fluidigm SINGuLAR and sorting points into neighborhoods (SPIN) methods (Szulwach et al., 2015; Tsafrir et al., 2005). The SINGuLAR approach revealed two distinct cell clusters within the 67-cell cDC1 population: a minor cluster of 8 cells (subset 1, red) and a major cluster of 59 cells (subset 2, green) (Figure S4E). The same clusters, composed of the same individual cells, were identified by the SPIN analysis (Figure S4F). Supervised hierarchical clustering via the SINGuLAR method identified 1,796 DEGs between the two dermal cDC1 clusters (Figure 3B and Table S3), of which 240 were less highly expressed and 1,556 were more highly expressed in subset 1 versus subset 2 (p value \u2264 0.05). IPA revealed that most of the DEGs expressed more abundantly in the minor subset 1 were related to DC immune function after capture of antigen, activation, phagocytosis, priming, and migration pathways (Figure 3C); DC migration to the lymph node (Figure 3D); maturation and activation during immune response (Figure 3E); and also antigen priming and presentation by MHC-I (Figure 3F). Interestingly, some genes related to immune cell recruitment were also expressed more highly in the minor subset 1: genes related to monocyte and/or macrophage recruitment, including Ccl2, Cxcl14, and Csf1 (Lu et al., 2016; Qian et al., 2011), or linked to T cell activation, such as Ccl20 and Ccl27a (Hirota et al., 2007; Woodland and Kohlmeier, 2009) (Figure S4G). Among the genes less highly expressed in subset 1, we found those involved in the MHCII presentation pathway (Figure 3G). Altogether, this analysis suggests that the minor subset of cDC1s represents an activated DC population in P. acnes-injected skin. We then asked whether these cDC1 clusters could be retrospectively identified in skin on the basis of differences in expression of membrane proteins encoded by DEGs highlighted in the single-cell transcriptome dataset. We confirmed the significant difference of transcript abundance for the surface markers EpCAM, CD59, and Ly-6D in the two cDC1 subsets (Figure 3H). Next, we measured by flow cytometry the frequency and intensity of cell-surface protein-level expression of these markers by dermal cDC1s both inside and outside the granulomatous area of P. acnes- or PBS-injected skin. This confirmed the presence of a minor population of cDC1s expressing high levels of CD59, EpCAM, and Ly-6D (Figure 3I). In addition, this minor cDC1 population was proportionally enriched inside the granuloma (Figures S4H and S4I), suggesting a link between the presence of the bacteria and the increased expression of these markers by cDC1s. Lastly, we confirmed that these markers were specific to cDC1s and not shared by cDC2s (Figure 3J). Thus, an activated dermal cDC1 subset can be distinguished within the cDC1 population at both the transcriptional and surface marker levels. Activated Dermal cDC1s Express Neutrophil Chemo-attractant VEGF-\u03b1 in the Presence of P. acnes We then screened the single-cell cDC1 gene expression dataset for secreted molecules that could play a role in neutrophil recruitment and activation. Multiple potential neutrophil-modulatory candidates, such as Cxcl1, Il22, Il23a, Il19, Il7, Il1a, and Vegfa, were significantly more expressed in the activated minor cDC1 subset than in the rest of the population (Figure 4 A). Given that VEGF-VEGFR regulates neutrophil infiltration into tissues during infection (Massena et al., 2015), we asked whether cDC1s produced this protein in response to P. acnes. It is not possible to isolate sufficient numbers of activated dermal cDC1s for intracellular flow-cytometry analysis of cytokine production, so we instead derived cDC1s from bone marrow cells (Mayer et al., 2014) and exposed them to P. acnes in vitro. Bone-marrow-derived cDC1s but not cDC2s produced increasing amounts of VEGF-\u03b1 in response to escalating densities of the bacterium and to similar levels than after Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, except the agonist of TLR7 and TLR8 (CLO75) (Figures 4B, 4C, and S5A). To understand the relevance of these pathways in our model, we tested the expression profile of VEGF receptors and other markers on neutrophils infiltrating the skin in the presence or absence of cDC1s. Using our neutrophil-specific CyTOF panel (Table S1), we uncovered marked changes in bone marrow, blood, and skin neutrophil phenotype in response to P. acnes. Over time, bone marrow neutrophils upregulated CXCR2 and CD62L expression, two markers known to regulate the neutrophil release from bone marrow to the blood circulation (Eash et al., 2010) (Figure S5B). Blood neutrophils expressed high amounts of CXCR2 associated with an upregulation of the expression of CD62L and CD49d, two markers linked to the tethering and rolling along postcapillary venules, prior to transmigration across the vascular endothelium to sites of inflammation (Figure S5C). Importantly, whereas in both control and depleted mice skin neutrophils gradually increased CD44 and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, the frequency and intensity of VEGFR1 expression was only significantly increased in controls, measured by both CyTOF and flow cytometry (Figures 4D, 4E, and S5D). These effects were specific to neutrophils in the skin of cDC1-depleted mice, as comparable levels and patterns of marker expression were observed in bone marrow (Figure S5B) and blood (Figure S5C) neutrophils in control and depleted animals. To understand the functional impact of VEGF-\u03b1 on early recruitment and regulation of VEGFR1 expression by neutrophils, we neutralized this cytokine in vivo by using a specific blocking antibody. After concomitant intradermal injection of WT B6 mice with anti-VEGF-\u03b1 antibodies and P. acnes, we measured that ear swelling and neutrophil infiltration were significantly less abundant [or prominent] in these mice than in control WT B6 mice (Figure 4F), at levels comparable to those in mice lacking cDC1s and LCs (LG-DTR 24 h after DT injection) (Figures 1F, 1G, and 4F). Accordingly, intradermal injection of recombinant VEGF-\u03b1 protein concomitant with P. acnes reinstated the inflammatory response in mice depleted of cDC1s and LCs (LG-DTR mice 24 h after DT injection) to the same extent as in WT B6 mice (Figure 4G). cDC1-Derived VEGF\u03b1 Is Necessary for the Inflammatory Response to P. acnes To directly assess whether cDC1-derived VEGF-\u03b1 specifically controls neutrophil recruitment to the site of P. acnes injection and its ensuing inflammation, we generated a mouse model wherein VEGF-\u03b1 expression was uniquely abrogated in cDC1s. To this end, we bred a cDC1-specific Cre model (Xcr1 Cre mouse model; see Experimental Model and Subject Details) with the Vegf fl/fl mouse model (Gerber et al., 1999). Importantly, after P. acnes injection in Xcr1 Cre Vegf fl/fl mice (Figure 4H), we observed a significant decrease in neutrophil infiltration and subsequent decrease in ear inflammation compared with those in control mice. We also investigated the molecular pathways regulating VEGF-\u03b1 expression in cDC1s. The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor \u03b1 (HIF-\u03b1) regulates VEGF-\u03b1 expression by in-vitro-generated DCs (Salvi et al., 2016). To deplete specifically HIF-\u03b1 in cDC1s, we used the cDC1-specific Cre model (Xcr1 Cre) (Figure 4I). The specific absence of HIF-\u03b1 expression in cDC1s led to a major decrease in neutrophil infiltration and a subsequent decrease in ear inflammation compared with those in the control mice, validating the crucial role played by the cDC1s in promoting neutrophil infiltration. Altogether, these data identify a key role for cDC1-derived VEGF-\u03b1 in neutrophil recruitment to the site of P. acnes injection in mice. We also identified HIF-\u03b1 as a necessary transcription factor for dermal cDC1 activation and their subsequent VEGF-\u03b1 secretion in vivo. cDC1s Control Neutrophil Recruitment and Ensuing Inflammatory Response to Other Bacterial Species in Mice and Humans To understand whether cDC1s can respond similarly to other bacterial species, we performed ear-infection experiments with 106 CFUs of bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) (Figure 5 A), 108 CFUs of S. aureus (Figure 5B), and 106 CFUs of E. coli (Figure 5C) and analyzed neutrophil infiltration at day 1 and day 2 in DT-treated LG-DTR mice compared with WT B6 mice. After BCG, S. aureus, or E. coli infection, WT ears showed a strong neutrophil infiltration and ear thickening that were both significantly decreased in the absence of cDC1s, recapitulating the observed responses with P. acnes. In addition, the minor activated cDC1 population expressing CD59, EpCAM, and Ly-6D could be observed during BCG (Figure 5A), S. aureus (Figure 5B), and E. coli (Figure 5C) infection. These data suggest that cDC1 control of neutrophil recruitment in P. acnes infection can be extended to other gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species. In addition, we assessed if cDC1-derived VEGF-\u03b1 specifically controls neutrophil recruitment to the site of infection with E. coli. After E. coli injection in Xcr1 Cre Vegf fl/fl mice (Figure 5D), we observed a significant decrease in neutrophil infiltration and subsequent decrease in ear inflammation compared with those in control mice. These data suggest that the key role for cDC1-derived VEGF-\u03b1 in neutrophil recruitment can be extended to other bacterial infections. We next investigated whether our observations in mice could be translated in the human context. The human experimental skin blister is a perfectly suited model for studying neutrophil influx, in the context of cDC1 activation, after a bacterial insult in healthy individuals. After an intradermal injection of 15 million UV-killed E. coli, an inflammatory response demonstrated by increased blood flow to the site and surrounding area of the injection site was induced (Figure 6 A). In order to isolate the cell and fluid exudate, we applied negative pressure to the skin, at either 4 or 24 h after the bacterial injection, to induce a blister and collected the inflammatory cells and fluid (Figure 6A). Neutrophils and cDC1s were found at the site of challenge at both 4 and 24 h after injection (Figure 6B). An increase in VEGFR1 expression on neutrophils from blood to blister exudate at 4 and 24 h after infection was observed (Figure 6C). We next quantified by Luminex the presence of VEGF-\u03b1 in the plasma and fluid blister. VEGF-\u03b1 was detected and increased over time in the plasma (Figure 6D). In addition, VEGF-\u03b1 was also detected in the blister fluid with a peak of concentration at 4 h after infection (Figure 6D). We next performed qPCR for human VEGF-165, which corresponds to VEGF-\u03b1, on the few cDC1s sorted from the blood and blister fluid 24 h after infection. We observed an increase in human VEGF-165 expression with a relative fold change of 2.15 \u00b1 0.33 between cDC1s from the blister fluid versus blood (Figure 6E). Altogether, these data suggest that the cDC1 to neutrophil crosstalk through the VEGF\u03b1-VEGFR1 pathway in the context of bacterial infection of murine skin can be translated to human immune response to bacterial infection. Discussion In this study, we uncovered an essential role for cDC1s in regulating neutrophil biology through the VEGF\u03b1-VEGFR1 pathway in the context of bacterial infection of murine skin and highlighted a specific role of a CD59+EpCAM+Ly-6D+ minor cDC1 subset in the regulation of tissue innate immunity that goes beyond antigen presentation and T cell priming. By depleting specific skin DC subsets during the response to P. acnes in vivo, we found that mice lacking cDC1s, either because of DT-mediated depletion (LG-DTR mice) or because of genetic ablation (Batf3 \u2212/\u2212 mice), exhibit significantly reduced inflammatory reactions to the bacterium, characterized by less ear swelling and a smaller inflammatory infiltrate, especially neutrophils. Transferring bone-marrow-derived cDC1s into cDC1-deficient skin reinstated these inflammatory responses. These observations suggest that an early crosstalk between cDC1s and neutrophils determines the extent and duration of skin inflammation in response to this cutaneous pathogen. It seems likely that similar crosstalk would occur in other skin infections, or even perhaps in other tissue or inflammatory conditions. A recent report demonstrated that during a systemic Candida albicans infection, cDC1 activation regulates neutrophilia via the secretion of the chemokine CXCL2 (Del Fresno et al., 2018). However, we did not detect any Cxcl2 expression in our single-cell cDC1 dataset, but this could be due to the limited detection rate of such technology. The authors also showed that CXCL2 expression was induced by engagement with DNGR1, an extra-cellular membrane protein described as a molecular sensor of cell death and inflammation (Sancho et al., 2009). This study and ours highlight a regulatory tissue damage control mechanism lead by cDC1s, which appear to act as a checkpoint for neutrophil infiltration that drives immunopathology in infected and/or injured tissues. Future studies defining the initiating stimuli and the molecular mechanism underlying such cDC1 to neutrophil crosstalk will enable a better understanding of the immune signaling networks involved. It is known that beyond their crucial function as professional antigen presenting cells, DC subsets have additional early non-redundant innate properties that include activation of natural killer (NK) cells and innate lymphoid cell (ILC) subsets by secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In particular, it is known that cDC1s are necessary for the induction of type I responses to many pathogens (Brise\u00f1o et al., 2014), and here we extended their functional repertoire to include sustaining recruitment of neutrophils into the skin after the initial influx in response to pathogenic insult. Importantly, early recruitment of neutrophils was unaffected by the absence of cDC1s, in agreement with the finding that initial neutrophil recruitment upon insult occurs predominantly as an immediate process (Ng et al., 2011). However, cDC1s appeared to regulate the sustained recruitment and activation of neutrophils, acting as a cellular innate checkpoint making a decision on the amplification of the early recruitment of neutrophils. Indeed, of particular interest was the upregulation of expression of Vegfa in the activated subset of cDC1s in vivo and the production of VEGF-\u03b1 by cDC1s in vitro in response to P. acnes. The production of VEGF-\u03b1 proved to be key to the inflammatory response given that treatment of mice with a VEGF-\u03b1-blocking antibody significantly reduced the early inflammation induced by P. acnes and diminished the level of neutrophil influx after injection of the bacteria. The specific ablation of the VEGF-\u03b1 expression from the cDC1s, through generation of the Xcr1 Cre Vegf fl/fl mouse model, abrogated the inflammatory response to P. acnes and resulted in significantly less neutrophil infiltration and less ear inflammation than in the control mice. This strategy validated the crucial role for cDC1-derived VEGF-\u03b1 in neutrophil recruitment to the site of P. acnes injection in mice. In addition, the cDC1-specific absence of HIF-\u03b1, a transcription factor shown to regulate VEGF-\u03b1 expression from DCs (Salvi et al., 2016), affected the inflammatory response to P. acnes, including significantly less immune cell infiltration, as well as prevented the emergence of the activated cDC1 subset. Altogether, these observations suggested that VEGF-\u03b1 secreted by the activated cDC1s played a crucial role in the control of the immune response to P. acnes, specifically in the regulation of neutrophil infiltration and response. The identification of HIF-\u03b1 as a necessary transcription factor for dermal cDC1 activation and their subsequent VEGF-\u03b1 secretion in vivo opens the possibility to design new intervention strategies to control the early phases of P. acnes or other bacterial inflammation. In addition to neutrophil recruitment, cDC1s exerted wide effects on neutrophil biology during P. acnes infection. In the absence of cDC1s, neutrophils exhibited significant decreases in expression of genes related to the immune function of neutrophils, inter-neutrophil communication, and neutrophil recruitment to the site of inflammation. Accordingly, using intravital multiphoton imaging, we observed not only diminished recruitment of neutrophils in mice lacking dermal cDC1s but also profound alterations in the behavior of those neutrophils that were recruited: these cells moved more slowly and exhibited altered patterns of migration. Neutrophil survival and enzymatic activity related to the host defense were impeded in the absence of cDC1s in the skin; neutrophil phenotype was also affected, including decreased expression of VEGFR1, which facilitates neutrophil infiltration into inflamed tissues (Massena et al., 2015). These data highlight the presence of a VEGF-\u03b1-VEGFR1 axis operating between cDC1s and neutrophils in the skin as a regulatory feedback loop. Interestingly, the extent and magnitude of the effects of dermal cDC1s upon neutrophil biology were remarkable given the relative scarcity of the activated cDC1 subset (few cells per infected ear) compared with the abundance of neutrophils. This leads us to speculate that these few activated cDC1s provide potent innate activation stimuli, including VEGF-\u03b1 locally that is amplified, resulting in a widespread effect in the infected tissue, similar to what was shown for isoform nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in tissues infected with Leishmania (Olekhnovitch and Bousso, 2015). To understand whether a similar crosstalk could exist upon other types of bacterial infections, we next investigated the effect of cDC1 depletion on the response to species such as BCG, S. aureus, and E. coli. The specific absence of cDC1s during the immune response to other bacterial species impacted significantly neutrophil infiltration and ear thickening, recapitulating the observed responses with P. acnes. In addition, the minor activated cDC1 population expressing CD59, EpCAM, and Ly-6D could be observed during the immune response to these bacterial species. We also tested whether a similar crosstalk could be observed in a human model of E. coli infection. After the formation of a blister induced by the subcutaneous injection of UV-killed E. coli, the blister\u2019s neutrophils expressed more VEGFR1 than did blood neutrophils, and over time this was associated with higher VEGF-\u03b1 expression by the blister\u2019s cDC1s than by blood cDC1s. Altogether, this suggests a conserved mechanism across species by which cDC1s regulate neutrophil recruitment and activation thru VEGF-\u03b1 secretion. Collectively, we provided evidence that in the regulation of tissue innate immunity, cDC1s play a crucial role that goes beyond classical antigen presentation and T cell priming and represents a cellular checkpoint that regulates the sustained recruitment and activation of neutrophils via a VEGF-\u03b1-VEGFR1 axis. Further work should investigate the similarities in term of cell composition, pathways activated, and cDC1 transcriptomic profiles during the immune response to skin bacterial infection in humans. Such murine-human-parallel comparative study at both the transcriptomic and cellular levels will aid understanding of human immune response to bacterial infection and, more importantly, might facilitate the development of new molecular targets for the treatment of acne vulgaris and other bacterial infections.

Experimental Model and Subject Details Volunteers All subjects were healthy volunteers (males 18-35 years old). All volunteers gave written informed consent, and all studies were conducted according to the principles of the declaration of Helsinki after approval by the University College London Institutional Ethics Committee (Project ID: 10527/001). Mice C57BL/6 (C45.2+) mice were bred and maintained under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions in the Biological Resource Centre (BRC) of A\u2217STAR, Singapore. Both males and females were used for experiments, but animals were sex- and age-matched in each experiment as much as possible. Congenic C57BL/6 (C45.1+) (B6.SJL-Ptprc a -Pepc b/BoyJ), HIF1\u03b1 fl/fl (B6.129-Hif1 atm3Rsjo /J), Irf4 fl/fl (B6.129S1-Irf4 tm1Rdf /J), Itgax Cre (B6.Cg-Tg(Itgax-cre)1-1Reiz/J) were from Jackson Laboratory (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, USA). Batf3 \u2212/\u2212 (B6.129S(C)-Batf3 tm1Kmm/J) and ZBTB46 GFP (B6.129S6(C)-Zbtb46 tm1.1Kmm/J) bone marrow were provided by K. Murphy. Vegf\u03b1 fl/fl (Vegfatm2Gne) mice were provided by M. Guilliams. Langerin-DTR (B6.129S2-Cd207 tm3(DTR/GFP)Mal/J) and Xcr1 cre (Xcr1-IRES-iCre-2A-mTFP1 gene-targeted mice) were provided by B. Malissen. For the generation of Xcr1 cre mice, a synthetic targeting construct was designed to introduce an IRES-iCre-GSG-2A-mTFP1 cassette in the 3\u2032 untranslated region of the Xcr1 gene, 29 bp downstream of the stop codon. IRES corresponds to an internal ribosomal entry site, iCre to the sequence coding for a codon-improved Cre recombinase, 2A to the sequence coding for a self-cleaving 2A peptide, and mTFP1, for a sequence coding for a monomeric, bright, and photostable version of Clavularia cyan fluorescent protein. The IRES-iCRE-GSG-2A-TEAL cassette was abutted to a frt-flanked cassette that contains a neomycin-kanamycin resistance (neor) gene that can be expressed under the control of a prokaryotic (gb2) or eukaryotic (Pgk1) promoter. The final targeting construct also contained a cassette coding for the diphtheria toxin fragment A expression cassette. JM8.F6 C57BL/6N ES cells were electroporated with the targeting vector that was linearized with Fse1. After selection in G418, ES cell clones were screened for proper homologous recombination by PCR and Southern blot. A neomycin-specific probe was used to ensure that adventitious non-homologous recombination events had not occurred in the selected ES clones. Properly recombined ES cells were injected into FVB blastocysts. Following germline transmission, excision of the frt-neor-frt cassette was achieved through genetic cross with transgenic mice expressing the FLP recombinase under the control of the actin promoter. Xcr1-iCre-GSG-2A-mTFP1 (also known as B6-Xcr1tm2Ciphe and called XCR1-CRE mice here) were crossed to LSL-RFP mice that express in the ROSA26 locus a red fluorescent protein (RFP) flanked by a loxP-bracketed transcriptional stopper. In LSL-RFP mice, the loxP-flanked cassette prevents RFP expression in the absence of Cre activity. Analysis of the myeloid cells found in the skin of Xcr1 cre x LSL-RFP mice showed appropriate recombinase expression in that the sole cDC1 were RFP+ as observed in a recently published model in which the entire sequence corresponding to the mouse Xcr1 gene was replaced with a gene encoding the Cre recombinase. Vegf\u03b1 fl/fl mice, HIF1\u03b1 fl/fl mice and Irf4 fl/fl mice were crossed with Xcr1 cre+ and Itgax Cre+ mice to give rise to congenic Xcr1 cre+ Vegf\u03b1 fl/fl mice, Xcr1 cre+ HIF1\u03b1 fl/fl mice and Itgax Cre+ Irf4 fl/fl mice respectively. All mice were bred and maintained in the Singapore Immunology Network animal facility before use at 7\u201312 weeks of age. For the generation of BM chimeras, female B6 CD45.1 mice at 6-8 weeks of age were lethally irradiated with two doses of 600 rads, 5 hr apart, and then injected i.v. with 1 \u00d7 106 cells from femurs and tibias of Batf3 \u2212/\u2212 , ZBTB46 GFP, Langerin-DTR mice. All experiments and procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Biological Resource Center (Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore) in accordance with the guidelines of the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) and the National Advisory Committee for Laboratory Animal Research (NACLAR) of Singapore. Method Details Bacterial culture and intradermal injection P. acnes strain (ATCC\u00ae 6919) was obtained from American Type Culture Collections and grown in a BBL schaedler broth (Becton Dickinson) in an anaerobic chamber at 37\u00b0C for 5\u20136 days. A spectrophotometer reading OD525 (optical density at 525 nm) was used to identify the bacterial log growth phase. Live P. acnes was intradermally injected (106, 107 or 108 CFUs in 20\u03bcl of PBS and 106 or 107 CFUs in 1\u03bcl of PBS for Intravital multiphoton imaging) into the left ear of mice; while the right ear was injected with an equal volume of PBS. Mycobacterium bovis BCG was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with albumin-dextrose-catalase (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.05% Tween 80 (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37\u00b0C for 5 to 7 days to an OD600 of 0.4 to 0.5. After this, mycobacterial cells were pelleted, resuspended in fresh 7H9 broth with 20% glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich), and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. One vial of the stock was thawed to enumerate CFU per milliliter. On the day of infection, the cells were thawed, washed, and sonicated before use. BCG was intradermally injected (106 CFUs in 20\u03bcl of PBS) into the left ear of mice; while the right ear was injected with an equal volume of PBS. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) was obtained from ATCC (ATCC\u00ae 6538 and ATCC\u00ae 25922 respectively) and grown in Luria broth medium (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37\u00b0C for 16 hours. A spectrophotometer reading OD600 was used to identify the bacterial log growth phase. Live S. aureus (108 CFUs in 20\u03bcl of PBS) or E. coli (106 CFUs in 20\u03bcl of PBS) were intradermally injected into the left ear of mice; while the right ear was injected with an equal volume of PBS. For infection in LG-DTR mice, Diphtheria Toxin (Sigma-Aldrich) was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.). Recombinant mouse VEGF 164 protein (300 ng, R&D system) or anti-vegf\u03b1 (2ug, Abcam) have been intradermally injected concomitantly with P. acnes. Ear thickness was measured using an electronic caliper (Mitutoyo). Histological analysis Frozen skin samples embedded in OCT compound (Science Services) were sliced into 5-\u03bcm-thick sections and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Sigma-Aldrich) before staining with Mayer\u2019s hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or Picro Sirius red Stain Kit (Abcam). Preparation of ear cell suspensions Mouse skin cells were isolated as described previously (Ginhoux et al., 2007). Briefly, mouse ears were split into dorsal and ventral halves and floated in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 1 mg/mL dispase (Sigma-Aldrich) for 60 min at 37\u00b0C to allow separation of epidermal and dermal sheets. The separated sheets were then cut into small pieces and incubated in RPMI containing 10% serum, Collagenase IV (0.2mg / ml, Sigma-Aldrich) and DNase I (20000U / ml, Roche) for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C. Cells were then passed through 19 G needle and filtered through a 100 \u03bcM cell strainer (BD Falcon) to obtain a homogeneous cell suspension. Flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting Multi-parameter analyses and sorting of labeled cell suspensions were performed on a LSR II and FACSAria II (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, USA) respectively. Data were analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc. Ashland, USA). Fluorochrome- or biotin- conjugated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the following molecules used: For mouse study: antibodies: IA/IE (M5/114.15.2), Ly-6G (1A8), CD64 (X54-5/7.1), EpCAM (G8.8), CD59 (mCD59.3), Ly-6D (49-H4), CD11c (N418), CD45.1 (A20), FC\u03b5RI (MAR-1) (Biolegend); VEGF\u03b1 (EP1176Y) (Abcam); CD45 (30F11), CD45.2 (104), Ly-6C (HK1.4), CD24 (M1/69), BST2 (eBio927), CD11b (M1/70) (eBioscience), and VEGFR1 (BAF471) (R&D Systems). The streptavidin\u2013CF594 conjugate (562284) was from BD Biosciences. Annexin-V staining was performed using the Annexin kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For human study: antibodies (from Biolegend unless otherwise stated): CD1c (L161), CD3 (HIT3a), CD11c (B-ly6) BD Biosciences, CD14 (M5E2), CD16 (3G8), CD19 (HIB19), CD20 (2H7), CD56 (MEM-188), CD66b (G10F5), CD141 (BDC8-3), HLA-DR (G46-6) BD Biosciences, VEGFR1 (# 49560) R&D Systems and CLEC9a (8F9) Miltenyi Biotec. Mass Cytometry by Time Of Flight (CyTOF) To enable detailed characterization of the granulocytic and myeloid populations within the inflammatory infiltrate, cell suspensions from mouse ears were first depleted of T and B cells using antibodies against CD90 and CD19, respectively. The remaining cells were placed in a U-bottom 96-well plate (BD Falcon, cat. no. 3077), washed once with 200 \u03bcL flow cytometry buffer (4% FBS, 2 mM EDTA, 0.05% Azide in 1 \u00d7 PBS) and then stained with 100 \u03bcL of 200 \u03bcM cisplatin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min on ice to exclude dead cells. Cells were washed twice with flow cytometry buffer and incubated with 50 \u03bcL heavy-metal isotope\u2013labeled secondary mAb cocktail for 30 min on ice. Purified antibodies were obtained from Beckton Dickinson, BioLegend, eBioscience, BioXcell, R&D Biosystems, Abcam and AbD Serotec using clones listed in Table S1. For some markers, fluorophore- (phycoerythrin or allophycocyanin) or biotin-conjugated antibodies were used as primary antibodies followed by secondary staining with anti-fluorophore metal-conjugated antibodies (anti-APC, (Clone APC003, BioLegend cat. no. 408002, 5 \u03bcg/mL), anti-PE, (Clone PE001, BioLegend cat. no. 408102, 5 \u03bcg/mL)) or metal-conjugated streptavidin. Cells were washed twice with flow cytometry buffer then once with PBS before fixing with 200 \u03bcL 2% PFA (Electron Microscopy Sciences, cat. no. 15710) in PBS overnight. After fixation, cells were pelleted and resuspended in 200 \u03bcL 1 \u00d7 perm buffer (BioLegend, cat. no. 421002). Cells were washed once with perm buffer and then PBS before barcoding. In order to reduce technical variation, we used mass-tag barcoding which permits acquisition of data from all cell suspensions from all the time points and tissues during a single analysis. A unique combination of the following barcodes was chosen to stain each sample for 30 min on ice: BABE-Pd-102, DM-Rh-103, BABE-Pd-104, BABE-Pd-105, BABE-Pd-106, BABE-Pd-108, BABE-Pd-110 and BABE-Pd-113. Cells were next washed with permeabilization buffer, incubated with CyFACS for 5 min on ice, washed once more with CyFACS, and labeled at room temperature with 250 nM iridium interchalater (DVS Sciences) diluted in PBS with 2% PFA. After 20 min, cells were washed twice with CyFACS and twice in distilled water before diluting to 0.5 \u00d7 106 cells/mL in water. Cell data were acquired and analyzed using a CyTOF Mass cytometer. The data were exported in a traditional flow cytometry file (.fcs) format and cells for each barcode were deconvoluted using Boolean gating using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc, Ashland, USA). tSNE and One-SENSE analyses were performed as recently described (Cheng et al., 2016; Guilliams et al., 2016). Western blotting After isolation of skin-infiltrating neutrophils by cell sorting, cells were snap frozen and homogenized in Histone extraction buffer (Abcam) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktails (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The protein content of the supernatant was determined by bicinchoninic acid protein assay; an equal amount of protein per sample was then resolved on gradient gels (4%\u201312% Bis-Tris Plus gels, Life Technologies) and transferred onto PVDF membranes. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (rabbit polyclonal anti-H3Cit, 1:1,000, Abcam, rabbit polyclonal anti-H3, 1:1,000, Abcam, mouse monoclonal anti-Actin, 1:5,000, Abcam) at 4\u00b0C overnight, and subsequently with appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Specific staining was visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (GE Healthcare). Equal loading was confirmed by probing for Actin or Histone. Band intensity was measured using Image Lab software. SmartSeqV2 methods for bulk RNaseq and analysis Total RNA was extracted using Arcturus PicoPure RNA Isolation kit according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. All mouse RNAs were analyzed on Agilent Bioanalyser for quality assessment with median RNA Integrity Number of 7.92. cDNA libraries were prepared using 2ng of total RNA and 1ul of a 1:50,000 dilution of ERCC RNA Spike in Controls (Ambion) using SMARTSeq v2 protocol (Picelli et al., 2014) except for the following modifications: 1. Use of 20\u03bcM TSO, 2. Use of 250pg of cDNA with 1/5 reaction of Illumina Nextera XT kit. The length distribution of the cDNA libraries was monitored using DNA High Sensitivity Reagent Kit on the Perkin Elmer Labchip. All samples were subjected to an indexed PE sequencing run of 2 \u00d7 51 cycles on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 (17 samples/lane). The paired-end reads in the format of FASTQ files were mapped to mouse mm10 reference genome using STAR alignment tool. The number of reads mapped to each gene was counted using feature Counts (part of Subread package) and GENCODE gene annotation version M7. Differential gene expression analysis was performed between the non-depleted LG-DTR mice (control mice) and LG-DTR mice 24 hours post-DT-injection (depleted mice) samples collected on 3 different infection time points, i.e., 12 hours, 2 days, and 4 days, using edgeR with wild-type samples as the reference. Significantly differentially expressed genes were selected using a False Discovery Rate (FDR) threshold of less than 5%. Log2 RPKM values were computed using edgeR in R version 3.3.2 and used for heatmap plotting. Functional analysis was performed using GeneGo\u2019s MetaCore (https://portal.genego.com/). Single-cell capture and library preparation for RNA sequencing Skin cDC1s were isolated after P. acnes infection by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and were diluted to a final concentration of 300 cells per \u03bcl. Cells were loaded onto C1 integrated fluidic circuits (IFC) (5- to 10-\u03bcm chip) for capture, cell lysis, reverse transcription with oligo (dT) primers, and amplification of cDNA on a C1 Single-cell Auto Prep System according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Fluidigm). Each individual capture well has been inspected under microscope to confirm the presence of single cell. Empty well or well containing more than one cell were discarded for quality check. DNA libraries were prepared using the Illumina Nextera XT DNA library Prep Kit. Pooled libraries were run on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer using a single-end 50 bp run with an average of 2 million reads/cell. Reads were mapped against the mm10 reference genome with the Bowtie alignment program. The estimated expression values, in transcripts per million (TPM), for each gene annotated with gencode gene annotation version M4 was calculated using the RSEM program. Genes with a TPM value of 0 in all cells were discarded. TPM values less than 1 were considered background, and log2 TPM was set to 0 as a conservative background cut-off. Positive TPM values then underwent log2 transformation. There were no outlier cells identified with the Singular Analysis Toolset with default parameters. Using the Singular Analysis Toolset, we selected a subset of 8238 genes whose log2 TPM values were greater than 1 at both sample-average level and across all the cells, for all downstream analyses. The PCA function, using genes expressed in more than two cells with a non-zero variance, highlighted and ranked the genes with the most variability in expression across all the cells (Figure S4D); together with the hierarchical clustering function in the Singular Toolset (Figure S4E) this identified two subsets comprising 8 and 59 cells respectively. The ANOVA function in the Singular Toolset identified genes that were significantly differentially expressed in these two cell subsets: 1796 genes were identified, with P values of < 0.05. Among these genes, 1556 were upregulated and 240 were downregulated in the cell subset comprising of 8 cells, compared to the larger 59-cell subset. Multiple-testing correction was done by the Benjamini-Hochberg method. The sorting points into neighborhoods (SPIN) algorithm was applied to the top 100 genes with highest loadings associated with the first principal component of PCA and independently identified the two cell subsets comprising the same individual cells (Figure S4F). Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using the IPA software on the 1556 genes expressed more abundantly in the minor subset, with P values < 0.05 considered significant. Except for the MATLAB implementation of SPIN, or where otherwise noted, all analyses were performed with software of the R project for statistical computing, version 3.3.0 (Bioconductor). Bone-marrow-derived cDC culture Bone marrow was flushed from the femur and tibia from C57BL/6 mice and was used without any digestion. BM cells were incubated in 10 mL of RPMI 1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Biochrom, Cambridge, UK), penicillin/streptomycin, and 50 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol with FLT3L (200 ng/mL) combined with GM-CSF (5 ng/mL) for 7 days. Cells were then replated with the same combination of cytokines, and collected at day 15. 50,000 cDC1s were incubated with either TLR agonists; CL075 (1 \u03bcg/mL) (InvivoGen), CPG (3 \u03bcM) (InvivoGen), PI:C (25 \u03bcg/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich), PGN (10 \u03bcg/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich), LPS (0.1mg/mL) + CD40L (1 \u03bcg/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich) or with 105, 106 and 107 CFUs of P. acnes. 10 \u03bcg/mL Brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich) solution was added for 4 hours. Intracellular cytokine production was determined by flow cytometry. Gene expression analysis using NanoString nCounter system A total of 179 immunology-related mouse genes and six internal reference genes were implemented in the digital transcript counting (nCounter GX Mouse Inflammation Kit NanoString, Seattle, WA). 15,000-cell lysate was assayed on a nCounter Digital Analyzer (NanoString) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Data were normalized by scaling with the geometric mean of the built-in control gene probes for each sample. Then, a log transformation (base 2) was performed. The heatmaps showing levels of gene expression for differentially-expressed genes between neutrophils infiltrating the skin in the absence or presence of cDC1s were plotted and analyzed using the GENE-E software, version 3.0.230 (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA). Intravital multiphoton imaging We used Lysozyme M-GFP/ Langerin-DTR albino mice for all intravital imaging experiments, wherein all the cells expressing lysozyme (neutrophils) are labeled green (Li et al., 2012; Scheiermann et al., 2015). Imaging of the ear was performed as previously described (Li et al 2012). In brief, mice were anaesthetized with a cocktail of ketamine and xylazine (10 \u03bcl per gr of body weight) and then placed onto a heat pad to maintain body temperature at 37\u00b0C throughout the imaging procedure. Depilatory cream was applied for 2 min to remove hair on the upper two-thirds of the dorsal side of the mouse ear. The ear was then mounted on a custom-made ear skin stage for intravital multiphoton imaging. Data correction and analysis were conducted using Imaris software (Bitplane, South Windsor, CT). Multiphoton mosaic imaging was performed to capture the entire volume of the granuloma and its surrounding interstitium. The granuloma was quantified on Imaris using the surfacing tool, with a voxel size of 1um. The percentage of granuloma was calculated (total volume of granuloma/total imaged volume \u2217100; where total imaged volume was normalized across experiments). Human blister induction UV-killed E. coli (Strain: NCTC 10418, Source: Public Health England, UK) were prepared as described previously (Motwani et al., 2016). The forearm was disinfected and 15 \u00d7 106 UV-killed E. coli in 100 \u03bcl sterile saline was administered intradermally into the forearm. The site of inflammation was monitored at baseline, 4h and 24h following i.d injection by Laser Doppler Imager (Moor LDI-HIR, Moor Instruments Ltd, Axminster, Devon, UK) to examine blood flow at the site of inflammation. Inflammatory exudate was isolated by the induction of a suction blister as described previously (Vukmanovic-Stejic et al., 2008). A blister was formed by placing an aluminum plate with a 10mm aperture and a nylon cup connected to a negative pressure pump over the inflammatory site (NP-4, Electronic diversities Ltd., MD, USA). To this end negative pressure was applied gradually from 2 to a maximum of 9 inches of Hg. Following formation of the blister, pressure was returned gradually to baseline. The exudate was then aspirated and the cellular component prepared for FACS analysis and the acellular component stored for downstream cytokine analysis. Blisters were raised at 4 and 24 hours. Millipore Luminex bead-based multiplex assays Samples (plasma or blister fluid) or standards were incubated with fluorescent-coded magnetic beads pre-coated with VEGF\u03b1-specific capture antibodies. After an overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C with shaking, plates were washed twice with wash buffer. Biotinylated detection antibodies specific to the cytokine of interest were incubated with the complex for 1 h and subsequently Streptavidin-PE was added and the complex incubated for another 30 min. Plates were washed twice again, and beads were re-suspended with sheath fluid before a minimum of 50 beads per cytokine were analyzed on a Luminex FLEXMAP 3D (Merck Millipore). Data acquisition used xPONENT 4.0 (Luminex) acquisition software, with data analyzed in Bio-Plex Manager 6.1.1 (Bio-Rad). Cytokine concentrations were calculated from the standard curve using a 5PL (5-parameter logistic) curve fit. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR Real-time RT-PCR was done using A LightCycler 480 and LightCycler SYBR Green I Master mix were used according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) for quantitative PCR. PCR amplification was carried out in a 20 \u03bcL reaction volume containing 200 ng of cDNA, 1.8 \u03bcM each of forward and reverse primers, and 10 \u03bcL Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The PCR reactions were initiated with denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min; followed by 40 amplification cycles at 95\u00b0C for 10 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. Samples were run in duplicate and CT was calculated by analysis software SDS 2.2.1 (Applied Biosystems). Analysis of gene expression changes were calculated using the 2-\u0394\u0394CT method. The normalized expression ratio (fold induction) was calculated by 2-\u0394\u0394CT = fold induction. Statistical analyses were performed using the CT \u00b1 SD values. The primer sequences used for real-time RT-PCR for Human VEGF165 F: 5\u2032-ATCTTCAAGCCATCCTGTGTGC-3\u2032, R: 5\u2032-CAAGGCCCACAGGGATTTTC-3\u2032, Human GAPDH: F: 5\u2032-CAT GAG AAG TAT GAC AAC AGC CT-3\u2032, R: 5\u2032-AGT CCT TCC ACG ATA CCA AAG T-3\u2032. Quantification and Statistical Analysis Mann-Whitney test (with a 95% confidence) was performed by using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, USA). All p values are two-tailed. \u2217p < 0.05; \u2217\u2217p < 0.01; and \u2217\u2217\u2217p < 0.001.

Here, we examined the roles of dermal cDC1s and cDC2s during bacterial infection, notably Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes). cDC1s, but not cDC2s, regulated the magnitude of the immune response to P. acnes in the murine dermis by controlling neutrophil recruitment to the inflamed site and survival and function therein. Single-cell mRNA sequencing revealed that this regulation relied on secretion of the cytokine vascular endothelial growth factor \u03b1 (VEGF-\u03b1) by a minor subset of activated EpCAM+CD59+Ly-6D+ cDC1s. Neutrophil recruitment by dermal cDC1s was also observed during S. aureus, bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), or E. coli infection, as well as in a model of bacterial insult in human skin. Thus, skin cDC1s are essential regulators of the innate response in cutaneous immunity and have roles beyond classical antigen presentation.", "openArchiveArticle": "true", "prism:coverDate":
