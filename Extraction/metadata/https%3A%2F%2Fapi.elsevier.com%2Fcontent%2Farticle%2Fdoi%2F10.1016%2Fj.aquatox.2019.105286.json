In the present study, we divided 120 common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) into two groups including control group and CPF group, CPF group was exposed to 14.5\u202f\u03bcg/L CPF for 30 d. 17 miRNAs were differentially expressed in CPF group head kidney tissues according to the results of miRNAome analysis. In addition, histopathological examination and electron microscopy proved that CPF exposure could lead to damage of head kidney and obvious apoptosis characteristics. The possible target genes of miRNA were predicted using online target gene prediction websites, miRNAome sequencing, GO and KEGG enrichment. miRNAome results showed that expression of miR-731 and miR-2188-3p in CPF group was 0.48 time and 0.45 time as control group, respectively. qRT-PCR results proved the reality of miRNAome. During CPF exposure, mRNA expression of TLR pathway genes and its downstream genes involved in autophagy and apoptosis pathway including TLR1, TLR2, TLR7, TLR9, MyD88, IRAK1, IRAK4, IRF7, PI3K, AKT, mTOR, Caspase3, Caspase8 and Bax were differentially increased under CPF exposure, along with ATG13 and Bcl2 decreased at the same time. Western blot results indicated that apoptosis related protein Caspase3 and Caspase8 were differentially up-regulated in the CPF group. In summary, CPF exposure could induce apoptosis while inhibited autophagy in head kidney of common carp via the regulation of miR-2188-3p and miR-731 by targeting TLR pathway. These results provide new insights for unveiling the biological effects of CPF and miRNAs in common carp.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Chlorpyrifos"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "miR-731"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "miR-2188"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Toll-like receptor"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Carp"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Head kidney"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166445X19303947", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166445X19303947", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85071523274", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85071523274", "pubmed-id": "31479757", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071523274", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20190827", "$": "2019-08-27"}}}}}
