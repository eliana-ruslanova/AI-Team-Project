Hsp90 inhibitors induce cell death in various cancers, including CRC. However, the underlying mechanisms need to be clarified further. In this study, Caco-2 cells were treated with 0.25\u202f\u03bcM SNX-2112, an Hsp90 inhibitor, for 48\u202fh; subsequently, whole-transcriptome sequencing was performed. At the mRNA level in SNX-2112-treated Caco-2 cells, 1588 genes were upregulated, and 433 genes were downregulated. Six genes were found to be associated with necroptosis and apoptosis, and these 6 upregulated genes were validated by RT-qPCR. Hundred and six miRNAs were upregulated, and 48 miRNAs were downregulated in SNX-2112-treated Caco-2 cells. Eleven downregulated miRNAs were found to interact with the 6 upregulated genes. Moreover, 676 circRNAs were upregulated, and 291 circRNAs were downregulated in SNX-2112-treated Caco-2 cells. Among them, 126 circRNAs were found to be the target of the 11 downregulated miRNAs. The circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network of Hsp90 inhibitor-induced cell death in colorectal cancer was constructed. This regulatory network extends the underlying mechanism of Hsp90 and improves our understanding of Hsp90 inhibitors as potential targeted therapeutic agents.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Colorectal cancer"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "SNX-2112"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Cell death"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "mRNA"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "miRNA"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "circRNA"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378111919308911", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111919308911", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85075853200", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85075853200", "pubmed-id": "31715300", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85075853200", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20191109", "$": "2019-11-09"}}}}}
