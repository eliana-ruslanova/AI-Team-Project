Mesopic, dark-adapted (DA) cyan and red sensitivities were assessed by using fundus-controlled perimetry (\u201cmicroperimetry\u201d); and retinal microstructure was assessed by using spectral-domain optical-coherence-tomography (SD-OCT), fundus autofluorescence (FAF), and near-infrared-reflectance (IR) imaging. Layer thicknesses and intensities and FAF and IR intensities were extracted for each test point. The cross-validated mean absolute error (MAE) was evaluated for random forest-based predictions of retinal sensitivity with and without patient-specific training data and percentage of increased mean-squared error (%IncMSE) as measurement of feature importance.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  Retinal sensitivity was predicted with a MAE of 4.64 dB for mesopic, 4.89 dB for DA cyan, and 4.40 dB for DA red testing in the absence of patient-specific data. Partial addition of patient-specific sensitivity data to the training sets decreased the MAE to 2.89 dB, 2.86 dB, and 2.77 dB. For all 3 types of testing, the outer nuclear layer thickness constituted the most important predictive feature (35.0, 42.22, and 53.74 %IncMSE). Spatially resolved mapping of \u201cinferred sensitivity\u201d revealed regions with differential degrees of mesopic and DA cyan sensitivity loss outside of the GA lesions.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  \u201cInferred sensitivity\u201d accurately reflected retinal function in patients with GA. Mapping of \u201cinferred sensitivity\u201d could facilitate monitoring of disease progression and serve as \u201cquasi functional\u201d surrogate outcome in clinical trials, especially in consideration of retinal regions beyond areas of GA.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002939420301707", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002939420301707", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20200411", "$": "2020-04-11"}}}}}
