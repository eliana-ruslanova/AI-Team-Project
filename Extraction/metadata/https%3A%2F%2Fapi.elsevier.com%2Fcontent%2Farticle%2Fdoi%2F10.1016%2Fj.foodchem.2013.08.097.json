These peptides are known to act as preferred dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) substrates. Five casein-derived synthetic peptides (Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr, Leu-Pro-Leu-Pro-Leu, Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Tyr, Leu-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Tyr and Ile-Pro-Ile) and a casein (CasH), whey (WPH) and lactoferrin hydrolysate (LFH) generated with gastrointestinal enzymes were incubated with DPP-IV at 37\u00b0C for 18 or 24h. Peptide breakdown was evident following incubation with DPP-IV. Different modes of DPP-IV inhibition were observed depending on the test compound. Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr, Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Tyr and Leu-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Tyr were substrate-, Leu-Pro-Leu-Pro-Leu and CasH were prodrug- while WPH and LFH were true DPP-IV inhibitors. These results are relevant for the bioactivity and bioavailability of functional foods targeting DPP-IV inhibition with potential blood glucose regulatory properties in humans.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Substrate-type inhibition"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Prodrug-type inhibition"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Antioxidant"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Bioactive peptides"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Milk"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0308814613011990", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814613011990", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84884510206", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84884510206", "pubmed-id": "24128555", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84884510206", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20130904", "$": "2013-09-04"}}}}}
