However, current studies only use conventional regression models to discover predictors of albuminuria. We have used 2 different statistical models to predict albuminuria in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a multilayer perception neural network and a conditional logistic regression. Neural network models were used to predict the level of albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, which include a matched case-control study for the population. For each case, we randomly selected 1 control matched by age and body mass index (BMI). The input variables were sex, duration of diabetes, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein/triglyceride ratio, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, and glycated hemoglobin. Age and BMI were included only in the neural network model. This model included 4 hidden layers and 1 bias. Relative error of predictions was 0.38% in the training group, 0.52% in the testing group, and 1.20% in the holdout group. The most robust predictors of albuminuria were high-density lipoprotein (21%), cholesterol (14.4%), and systolic blood pressure (9.7%). Using the conditional logistic regression model, glomerular filtration rate, time of onset to diabetes, and sex were significant indicators in the onset of albuminuria. Using a neural network model, we show that high-density lipoprotein is the most important factor in predicting albuminuria in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Our neural network model complements the current risk factor models to improve the care of patients with diabetes.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931524412004495", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931524412004495", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "84876393115", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-84876393115", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84876393115", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20130115", "$": "2013-01-15"}}}}}
