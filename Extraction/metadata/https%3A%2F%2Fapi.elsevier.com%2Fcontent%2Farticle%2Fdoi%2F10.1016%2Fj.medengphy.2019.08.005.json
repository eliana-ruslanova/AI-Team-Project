In this review, we explore the evolution and background of Computer Assisted Orthopaedic Surgery (CAOS), delving into the basic principles behind the technology and the changes in the discussion on the subject throughout the years and the impact these discussions had on the field. We found evidence that industry had an important role in driving the discussion at least in knee arthroplasty-a leading field of CAOS-with the ratio between patents and publications increased from approximately 1:10 in 2004 to almost 1:3 in 2014. The adoption of CAOS is largely restrained by economics and ergonomics with sceptics challenging the accuracy and precision of navigation during the early years of CAOS moving to patient functional improvements and long term survivorship. Nevertheless, the future of CAOS remains positive with the prospect of new technologies such as improvements in image-guided surgery, enhanced navigation systems, robotics and artificial intelligence.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Computer assisted orthopaedic surgery"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Navigation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Robotics"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Knee surgery"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Imaging technology"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Registration"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Review"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1350453319301602", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350453319301602", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85072039026", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85072039026", "pubmed-id": "31554577", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85072039026", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20190922", "$": "2019-09-22"}}}}}
