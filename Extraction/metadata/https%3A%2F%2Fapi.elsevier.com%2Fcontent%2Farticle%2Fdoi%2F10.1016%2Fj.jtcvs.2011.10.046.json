Objectives Non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Development of an early diagnosis method may improve survivals. We aimed to develop a new diagnostic model for NSCLC using serum biomarkers. Methods We set up a patient group diagnosed with NSCLC (n = 122) and a healthy control group (n = 225). Thirty serum analytes were selected on the basis of previous studies and a literature search. An antibody-bead array of 30 markers was constructed using the Luminex bead array platform (Luminex Inc, Austin, Tex) and was analyzed. Each marker was ranked by importance using the random forest method and then selected. Using selected markers, multivariate classification algorithms were constructed and were validated by application to independent validation cohort of 21 NSCLC and 28 control subjects. Results There was no difference in demographics between patients and the control population except for age (64.8 \u00b1 10.0 for patients vs 53.0 \u00b1 7.6 years for the control group). Among the 30 serum proteins, 23 showed a difference between the 2 groups (12 increased and 11 decreased in the patient group). We found the highest accuracy of multivariate classification algorithms when using the 5 highest-ranked biomarkers (A1AT, CYFRA 21-1, IGF-1, RANTES, AFP). When we applied the algorithms on a validation cohort, each method recognized the patients from the controls with high accuracy (89.8% with random forest, 91.8% with support vector machine, 88.2% with linear discriminant analysis, and 90.5% with logistic regression). Conclusions We confirmed that a new diagnostic method using 5 serum biomarkers profiling constructed by multivariate classification algorithms could distinguish NSCLC from healthy controls with high accuracy.

The clinical outcome of conventional therapies remains poor despite major efforts to improve treatment methods in the past decades. Difficulty in making an early-stage diagnosis of lung cancer is a primary reason for the lack of improvement in prognosis. 1 Thus, identification and validation of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers may improve the clinical outcome of lung cancer treatments. 2 Numerous candidate biomarkers have been reported for risk assessment, screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and selection and monitoring of therapies. Until now, the concentration or amount of one or a few specific analytes has been used as a score for considering a biomarker. 3 However, it is difficult to explain a cancer through a single gene mutation or a single protein disorder. For this reason, high-throughput molecular tools such as microarrays have been applied to find new classes of diseases to identify diagnostic markers for early detection and to predict prognosis. 4 The Food and Drug Administration has used the definition of in vitro diagnostic multivariate index assay (IVDMIA) since 2007. With IVDMIA, the score is calculated from a number of measurement values such as gene expression values and protein concentrations using the algorithm. 3 For example, MammaPrint of 70 genes in breast cancer and Ova-1 protein in ovarian cancer are approved as IVDMIAs and are applied in a real clinical environment. Our study aimed to identify several biomarkers of non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to construct prediction models to diagnose NSCLC. Patients and Methods The Institutional Review Board of the Seoul National University College of Medicine approved this study, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients for this study (IRB No. H-0910-005-295). From October 2008 to March 2010, we collected blood samples from patients who underwent curative surgery for NSCLC. All patients underwent curative surgical resection and lymph node dissection. Whole blood samples were gathered during the operation with the usual blood-collecting methods and were contained within SST II tubes (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). After coagulation, with the tubes kept upright at room temperature for 2 hours, sera were separated by centrifugation. All the vials containing sera were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until analysis. There were 69 adenocarcinomas (ADCs) and 53 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). We gathered clinical variables such as age, gender, pathologic TNM stage, cell type, differentiation, and size. A total of 225 blood samples collected from healthy persons who visited the hospital for medical checkups and agreed to participate in the study were used as a control for normal states. Serum separation and storage procedure were the same as for the NSCLC group. Selected Serum Proteins We selected 30 serum markers from 55 original markers in this study. Fifty-five original markers were selected from 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry, and a literature search. Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT), apolipoprotein (Apo) A1, ApoA4, haptoglobin \u03b1, pro-ApoA1, and transthyretin were discovered with 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. ApoH, beta-2 microglobulin, C-reactive protein, free hemoglobin, serum amyloid A, and vitamin D\u2013binding protein were discovered using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. Forty-three other proteins were selected through a literature search. We used various combinations of keywords such as \u201ccancer,\u201d \u201clung cancer,\u201d \u201cNSCLC,\u201d \u201cbiomarker,\u201d \u201cmarker,\u201d \u201cprotein,\u201d \u201cimmunoassay,\u201d and \u201creview\u201d using an electric database. From 55 original markers, we chose 30 proteins that were significantly differentially expressed between the cancer and the normal controls in our pilot study with 4500 serum samples of 5 types of cancer (breast, colon, stomach, liver, and lung). 5 The list of selected analytes is shown in Table 1 . Multiplexed Bead-Based Immunoassay Procedure We used multiplexed particle-based flow cytometric assay methods to measure the amount of serum analytes. Bead array kits or antibodies for the construction of the plate were purchased from the following manufacturers: Abcam (Cambridge, United Kingdom), Acris Affinity Bioreagents Inc (Rockford, Ill), ALPCO (Salem, NH), Antibodies GmbH (Herford, Germany), Bethyl (Montgomery, Tex), Biodesign International (Saco, Maine), Calbiochem (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), Chemicon (Temecula, Calif), DRG Diagnostics (Marburg, Germany), LabFrontier (Gyeonggi, Korea), Millipore (Billerica, Mass), R&D Systems (Minneapolis, Minn), Rules-based Medicine (Austin, Tex), Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc (Santa Cruz, Calif), Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, Mo), and US Biological (Swampscott, Mass). Luminex-200 (Luminex Inc, Austin, Tex) uses a sandwich immunoassay with fluorescent-bead\u2013based technology allowing multiplex analysis of up to 100 different analytes during a single process. Multiplex assay was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol described previously. 5 Statistical Analysis The Student t test was used to evaluate the significance of differences in individual serum biomarker levels expressed between the NSCLC group (n = 122) and the healthy control group (n = 225). For multivariate analysis of biomarker combinations, we used various analytic methods (random forest [RF], support vector machine [SVM], linear discriminant analysis [LDA], and logistic regression [LRM]). From a total number of 347 samples, we used 249 samples that had measured values of all 30 analytes. For constructing the classification algorithms, 121 NSCLC samples and 128 control samples were divided between the model developing sets (100 in the NSCLC and 100 in the control) and the validation sets (21 in the NSCLC and 28 in the control). Each marker was ranked by importance using the RF method and put into modeling according to their ranking. For importance ranking, 70 samples from each group were randomly selected 100 times, and average scores of 100 times importance were used. After ranking, 70 samples from each group were randomly assigned to the training sets, and the remaining 30 samples were assigned to the test sets. We constructed models in the training set and applied to the test set. Models were made with all possible combinations of selected markers to select the most ideal marker set. Final validation was applied to the validation set that was independent of the construction of the model. This 3-step procedure was repeated 50 times with changing training sets. We also changed the total number of markers put into modeling and compared the results with the receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the curve (Figure E1). The modeling procedure was shown in Figure 1 . All calculations were performed using the R software (http://www.r-project.org/). Results Clinical Characteristics There were 122 NSCLC samples (ADC, 69; SCC, 53) and 225 healthy control samples. There were 79 men (64.8%), and the mean age of the patients was 64.8 years (standard deviation, 10.0 years) in the NSCLC group. There was a difference in age between the patients and the control population (64.8 \u00b1 10.0 for patients vs 53.0 \u00b1 7.6 years for control group; P < .01). The most common stage of cancer was stage 1 (68.8%). Table 2 shows the clinical information of 249 samples used in modeling procedures. The serum concentrations of analytes are shown in Table 3 . Twenty-three proteins showed a difference between the 2 groups. A1AT, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), cancer antigen 125, cancer antigen 19-9, carcinoembryonic antigen, C-reactive protein, cytokeratin fragment (CYFRA) 21-1, D-dimer, hemoglobin, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, interleukin 6, and total prostate-specific antigen were increased, whereas alpha-2 macroglobulin, ApoA1, ApoC2, ApoC3, epidermal growth factor receptor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, pro-ApoA1, regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, transthyretin, and vitronectin were decreased in the patient group. Multivariate Classification Algorithm We performed a multivariate classification algorithm with 121 NSCLC samples and 128 control samples. Samples were divided into 3 groups: training, test, and validation sets. The details are given in the Materials and Methods section. Among 30 proteins, hemoglobin, D-dimer, and interleukin 6 were excluded because those proteins could have been affected by the surgical procedure itself. 6-13 We selected the highest-ranked proteins in order by RF importance (Table E1). Multivariate classification algorithms were constructed from selected markers using 4 analytical methods. We found the greatest accuracy of multivariate classification algorithms when using the 5 highest-ranked biomarkers (A1AT, CYFRA 21-1, IGF-1, RANTES, and AFP) (Table 4 ). When we applied the algorithms on a validation cohort, each method recognized the NSCLC patients from the normal controls with high accuracy (89.8% with RF, 91.8% with SVM, 88.2% with LDA, and 90.5% with LRM). On the receiver operating characteristic curve, the areas under the curve of the algorithm were 0.991 with RF, 0.984 with SVM, 0.987 with LDA, and 0.982 with LRM (Figure E1). The correlation of the markers to the final model is shown in Figure E2. A1AT, CYFRA 21-1, IGF-1, and AFP increased the tendency of cancer with higher serum concentrations. We analyzed the sensitivity of our algorithms according to histologic type. The sensitivity of SCC was better compared with that of ADC (96.2% in SCC vs 89.7% in ADC with RF) (Table E2). The incidence of incorrect diagnosis was 1 in SCC and 8 in ADC. Incorrect diagnosis was not related to pathologic stage, tumor size, differentiation, or R0 resection. Discussion Biomarkers of NSCLC can be obtained from several materials such as sputum, blood, and lung cancer tissue. In this study, we used serum rather than lung cancer tissue because it is easily acquired via a less invasive approach, which is very important in a clinical setting. Multiplexed bead-based flow cytometric assay is used increasingly with high-throughput analysis. Polystyrene/latex microspheres of 3- to 5-\u03bcm diameter were used to detect a reaction between serum analytes and antibodies. The fluidity also increases the chance of reaction. The variety of size of beads and intensity of fluorescence make multiple analytic processes possible simultaneously. This method has been used widely not only in oncology but also for immune diseases, infectious diseases, and diagnosis of stroke with accurate measurement of cytokines and immunoglobulin. 14 The range of observational errors is known to be not large, 15 and in this study, intra-assay precision ranged from 2% to 16% and interassay precision ranged from 6% to 19% during the experiment. Gorelik and associates 16 used this analytic method to construct a diagnostic model using interleukins 6 and 8, vascular endothelial growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and cancer antigen 125; they reported 84% sensitivity and 95% specificity. Linkov and colleagues 17 also used a flow cytometric assay to diagnose head and neck cancer using 25 serum biomarkers and reported 84.5% sensitivity and 98% specificity. However, for NSCLC, no previous studies have used this method. Of a total number of 347 samples, we used 249 samples that had measured values of all 30 analytes in modeling procedures. Although the gender ratio was similar between the 2 groups, the control group was about 14 years younger than the cancer group. To see the effect of age, we analyzed serum biomarkers according to age in the control group. We compared the mean concentration of analytes among subjects in their 40s, 50s, and 60s using analysis of variance. There was no differences except \u03b22-microglobulin (P < .01), pro-ApoA1 (P = .01), and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (P < .01), which increased in elder age. However, those 3 markers were not included in our final model. In IVDMIA, the score is calculated from a number of measurement values, and the algorithm, the method of calculating the score, is critical. 3 We used 4 analytic methods for the score-calculating algorithm. In LRM, overfitting is problematic, especially when the sample size is small and there are many variables in 1 model. 18 RF is known to be superior in minimizing this weakness with the random inputs and classification trees as much as possible without variable deletion. 19,20 We used the 5 highest-ranked biomarkers rather than all 27 biomarkers in modeling. Although it is difficult to define the ideal number that is included in modeling, it is practical to reduce the number of biomarkers if the same accuracy can be achieved. We constructed the models by reducing the total number of analytes and selected the ideal model considering accuracy and area under the curve of the training set. We validated using the validation set, and it was confirmed with high accuracy (89.8% with RF, 91.8% with SVM, 88.2% with LDA, and 90.5% with LRM). We used only 1 validation cohort in this study, so we attempted to overcome this limitation by repeating modeling 50 times within estimation sample set. According to analytic methods, the results are relatively constant. In our algorithm, SCC showed better sensitivity than did ADC (96.2% in SCC vs 89.7% in ADC with RF) (Table E2). Inasmuch as the purpose of our model was to diagnose lung cancer, we did not include cell type as a factor. However, to predict prognosis, consideration of cell type may be necessary. Most SCC patients were smokers (94.3%), whereas only 26.5% of ADC patients were smokers. Inasmuch as cell type and smoking are closely related, we also have to consider smoking effect. In this study, we could not analyze smoking factors owing to lack of smoking status in the normal group. The final model was developed with A1AT, CYRFA 21-1, IGF-1, RANTES, and AFP. By the model, 9 in the cancer group and 6 in the control group were erroneously classified among 249 samples. According to the cell types of NSCLC, ADC was more frequently misclassified than SCC (ADC, 8; SCC, 1). According to the stage, there was no difference in terms of incorrect diagnosis. After surgery, 11 patients had recurrence of lung cancer. When we compared the model score according to the recurrence, there was no difference between the group with recurrence and the group without recurrence (recurrence group, 0.913 \u00b1 0.03; nonrecurrence group, 0.869 \u00b1 0.02), which suggested that our model might not be good for prognostic prediction. According to the RF importance, A1AT is highly expressed in both ADC and SCC, whereas IGF-1 and RANTES is highly expressed in ADC, and CYFRA 21-1 and AFP is highly expressed in SCC. A1AT is a glycoprotein and an antagonist of serum trypsin. In the body, A1AT is elevated in the acute inflammatory phase to protect tissues from digestive enzymes (especially elastase) produced by inflammatory cells. A1AT deficiency is related to destructive congenital lung parenchymal disease. Hamrita and coworkers 21 reported elevated A1AT levels in patients with invasive breast cancer. CYFRA 21-1 (cytokeratin 19 fragment) is reported as being related to lung cancer. Lai and associates 22 reported that a high serum level of CYFRA 21-1 is related to the advanced stage and poor prognosis in SCC. Pujol and colleagues 23 meta-analyzed 2063 patients and reported that serum concentrations of more than 3.6 ng/mL showed a lower survival than those with less and the hazard ratio was 1.88. This study also showed a high serum level of CYFRA 21-1 in SCC patients. IGF-1 is reported to be related to multiple cancers such as endometrial cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, and lung cancer. 24 Inasmuch as IGF-1 is a primary mediator of growth hormone, it relates to growth and differentiation of the cell and to apoptosis. In summary, we confirmed that our new diagnostic method using 5 serum biomarkers profiling constructed by multivariate classification algorithms could distinguish persons with NSCLC from healthy controls with high accuracy. Additional future study of a larger population is necessary to prove the usefulness of this method for early diagnosis for NSCLC.

Development of an early diagnosis method may improve survivals. We aimed to develop a new diagnostic model for NSCLC using serum biomarkers. Methods We set up a patient group diagnosed with NSCLC (n = 122) and a healthy control group (n = 225). Thirty serum analytes were selected on the basis of previous studies and a literature search. An antibody-bead array of 30 markers was constructed using the Luminex bead array platform (Luminex Inc, Austin, Tex) and was analyzed. Each marker was ranked by importance using the random forest method and then selected. Using selected markers, multivariate classification algorithms were constructed and were validated by application to independent validation cohort of 21 NSCLC and 28 control subjects. Results There was no difference in demographics between patients and the control population except for age (64.8 \u00b1 10.0 for patients vs 53.0 \u00b1 7.6 years for the control group). Among the 30 serum proteins, 23 showed a difference between the 2 groups (12 increased and 11 decreased in the patient group). We found the highest accuracy of multivariate classification algorithms when using the 5 highest-ranked biomarkers (A1AT, CYFRA 21-1, IGF-1, RANTES, AFP). When we applied the algorithms on a validation cohort, each method recognized the patients from the controls with high accuracy (89.8% with random forest, 91.8% with support vector machine, 88.2% with linear discriminant analysis, and 90.5% with logistic regression).
