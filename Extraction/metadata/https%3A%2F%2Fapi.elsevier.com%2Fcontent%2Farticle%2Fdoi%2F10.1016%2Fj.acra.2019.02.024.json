An additional external validation was performed on a cohort of 228 CT-scans from gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine cancer patients. Image acquisition was performed according to each centers\u2019 standard CT protocol for single portal venous phase, portal venous acquisition. The reference gold standard for the classification of PVP-timing as either optimal or nonoptimal was based on experienced radiologists' consensus opinion. The algorithm performed automated localization (on axial slices) of the portal vein and aorta upon which a novel dual input Convolutional Neural Network calculated a probability of the optimal PVP-timing.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  The algorithm automatically computed a PVP-timing score in 3 seconds and reached area under the curve of 0.837 (95% CI: 0.765, 0.890) in validation set and 0.844 (95% CI: 0.786, 0.889) in external validation set.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusion\n                  A fully automated, deep-learning derived PVP-timing algorithm was developed to classify scans\u2019 contrast-enhancement timing and identify scans with optimal PVP-timing. The rapid identification of such scans will aid in the analysis of quantitative (radiomics) features used to characterize tumors and changes in enhancement with treatment in a multitude of settings including quantitative response criteria such as Choi and MASS which rely on reproducible measurement of enhancement.\n               \n            ", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessArticle": false, "openaccessType": null, "openArchiveArticle": false, "openaccessSponsorName": null, "openaccessSponsorType": null, "openaccessUserLicense": null, "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Artificial intelligence"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Quality control"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Radiography"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Abdominal"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Tomography"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "X-ray computed"}], "link": [{"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1076633219301710", "@rel": "self", "@_fa": "true"}, {"@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1076633219301710", "@rel": "scidir", "@_fa": "true"}]}, "scopus-id": "85066065755", "scopus-eid": "2-s2.0-85066065755", "pubmed-id": "31151901", "link": {"@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85066065755", "@rel": "abstract"}, "originalText": {"xocs:doc": {"xocs:meta": {"xocs:open-access": {"xocs:oa-article-status": {"@is-open-access": "0", "@is-open-archive": "0"}}, "xocs:available-online-date": {"@yyyymmdd": "20190528", "$": "2019-05-28"}}}}}
